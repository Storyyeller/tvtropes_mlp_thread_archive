            Actually,  the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McDonalds" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McDonalds">McDonald's</a> toys are pretty good. The molds are more show-accurate than most toys out there,  and the painting on the is decent,  if the colours aren't too wild. I have a Rarity and a Pinkie. Pinkie's painting is pretty much flawless,  but Rarity's mane leaks onto her coat a bit. The only real complaints I have about them is A) they have one iteration of their cutie mark on a single flank only,  rather than three on both sides and B) the little knob on their head to attach the keyring/brush. Aside from that,  they're pretty decent. And at about a buck fifty a pop,  significantly cheaper than any other toy.
<p></p>I'll still probs buy the Zecora,  though. Just because,  fuck,  my little Zebra. Awesome,  you guys.

            NEW EPISODE WAS A BLAST!
<p></p>I'm glad Twilight finally got over her Super OCD. At first,  I thought they had already addressed that in Lesson Zero,  but then I remembered that the lesson was something completely different.
<p></p>But what made Cerberus abandon his duty of guarding the Gates of Hell?
<p></p>Unrelated: Although I don't normally like Ho Yay/Les Yay shipping,  I find Apple-Dash to be adorable. And considering that I also hate how everypony thinks Dash is a lesbian,  that is really something.
<p></p>Also unrelated: I saw the extended version of the title theme. And then I saw it again,  and again,  and again. AWESOME!

            One last thing: My mom is in the hospital for some reason (I forgot what it was). I decided that every time I go visit her,  I will follow Pinkie's example and smile the whole time. Laughter and smiles are the best medicine!

            Just watched the episode with Iron Will in it the other day. I didn't like it much - there was no <em>reason</em> for the ending. Fluttershy just up and *poof*,  suddenly had self esteem. And Rarity and Pinkie seemed out of character. They ran off crying? <em>Really</em>?

            Well,  wouldn't YOU be heartbroken if a friend suddenly became a raging jerkass and then tore you apart with a harsh and brutal verbal beatdown?
<p></p>And I reiterate,  IRON WILL MUST GET INTO THE VS. SAXTON HALE MOD!
<p></p>Seriously,  when I saw him,  Saxton Hale was the first thing that came to mind. He's like the most masculine being in all of Equestria,  right after Rainbow Dash.

            Something clicked between Pinkie's and Rarity's knocking on Fluttershy's boarded-up door and Iron Will's knocking on Fluttershy's not-anymore-boarded-up door?
<p></p>Re: running off crying — First off,  it's was pretty much their life's purpose that was being attacked. Second,  coming from <em>Fluttershy</em> of all people,  the <em>last</em> person they'd expect to give a verbal lashing for whatever reason.

            Just the way it happened seemed... contrived. I can definitely see them crying,  yes,  but the specific way it happened seemed <em>off</em> to me. Too fast,  maybe. I don't know.

            Yeah,  I didn't like the Iron Will episode.  Fluttershy's transformations were way too over the top.
<p></p>Maybe she was PMSing?  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">  Mood swings back and forth?
<p></p>I feel they changed her character view a lot in that,  but admittably,  standing up to Iron Will wasn't her first assertive act,  anyway.  When her <strong>friends are threatened</strong>,  she stands up and stands hard.  Dragon,  anyone?

            Yeah I find it hard to believe Fluttershy doesn't have confidence in herself and needs training if she can take down a whole bear,  dragon,  and Cerebus.  It's just this problem I have with the writers who can't seem to figure out which should be played for laughs.

            Well,  one theory I had is that some of the episodes aren't in chronological order. That could explain <strong>SOME</strong> things.

            I dunno. The episode was a little fast,  that's true; but Fluttershy's behaviour seemed perfectly in character to me.
<p></p>She simply has no understanding of how to deal with conflict in a mature way.
<p></p>Either she just freezes,  as is her usual,  or she goes all-out — which might be appropriate when dealing with a raging dragon,  but not so much when dealing with a rude shopkeeper. She is clearly incredibly skilled in working with animals,  even potentially dangerous ones; and there was no reason for the bear,  the cerberus,  the cockatrice or the manticore to trigger her social anxiety. But when "people" enter in contrast with her,  she has no idea of what to do.
<p></p>Furthermore,  behind her near-pathological shyness,  Fluttershy has been established to have a rather critical and acerbic personality,  I think: see her opinion of Rarity's dress,  for example,  or the way in which she behaved while discorded.
<p></p>It was a very nice bit of character development to see her final interaction with Iron Will,  in which she <em>finally</em> managed to hold her ground without being unnecessarily aggressive.

            Yeah,  but with Rarity,  they're really close friends.  If she can say things like that to anyone,  it would be her,  (and Rarity <strong>did</strong> push.)
<p></p>With Iron Will... he's a monster.  How many times did they point that out?  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
