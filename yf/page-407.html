            Personally,  I thought that "You Gotta Share,  You Gotta Care" wasn't half bad. I'm guessing the reason behind the poor reception from the Buffalo and Appleoosans was because they've never experienced a Pinkie Pie Performance before.

<p></p><div class="quoteblock"><strong>Combination Attack: Mane 6</strong>
<p></p><strong>The Elements of Harmony:</strong>  Only when all of the Mane 6 are in the same party,  and their HP is greater than -1,  can the Elements of Harmony be used.  Only Twilight Sparkle can call this attack,  and it has to be declared before Initiative is rolled on the turn that it will be used.  For the duration of the round,  the Mane 6 count as one character for determining Initiative and success/failure rolls.  For this purpose,  the highest roll between all of the Mane 6 is used.  The attack works in much the same way as a Desperation Attack.  Roll 1d100 against total of percentage remaining HP for Mane 6.  On success,  the Elements of Harmony reduce enemy to 0 HP (Half-Consciousness) and has a 30% chance to cast Petrify.  If the attack fails,  the Mane 6 lose their action and take a penalty of -10 for all d100 rolls for the next round.  If The Elements of Harmony is used,  no other Desperation attacks may be used by any memebr of the Mane 6 for the remainder of the encounter (including Meltdown).
</div>
<p></p>As of now,  the game has two player factions:  The Mane 6 and The Order.
<p></p>The Order aren't <em>antagonists</em> so much as they operate on the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">greyer</a> side of the morality scale.

            From my understanding,  The Elements of Harmony were created by some strange higher being as a means to destroy some sort of evil god or cosmic destroyer.
<p></p>I know for sure that the being in question is not Celestia,  since she stated that they were <em>discovered</em> by her and Luna when they rebelled against Discord's reign.

            Maybe we'll find out how the Elements were created in Season 3?  Although,  I don't think they were meant to <em>destroy</em> anything,  since the worst (best?) we've seen it do so far is <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Seal Evil in a Can</a>,  hence only reducing the enemy to 0 HP rather than negative whatever it would take for them to die (it has to do with Challenge Rating,  and I'm terrible at math).
<p></p>I've considered adding a stipulation that the Elements of Harmony can only be used when the Enemy's Challenge Rating is much,  much higher than the Mane 6's.

            @Karl: Well it's clear that the powers of the Elements reach godlike levels,  since they were able to defeat Nightmare Moon and lift Discord's curse. Because they are primarily used to defeat or contain evil beings of immense power,  it would make sense that their original purpose was to confront an evil <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> or a cosmic destroyer.

            Their effects seem a bit too benign for them to have been intended primarily as weapons,  I think.
<p></p>Also,  after they defeated Discord,  they somehow repaired all the damage he caused.
<p></p>If I were to speculate,  I would say that their main purpose is some sort of "terraforming" - they strike an environment,  and they attempt to make it a pleasant place to live in. Hence,  when they are directed to a powerful threat,  they imprison,  redeem or incapacitate them.
<p></p>But for example,  it seems very likely to me that Nightmare Moon or Discord would have been incapable to use the Elements to get rid of Celestia - she poses no threat to the well-being of Equestria,  and she's actually one of its primary defenders,  so striking her with the Elements would actually <em>empower</em> her.

            I said an <em>evil</em> physical god.
<p></p>And the Elements seem to fit the standards of a weapon. They are powerful enough to purge or contain evil forces that the Magic of Friendship could not handle by itself. I can easily imagine that they are capable of annihilating beings of pure evil with enough charge behind the blast of magical energy.
