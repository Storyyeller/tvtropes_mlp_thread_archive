<p></p>That would be because the $10 plastic recorders they give you are pieces of shit.  Hell,  I dug mine out after spending over half my life in band,  and I can <em>barely</em> hold a decent tone on them.

According to what I'm reading,  they are harassing a certain "Yamino" on <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeviantArt" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeviantArt">deviantART</a> â€” from the context,  I'd guess that she is one of those who complained about Derpy,  and this is their "revenge".
<p></p>The first poster asked them to stop,  and the rest replied with typical 4chan idiocy.
<p></p>Derpy disapproves. (I would link an image of a disapproving Derpy,  but I don't know of any.)
<p></p>EDIT: I <em>loved</em> playing the recorder at school. Wasn't half bad at it,  for a kid,  as far as I remember.

            I hated it so much.  You can only listen to a room full of 25 kids tooting Hot Cross Buns over and over on cheap instruments that can't even be tuned and are hideously easy to overblow and go into shrill notes for <em>five years</em> and not go completely insane.
<p></p>Maybe it just hit me harder because my big sister is an amazing musician and I had a decent sense of these things early on.

            Gave you? Eh,  we had to buy our own. And I don't think recorders are <em>meant</em> to be tuned... in any case I discovered that a) I don't like playing instruments and b) even if I had,  I would not have managed the deep tones.

            Yamino is basically the Sonichu guy in miniature.  You can only be an obnoxious hypocritical attention whore on the internet for so long before the trolls move in,  and stubbornly continuing to be an obnoxious hypocrite <em>at</em> the trolls just kinda...yeah.  Everyone involved is an asshole,  and there's basically no right thing to do except keep your distance and keep a bottle of Rad-X on you.

            As am I.  And yeah,  the whole Yamino thing really bothers me,  especially because she seems to be totally running with it and using the people on 4chan as an example of bronydom as a whole,  and they're totally feeding into it.  A lot of them even admitted they were totally aware of this and don't even care.

            The problem with just ignoring it is that it won't stop here.  Fear of this sort of incident popping up anywhere possible (and <em>anywhere</em> is possible â€” people get offended at the weirdest,  most innocuous shit) is exactly what cows studios out of being creative and into...well...the previous 3 or so generations of My Little Pony.
<p></p>Not to mention doing what they did because Derpy "did not stay true to the core message of friendship" is frankly orders of magnitude more offensive than anything that could possibly have happened on the show.  "Everyone deserves friendship â€” except the mentally handicapped of course,  keep those fuckers under wraps so nobody has to look at them."  The hell?!

            The argument is apparently that she was taken as a parody of the mentally handicapped rather than an accurate portrayal,  but your mileage will really vary with that one.  Like with anything,  people are going to see what they want to see.  Most of her supporters see a clumsy,  lazy eyed pony who manages to work through her challanges and still be a productive citizen,  while her detractors seem to think she's out and out retarded.

            Well,  apart from ignoring them and showing support and appreciation for the show,  it's not like we can â€” or should â€” do anything. I think that 4chan is a waste of bytes if there ever was any; but quite frankly,  I have better things to do with my life than argue with them.
<p></p>As for Derpy,  I still don't get why she was supposed to be mentally handicapped. Since when are clumsiness,  strabismus,  or a somewhat deep voice signs of mental issues?

            @Carcio: You're right.  My biggest problem with it is that people like Yamino are sending people who work on the show transcripts of the things the 4chan idiots are saying as if they're a non-biased example of how bronies behave.  She even managed to get a response from Amy Keating.  The problem is still with the 4chan trolls and /b/ronies,  but crap like that could potentially spell trouble for the community.
<p></p>@Kay: Yeah,  you've missed a lot.

            Carc: Oh definitely,  arguing with 4chan is a waste of oxygen that could be better spent burning rubber and huffing the fumes.  As is arguing with the likes of Yamino â€” when she blocks all coherent comments as spam and only leaves crazy shit visible,  her grindin' axe is pretty obvious.
<p></p>The thing is,  the message <em>Hasbro</em> gets out of this has to be clear that it's not cool to legitimize a small handful of obnoxious white knights with a chip on their shoulder (especially when the very people they claim to be speaking on behalf of are calling bullshit left and right),  and that outright censorship does more harm than good.

            @Ninja: Yamino is a Deviantart artist who spoke out against Derpy for being,  in her opinion,  offensive,  and 4chan spammed her with hate and death threats.

            I think what gets me about this whole thing is how it just seems so fate-conspired to be as hideously awkward as possible.  I mean,  the original scene had Derpy doing actual work â€” she was supposed to be kicking spare lightning out of clouds so nopony got fried at the town gathering â€” and actually doing a decent job until a stray bolt hit the town hall.
<p></p>Executives cut the first half of it for length,  effectively keeping the gag at the end but cutting the character.  Which also made it look like she was just shooting lightning everywhere and breaking stuff for no reason.  Then Tabitha mistakenly voiced her as a dude,  which made her sound kinda Downsy.  Keep in mind all this happened behind the writer's back.
<p></p>I mean...<a class="urllink" href="http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw607_130331842872.gif">wow.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>â—Š</small>  This is the kind of crazy Murphy's Law shit I hope never happens to any game I work on.

            A couple weeks ago,  there was a My Little Pony video that used electro swing in it.
<p></p>Through that,  I discovered what is possibly my second favorite genre of music.
<p></p>And people said that show didn't teach you anything!
<p></p>EDIT: and it seems that the people there do not appreciate this fact,  and wish that they could keep their music to the "true fans".
<p></p>Look,  how you discover something is not as important as why you watch it.  If the people are watchin to "LOL PONIES",  then fine,  be angry.  If the people,  like me,  found something interesting in an unorthodox way,  and main thought is "Why haven't I heard of this sooner?",  then you're just a hipster.
