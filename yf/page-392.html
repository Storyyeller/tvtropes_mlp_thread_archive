Some people go batshit crazy over it.
<p></p>Just to be clear,  I said NEARLY every troper that's not a brony. I'm aware that there are tropers who don't like the show,  but don't have a problem with people watching it. Don't even get me started on this one person who blamed mlp fim for Firefly getting Canceled....

            I feel rather sorry and am yet bemused by those who flip out over Feeling Pinkie Keen. It's not a "religion is automatically right and atheism is dumb dur hur" episode. The execution of the aesop wasn't the best,  but I don't see why it gets some people so angry?
<p></p>When it all comes down to it,  this is a show about colorful ponies learning about friendship. Why get yourself worked up over something so sweet and inoffensive?

            I think it's less taking offense at the show itself and more rebelling against how it shows up <em>everywhere</em>.  They don't hate the show itself,  they hate the fact that they can't get away from it.
<p></p>And yeah,  the only religious people who would get offended by this show are the fringe groups who think everything is Satanic anyway.  I'm Christian and find nothing offensive about it; in fact almost all of the moral line up with traditional Christian teaching anyway.  I tend to just ignore the people who are dumb about stuff like that.
<p></p>@Accela: Yeah,  I didn't get that either.  I can understand the initial kerfuffle with how they worded it (it sounded vaguely religious,  and even as a religious person I find <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeliefMakesYouStupid" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeliefMakesYouStupid">Belief Makes You Stupid</a> to be idiotic),  but did anyone <em>really</em> think that a show like MLP would try to tackle a science/religion debate?

            It's simple*:
<p></p>Non-brony: OMFG MLP GOT FIREFLY CANCELED
<p></p>Brony: Um,  no,  it didn't.  The two shows are unrelated,  and MLP wasn't even in development when Firefly was cancelled. It's most likely the fault of the network airing the episodes out of order,  resulting in the ratings being to bad to justify ordering more episodes.
<p></p>Non-brony: <a class="urllink" href="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/185/nickcage.jpeg">NUH UH IT WAS PONIEZ!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small>

            Sorry,  but the last time I saw that was Months ago. I can't even remember what thread it was on,  or even if it was on tv tropes. I just remember that it was so facepalm-worthy that I had to mention it. If I knew where it was,  I'd gladly tell you.
<p></p>Make no mistake though,  because I did see it,  I just don't exactly remember where it was. Like I said,  it was Months ago when I saw that example of stupidity.

            Indeed he does. One thing I like about his art is that most of his perverted stuff {Besides Molestia} tends to be rather sweet despite the content,  and he has alot of cute and badass drawings too.

            I love how his style,  even when dealing with sex and other things,  still fits with the style of the show. It's a bit disconcerting at first but I like it all the more for that.

            Yeah,  I generally like his art.

            I'd consider myself a rationalist,  and while I was somewhat put off by "Feeling Pinkie Keen, " it's certainly not anything over which I'm going to lose sleep.  I kind of wish the Aesop had been more explicitly "just because you can't explain it,  doesn't mean there isn't an explanation",  rather than "there are certain things that can't be explained,  period",  but that's kind of an unreasonable expectation to have for a 22-minute cartoon,  even one as high-quality as FIM.
<p></p>And yeah,  a lot of the hate is the result of good old-fashined <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a>.  I will say that in my experience,  the non-Brony Tropers pretty much leave Bronies be so long as we don't try to push the show on them.  Though clearly you've had a different experience,  Marston.
