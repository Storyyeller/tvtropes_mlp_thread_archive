            What really scares me is that there were multiple videos.  From what I read in the thread though,  the second one was just a fanfic about Twilight having diarrhea.  I'm curious as to what the last one is,  but I think it's best I don't find out.

            -sigh- Why am I not surprised this came out of 4Chan?
<p></p>If it came from anywhere else,  I would have been shocked. But with all the screwed up stuff that goes on in 4Chan,  I'm really not surprised that something like <em>that</em> happened.
<p></p>Now for topic change,  cause I feel that the sooner this one dies,  the better.
<p></p>To my most extreme pleasure,  the same guy who did the X-Com crossover pic with Engineer Applejack made another pic with the rest of the Mane Six on the latest Drawfriend. The roles they had were perfect! Rainbow Dash was a pilot for a Skyranger,  Twilight was a squad commander (that's my guess,  since she had a Laser Rifle,  Motion Scanner and Personal Armor),  Rarity appeared to be a scout (she had only a basic Rifle and the standard armor),  Pinkie was a Heavy Weapons Pony with a Rocket Launcher and Power Suit,  and Fluttershy was a medic.
<p></p>To tell you the truth,  I wouldn't even consider giving Pinkie a Rocket Launcher or other heavy weapons. She might be good with a Party Cannon,  but I wouldn't risk my squad getting blasted to smithereens by a rocket going off by accident.

            Twilight should have had a Psi Amp instead of the Motion Scanner,  and the Scanner should have been carried by Rarity,  since she appeared to be a Scout or some sort of Redshirt in that pic. It would be really fitting too. Rarity's magic specializes in finding jewels and mineral nodes,  so it'd make sense if she'd specialize in finding enemies. And since Twilight is skilled with magic,  she'd be excellent with Psionics.

            That's how I usually responded to a Lobsterman mission in TFTD in the past,  but that was before I learned how to play the game right so that I would be prepared.
<p></p>I never see a lot of artwork for <em>Terror From the Deep</em> though,  and that's a real shame. Even though it was just a palette swap of UFO,  it was still a great game,  dare I say better than the original. Plus,  I'd like to see something from that game done in the style of most X-Com fan artwork I've seen.

            I heard a remix of NotACleverPony's "For The New Lunar Republic" that,  if I remember correctly,  had omitted the techno and left in the sad strings. When I listened it,  it reminded me of an Ancient Monologue cutscene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Freespace" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Freespace">Freespace</a></em>. I could already hear the narrator in my head...
<p></p><em>We know our fate. We are being eliminated. We we traveled Subspace,  the cosmic destroyers took note. When we conquered and colonized in galaxies where we had no place,  the destruction and the anguish and the loss were the clarion call of our doom,  and so the Destroyers came for us...</em>

            Tomorrow,  Twilight travels through time!
<p></p>Try saying <em>that</em> ten times fast!
<p></p>Been thinking about the My Little Portal character comparisons I did a while ago. Instead of making Luna GLaDOS,  I think she'd be Caroline,  while Nightmare Moon gets GLaDOS.
<p></p>Did I do one for ATLAS and P-Body? I don't think I did. Well,  I'm guessing Apple Bloom and Scootaloo can take them,  since I gave Sweetie Belle the Space Core,  and I don't want the other Crusaders left out.
<p></p>Another note: Someone a while back said the "Suited For Success" was the episode where Fluttershy became a model. That is incorrect. That would be "Green Is Not Your Color".
