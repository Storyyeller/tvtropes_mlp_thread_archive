            So,  a crappy idea for a fanfic that I may never do for various reasons:
<p></p>As I postd a few pages ago,  I had an idea for an OC Stallion,  which is pretty much the ponification of a Pontiac Trans Am,  including a few colorization clues such as being mostly white with blue highlights,  similiar to the original 1969 Trans Am when introduced (don't let the liars tell you that the only REAL Trans Am's were black from the factory,  they're wrong) along with a blue and gray Phoenix cutie mark,  which is my current avatar (the emblem is prety boss).
<p></p>Said stallion is an older Pegasus,  a retired member of the Royal Guard,  and specifically,  a Messenger,  used to fly around priority messages from place to place (not really needed now,  since Celestia can do all of that on her own).  He was injured and disqualified for flight duty,  so he took an early medical retirement,  and went back to live out his remaining years in Ponyville.  Has three grown children (probably the same age as the Mane Six or thereabouts),  so his own age is in that area between Mature and Elderly - basically,  he's showing signs of old age,  but is still active enough that he doesn't need help much.  His personality has aged and mellowed somewhat,  but he is still fiercely independent but not crude.  He places high value on individuality,  and prides himself on excellent flying skills,  although his forced-retirement injury limits his flying ability to a lot of gliding and only a bit of actual wing-flapping.  Has a very wide wingspan,  so gliding is easy,  if he carefuly sticks to using thermals and updrafts.
<p></p>The premise of the story is that some wierd thing made all the Royal Guards go missing,  so Celestia and Luna put out a decree that all retired guards are to report at once to Canterlot to fill the vacancies,  and the Mane Six will go off and get to the bottom of the msytery.
<p></p>Our aged protagonist,  named <strong>Firebird</strong> (basically,  same thing as a Phoenix,  so maybe he gets along great with Celestia's pet),  will be assigned to oversee the guard detail for Their Royal Highnesses and to interface with the Mane Six from time to time,  but he has a lot ot learn about how to deal with Princess Luna,  as he retired before her return.
<p></p>The moral of the story is supposed to be about Ageism,  and to not discount the wisdom of Elders,  while also not discounting the radical ideas of Youth - exemplified by Firebird and Twilight getting into a huge argument (a number of times) about how their investigation is supposed to go.
<p></p>I did up a few pages of it,  but got stuck.  Princess Luna is difficult to write dialogue for,  without defaulting to TRADITIONAL ROYAL CANTERLOT CAPSLOCK all the time.
<p></p>Also,  I'd think someone else could do better.

            ^Huh. That story sounds pretty intresting actully. BTW,  if one of the reasons you won't write it is because of the new luna,  you could tone down the over the top loudness that she has.
<p></p>Also,  I do reccomend that anyone here should read fallout eqestria. It is dark,  and it does get downright depressing,  but there is a huge glimmer of hope that may tone down the darkness a little bit. Plus,  if you don't get the fallout refrences,  a little trip to the fallout wiki might fix that,  and this fic is more based on fallout 3 with a little bit of new vegas and fallout 1 thrown in for good measure. What else makes this story so great? Well,  you'll have to find that out for yourself. No spoilers for you.
<p></p>Also,  it might take untill chapter 9 untill it get's real good,  but trust me,  it's worth your time. And if you want to talk about it after you have read all the chapters out so far,  there is a thread on this very wiki that talks about the fanfic.
<p></p>One last thing. Karl,  are you sure you want to read SAM? Sure,  it's more gross and disgusting then scary,  but there are much better fanfics out there to read.

            If you're looking for a fanfic that's just dark,  you can try <em>Equestria: Total War</em>. I only just started reading it myself,  but it's turned out pretty good so far.
<p></p>I've found other conflict-focused fanfics that were good,  I can give you a list if you want...
<p></p>And what did I tell you about SAM?

            Dammit karl,  I thought I told you not to read SAM! Now I have to live with the fact that me asking qustions resulted in two more people reading that abomination! Fuck you man!
<p></p>Naw,  I'm just kidding karl. But since your looking for good fanfics to read,  I think I have one for you:
<p></p>I allready mentioned F:E,  but the next fanfic I think you should read is A precious rainbow. It's on fanfiction.net,  but you don't need an account to read it or it's sequals.
<p></p>"A precious rainbow" is an alternate ending to cupcakes,  where applejack finds RD being torutured by pinkie pie. she ends up killing pinkie pie when she attacks her {It's not a spoiler since it happens in the first chapter}. She manages to get RD to the hospitial in time to save her life,  but dash's wings have been cut off,  and now she can't fly ever again. Now dash has to deal with her trauma,  the loss of her friend,  and the loss of her wings.
<p></p>Now I can't explain everything,  but trust me,  It's MUCH better then it sound's,  and I think you might like it. Be warned that most of sequals {Which can be found by going to the authors profile} contain shipping,  and two of them are uh,  "Clopfics",  but don't let that ruin them for you. Also,  applejack is the other main charector of these stories. And their is a spin-off that I think you can find by going to the authors favorites page where it turns out bon-bon was one of pinkie's victims,  and now poor lyra has to find a way to get over her death.

            Wow,  a whole night went by with no posts...
<p></p>I'm pretty sure that I've mentioned this before,  but I think I should mention it again,  because I'm stuck: I'm writing fanfiction. It's more <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorEarth" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorEarth">Sailor Earth</a>-style OC fic (I'm not a Bad Enough Dude to write the Mane 6,  but I digress).
<p></p>So,  here's the setup: The story focuses around a trio ponies,  Peppercorn and Cinnamon Stick (they're <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfIdenticalTwins" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfIdenticalTwins">Half-Identical Twins</a>),  and their friend Darkly Brave,  a dark blue pegasus. According to my canon Peppercorn,  as his name implies,  runs a spice shop in Ponyville. His sister,  the overachiever,  half works with him and also works part time at Sugarcube Corner (it's not really that important,  it's more for the sake of namedropping. Peppercorn also has a crush on Rarity,  who makes a cameo appearance).
<p></p>Anywho,  Darkly Brave bursts onto the scene and excitedly tells the two that he found some sort of treasure chest in the Everfree Forest,  but he can't open it because it's locked and reasons that the twins,  who are unicorns,  could open it for him.
<p></p>So they all go to the Everfree Forest,  and after a short trip through some ruins (which I was originally going to state was the place where the Mane 6 defeated Nightmare Moon) thye find the chest. But they also find something else...
<p></p>They are followed by these small creatures from a friend of mine's tabletop game (Timewarp Vortex,  or Tw V for short). The creatures are called "Hoeppers" and they are kind of a mix between naked chickens and piranhas. I chose this particular creature because,  according to my friend,  they scare easily. That's important.
<p></p>So,  the ponies are chased through the forest by these Hoeppers and eventually Cinnamon Stick gets the idea to scare them away (maybe after running into Zacura) by pretending to be Nightmare Moon (whom I think the characters think of as "The Boogiemare." I haven't watched any of the episodes featuring Discord,  I'm just writing what I know).
<p></p>I'm stuck at the part where the ponies realize that the Hoeppers are possibly bad news and they're surrounded at the moment.

<p></p>Also karl,  I'm not one for sailor moon type stories {Yeah,  I know that the first 2 mlp fim episodes resembeld sailor moon} or stories that revolve entirely around OC's {Execpt F:E},  but if you ever write your fanfic,  I'll be sure to check it out. Where do you think you'll post it if you do write it?

            Aw thanks man! I appreciate your concern about me. I have a very horrible headache that sorta died down later,  but I know it'll come back. Why am I posting here while I'm sick? I can't fall asleep right now,  so I figured I might as well hang around this forum for a while.
<p></p>Also,  it turns out that I have a couple fanfic ideas as well,  but can't write them because A: I'm a terrible writer. B: I easily get writers block. C:If I try to write something,  I'll end up ripping off a movie or something,  And D:I can't write humor worth shit.
<p></p>One of my Ideas is a Horror/Comedy/Mystry fanfic Similar to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scream" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scream">Scream</a>. The Scream movies are among my favorite movies of all time,  and I'd like to see a mlp fim fanfic done in their style,  but For reasons I mentioned,  I don't think that'll happen unfortunely.
<p></p>Another idea of mine was to have a Zombie story. Basically,  it's your typical zombie movie set-up. Each of the mane 6 wake up to find ponyvile infested with zombies,  and millions dead or dying. The mane 6 and the CMC's manage to escape to a house in the everfree forest which they find is full of guns and other weapons. They also hear rumors on the radio {Which is being broadcasted by DJ-pon3} that Celestia and the government have turned against the rest of eqestria,  and that they supposedly have been killing other pony's regardless of wheather there infected or not. And that luna is holding up a resistance against both the zombies and Celestia. Now the mane 6 and the CMC's not only have to find a way to survive,  but also find out if these rumors are true or not. Oh,  and fluttershy manages to get a pet zombie by using her stare on it.

            Scream Idea:

You can never drink or do drugs.</span> <br>&lt;Crowd boos again,  and raises their salt licks&gt; <br><span class="purple">Twilight: No,  listen! It's a sin! It's an extension of number one.

            Holy crap,  you've actully watched the scream movies? Wow. I didn't really think there was much of anyone who likes both scream and mlp fim besides me.
<p></p>And thanks for the compliments on the zombie story. I don't think I'll write much of it because of certain reasons,  but if you want,  you can feel free to try and write it yourself as long as you give credit where credit is due. Who knows,  maybe I will work on it with you,  Like coming up with some of the ideas. Just a question though,  do you like shipping and do you like twillight and Rainbow dash? It would be a subplot and not the main focus of the story,  but I kinda want to put it in there.

            I loved the Scream movies (but I haven't seen 4),  if only for their campiness.  I also like the twist at the end of the first one.  The whole movie was very cool.
<p></p>I may take you up on writing the zombie story,  marston.  *gears turning*  I have <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingGoggles" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingGoggles">no problems with shipping</a>,  although I don't do it myself,  and therefore have no problems with TwiDash,  or whatever shippers call them.

            Well,  that just might work. I'll have to send a private message to you for more disscussion so that this thread doesn't turn into fanfic discussion more then it already has,  execpt I have no Idea how to check and see if I get any messages on my profile. Also,  I'm new to the whole writeing thing,  so you MIGHT have to come up with quite a bit of ideas to keep the fic going,  but I'll try to do my part as well. Also,  do you think you might post the story on your livejournal if we get it going or even finished?
<p></p>Plus,  I have school too,  so that might get in the way.
