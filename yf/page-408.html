            Did you guys see <a class="urllink" href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/amy-keating-rogers-response-to-derpy.html">the post<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on Equestria Daily from the writer of "The Last Roundup?" In it,  she gives quite a bit more info about the whole Derpy thing. It was a really kind thing for her to do in giving us this info,  and I hope it'll help dispel some of the lingering GRR RAR feelings.
<p></p>The fact that she has a disabled son named Soren who has a Wonderbolt named after him was doubly sweet.

            Seriously,  I remember when Derpy first got put in the episode,  and a bunch of people started complaining about how it didn't match up with their version of the character.  I mean,  the people who made the show went to a lot of trouble to do that for the fans,  and complaining that they got it wrong is just douchy.  It's like if somebody gave you your dream car and you started complaining that it was the wrong shade of blue.

            I know that when I saw the episode and not only heard Derpy's name but heard her speak,  I did a little happy dance.
<p></p>Her voice wasn't what I was expecting (and Tabitha admitting that she hadn't realized Derpy was a girl did a lot to explain that),  but it was incredibly kind and generous of the show to put in that reference to us. They showed that they know about us,  they care about us,  and they were willing to do something a little extra for us.
<p></p>That's a hell of a lot more than a lot of shows do,  especially ones with a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a> that may instead mock said outside audience. For fans to bitch and moan about Derpy's appearance showed a remarkable lack of graciousness and appreciation.

            Yeah. Much like the Sonic fanbase,  it's always the vocal minority that does the worst damage.

            I don't know. I think it started on Facebook.
<p></p>I found a link to the Derpy Day Declaration event on Facebook at EQD. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/02/derpy-hooves-day.html">Here is a link to the link.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> The page itself also lists some things you do on Derpy Day.
<p></p>However,  since it looks like I won't get any muffins today,  expect to find me buried under a pile of crates that fell out of a Pegasus cart.

            Anyone care to tell me why the first of March is Derpy Day?
<p></p>When her voiced scene first debuted on 21st of January,  a lot of people talked about declaring that date the annual Derpy Day. What special Derpy-related thing has happened on 3.1?
