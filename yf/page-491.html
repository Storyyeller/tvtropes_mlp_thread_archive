<p></p>Why was I not surprised to hear a sting from <em>Phantom of The Opera</em> in Fluttershy's fashion show segment in "Suited For Success"?
<p></p>Also,  I think I've found my favorite PMV. The one for "Beyond Her Tomb",  the remix of WoodenToaster's "Beyond Her Garden".

            I dunno about that...
<p></p>Seeing that he was dethroned (although last time,  we only saw him seize control of Ponyville) and imprisoned twice,  to me it looks unlikely that Discord would give up on his goal of conquest.
<p></p>Had a thought...Has there ever been a crossover between MLP and <em>Bionicle</em>?
<p></p>I lost track of the story sometime after the Visorak,  but I'm sure that the Mane Six could fit in with their old tagline,  "Six Heroes,  One Destiny."
<p></p>Also,  does anyone have an avatar with Fluttershy doing "The Stare"?

            Recently rewatched "Green Isn't Your Color".
<p></p>I noticed that both of Twilight's dresses were present,  both her old one and the one Rarity made for the Gala.
<p></p>I also happened to notice that the Gala outfit was on the rack of clothes Rarity intended to sell...
<p></p>"Unique design for a friend" indeed!

            Rarity probably eventually gave in to people asking her to sell them the same designs that pony celebrities were wearing.
<p></p>I have to say,  the "B.B.B.F.F." song is starting to grow on me,  although I count it as the only reason I don't want to watch the episode with my own little sister.

            If you're talking about the fashion show where Rarity showcased them to Hoity Toity,  then that would make sense.

            Rarity probably had some leftover duplicate dresses after selling some to Hoity Toity,  or she might have made a couple more to try and impress Photo Finish.

            I found a Pun Thread on /oat/.
<p></p><strong>OH BOY!</strong>
<p></p>There was also a thread that discussed the possibility a My Little Pony themed section of Universal Orlando (not sure if it was Orlando). Since Transformers had gotten a spot there,  they figured that it would be fair for MLP to get the same treatment. They also thought that other Hasbro franchises and Hub shows would get their own sections as well.
<p></p>I forget where the thread was,  though. I think it was on either /oat/ or the chat board.

            Recently got back to playing <em>X-Com: Enemy Unknown</em>. And once again,  I've started naming my soldiers after ponies (but not all of them,  mind you! I'm not a monster!). I've also named some after bronies. So far (according to my ever-spotty memory),  I have Shining Armor,  Lyra,  Fluttershy,  TheLivingTombstone,  Rainbow Dash...and I can't remember anyone else.
<p></p>Tombstone and SA are currently the squad leaders (sorry,  Dash,  but not this time),  and Fluttershy seems to be the best shot out of all of them.
<p></p>I have no idea what came over me when I decided to recruit Shining Armor into X-Com. Probably because I figured that the Captain of the Canterlot Royal Guard would be an invaluable asset to me. I know that I'll hate myself for doing this when he is eventually killed on a mission,  knowing that he'd leave behind a widowed Cadence and a grieving Twilight.
<p></p>But so far SA's doing fine. He's come close to death twice,  first from head injuries,  and then from a plasma bolt to the arm. But he still recovered,  thanks to our ever-resourceful medical teams.
<p></p>Oh,  and I also recruited Karl again. Sorry,  bro,  but you must put your life/undeath on the line once again.
