<p></p>Screw that.  If he's the final boss of something,  his berserk form looks like Neo Exdeath at the least,  and a turn for the Lovecraft at worst.

            @Kerrah: I don't know the exact quote,  but it is mentioned on the Sorting Algorithm of Evil entry on the third page of the trope list for the show.
<p></p>@Pykrete: Yeah,  that would make sense,  knowing Discord...But since his appearance looks more dragonlike to me,  it's all too easy for me to relate him to Ridley. Also,  Ridley had a penchant for death and destruction in the <em>Metroid</em> manga,  which could easily compare to how Discord takes pleasure in tormenting the Ponies. I could say that Ridley is what would happen if Discord became an omnicidal maniac.

            I survived reading through <em>My Little Dashie</em>! Although I was sort of emotionally prepared,  since I've experienced many heartrending moments,  I was still deeply moved. At the ending,  I didn't cry on the outside,  but on the inside I cried like Pinkie at the end of episode 2.
<p></p>Also,  I just now checked out the My Little Brony Wiki. I saw a December calender,  which had each day slot decorated with Cutie Marks. When I saw Luna's on the 21st,  I almost thought that the crescent moon was a Patapon.

            I may or may not be completely heartless,  but I frankly disliked My Little Dashie.

            Really? I find it to be on an upwards spiral. More or less. There are ebbs and flows,  of course,  but the world seems to be slowly improving to me,  all things considered.
<p></p>As an example: I am not entirely sure how many kilometers of distance there are between me and you,  but I'm pretty sure that they are a lot. And still,  we are communicating more or less instantaneously. And we do not even need a friendly dragon to burn our messages to send them back and forth.
<p></p>Just how awesome is that?
<p></p>One thing that I admire about Equestria,  however,  is the degree of fine control that the dominant species has on the environment â€” they directly maneuver the weather,  the seasons,  and so on. We will get to that eventually,  I believe,  but there still is much work to do.

            I'm a bit jarred by how the Ponies are responsible for managing the environment in its entirety. That would imply that the environment is incapable of supporting itself without their help.
<p></p>But I'm sure that Equestria worked on its own before the Ponies came,  if what I saw in Hearth's Warming Eve is to be believed. That would mean that something caused irreparable damage to the environment and the Ponies are the only things keeping it alive.

            @Ant: I've always theorized that the weather <em>does</em> take it's own course,  but the ponies constantly manipulate it to avoid natural disasters.  Like they manually spread the snowfall out over the course of the winter to avoid having a giant blizzard,  or they space the rain out to avoid flooding.  Things like that.

            @Kerrah: Well,  there are certainly signs pointing to a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan">Man Behind the Man</a>. The prophecy that foretold Nightmare Moon's return said that the stars would assist in her escape,  and sure enough,  four stars were seen encircling the moon shortly before she broke loose. And what about Discord? We know that Equestria was governed by the Ponies from the story in Hearth's Warming Eve. And what about Discord? A wicked being whose sole purpose is to cause disharmony and chaos? Okay,  I know that he did all of that <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>,  but destroying everything the Ponies hold dear sounds awfully suspicious...

            Okay,  so we know for sure that something was responsible for releasing Nightmare Moon,  and it is possible that the same being was responsible for causing Luna to become Nightmare Moon. Also,  this being might be connected to Discord somehow...

            I doubt that whatever corrupted Luna is more powerful than Discord.  Discord's a <em>god</em> after all.  If anything,  it would be more cunning or cruel,  but not likely more powerful.  Discord pulls the strings,  not the other way around.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">
<p></p>Here's what I think:
<p></p>Luna's anger/jealousy/[insert negative emotion] woke...we'll call it "Nemesis" for lack of a better name.  Nemesis found Luna and said,  "Hey,  I know of a way that you can become powerful enough to overthrow your sister and take the world for your very own, " because that's what villains do.  Luna said,  "Okay" because that's what sad,  jealous anti-villains do.  BAM!  Night Mare Moon.  BAM!  Night Mare Moon is banished to the moon by an Elements-wielding Celestia.  "All the better, " Nemesis thought.  "Let her sit on the moon and get <em>really</em> good and angry."  After 1000 years,  Nemesis sent a few stars to destroy the seal,  knowing that enough time had passed that Celestia would be "out of touch" with the Elements of Harmony.  How anypony knew this would happen (the prophesy) is anypony's guess.  Night Mare Moon came back,  and in a surprising turnaround,  6 ordinary ponies stripped Night Mare Moon of her power using the Elements of Harmony.  Luna was completely aware of what she had done during her time as Night Mare Moon,  but couldn't stop herself.  Nemesis' power was too strong.  Hence why she apologized when she was finally returned to normal.
<p></p>Nemesis sat back and watch as the sisters' former foe,  Discord was broken out of his seal,  but did nothing more.  Equestria was already doomed,  as far as he knew.  But what's this?  This <em>filly</em> and her <em>friends</em> used the power of the Elements of Harmony to re-seal Discord.  Weren't these the same ones who also defeated his precious Night Mare Moon?
<p></p>Also,  the <em>purple</em> one.  She commands great magics.  Not only that,  she posesses insecurities that rivaled Luna herself.  She could be useful.
<p></p>Or,  you know...what Ace of Scarabs said.
