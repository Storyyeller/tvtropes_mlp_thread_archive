            So,  I was watching The Find a Pet song (<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltyPleasure" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltyPleasure">it's my favorite song</a>) last night and something occurred to me:
<p></p>If Fluttershy were a little more <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a>,  she wouldn't have suggested the bunny,  the 'puddy-tat',  or the owl.
<p></p>But,  I won't hold it against her.

            That sounds good. They deserve to have some fun before the Great Destroyer manifests and devastates Equestria.
<p></p>Yes,  I do believe that there will be some sort of Great Destroyer. So far we've had villains that brought about Eternal Darkness and Eternal Chaos. The only thing I can think of that could top those two is Total Destruction.

            ^^It's comparing MLP villains to FF villains.
<p></p>I do not recognise to whom Nightmare moon is compared at all,  Discord = Kefka (the clown one) and the conclusion is that the third season would be analogue to Sephiroth.

            Yeah,  knowing only that he is an evil tree in armour makes him more similar to Psychoshy than NM <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16"> The only direction of that comparison I can see is setting Discord=Kefka and going for two neighbouring games.

            @Karl: Well,  if you think about the long-term,  Eternal Night would eventually kill off everything,  and there is also the issue of the land being overrun by evil. Still,  she vastly underestimated the Mane Six,  which eventually led to her defeat. Same thing happened to Discord,  but he had a good plan going,  unlike Nightmare Moon. The only problem was he didn't have a backup plan,  nor did he notice that his spell was broken before it was too late.
<p></p>That one really bugs me. It was kind of obvious that they were free from his spell. Yet somehow,  he overlooked it.

The first time he got stoned (heh),  he was defeated by not one,  but <em>two</em> goddesses.  <em>AND</em> they had The Elements of Harmony.  <strong>AND</strong> they were godesses. (I can't stress that enough)
<p></p>Now,  granted,  anyone who's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> would know that just because the Mane 6 are (for all intents and purposes) ordinary ponies,  they would still be able to use the Elements of Harmony to their full potential.  We've all played <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegendOfZelda" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretOfMana" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretOfMana">Secret of Mana</a>,  et al.
<p></p>I imagine that his line of reasoning was something like,  "Ooh,  lookit you pretty ponies with your shinies!  Don't you all look fabulous?  Such phenominal power in the hooves of 6 ordinary ponies,  Celestia must really be off her rocker after 1000 years (and let me tell you,  time has not been kind ot that one,  no sir!) Now now,  you be careful with them.  I'd hate for you to shoot your hoof off or something. *snicker*"

            I still hold to my fan theory of Discord being in cahoots with Celestia,  and the whole incident being some sort of test made up in order to get the Mane 6 to come to terms with their insecurities and unlock more of the power of the Elements.
<p></p>I mean,  for a being of primal chaos,  Discord was remarkably <em>un</em>destructive,  not to mention the bizarre way in which all the damage that he caused spontaneously reverted after his "defeat"...
<p></p>And how <em>lucky</em> was it that he got free <em>precisely</em> at a time in which six holders of the Elements existed in Equestria?
