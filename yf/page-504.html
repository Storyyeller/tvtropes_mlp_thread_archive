            Finally found more bronies on DDO! This time,  I struck gold!
<p></p>It happened on the Harbor General Chat. In the middle of a discussion,  I had mentioned Scootaloo in response to a message that mentioned chicken. Next thing I know,  about four or five bronies answer to me! There was even one that had started singing the My Little Pony theme song! However,  my younger brother was pissed off by the bronies coming out. He hates us so much,  yet he hasn't even tried to get to know the bronies.
<p></p>Whatever. Haters gonna hate.
<p></p>Also,  there are these weird guys on Omegle that have been spamming "You can't escape me" all over the place in Spy Mode. Lately,  I've responded to those by roleplaying as Rainbow Dash and imagining that the spammer is somepony who's trying to catch me.
<p></p>Now I feel like playing as Rainbow Dash in the Avatar Forum Thread RP. I've had a blast with Twilight,  but I think it's time I tried somepony new.

            Speaking of crazy,  I finally figured out where "Bring Me To Life,  an MLP Fanfiction by Tata Gilesbie" is going to go.
<p></p>File 13. *rimshot*
<p></p>But seriously,  I have to thank Jimmmyman for the initial inception.  He suggested that Discord stay comletely in character.
<p></p>Using the idea as my jumping off point,  I've decided that Discord "plays along" with the storyline for a while before getting bored and eventually getting the other characters to become more self-aware and revolting against Lavender-Whatever-The-Hell-I-Named-Her.

<p></p>-End Chapter-
<p></p>Discord snaked his way into the palace,  evading the gaurds in the most entertaining ways he knew how.  Before long,  he was in the throne room.
<p></p>Celestia glared at her nemesis.  "Discord...  How did you get in here?"
<p></p>"Oh,  some pony with a long and unweildly name released me so she could use me as a plot device."

            And soon they realize that they are not real,  but fictional. It would seem they're part of a bad fanfic written by an idiot,  but that's also not true. Perhaps far worse. They are in a <em>troll</em> fic parodying bad writing conventions,  written by a Brony! I do not know how they could possibly bear that knowledge.

            Eh...depends on how long it is.  The problem is if you try to shoehorn in something potentially interesting like that <em>after</em> the fact,  most of your audience will already have left after a couple thousand words of brain pain via obvious trollfic.  If you want to pull something like that off,  it'll have to be worked in very carefully from the start in a way that subtly signals that this isn't <em>quite</em> a trollfic and they really should keep reading.  Frankly,  I'm not sure how to even go about that.  Discord fucking around and playing along would be the more pragmatic approach.
