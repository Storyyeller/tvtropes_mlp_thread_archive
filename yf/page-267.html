            Question for anyone who is willing to answer: How did you get into the mlp fim craze?
<p></p>For me,  it all begain when I was going to vg cats to see if they had any updates. There was a comic on there that had the CMCS getting killed at the end of "Show stoppers",  and pinkie pie saying "There gone.... FOREVER!". Needless to say,  this confused the fuck out of me. I checked scotts {vgcats creator} blog he has on his website,  and he actully recemended MLP: FIM! I had left it at that untill I heard about that show being popular on the internet! This confused the hell out of me,  making ask things like "WTF? Why is everybody going all lovey for a stupid little girls show"!? Eventually I had enough,  and I decided to check an episode out. What episode did I happen to find? "Sonic rainboom". Needless to say,  My fucking jaw dropped to the floor. I HAD to check out more episodes,  so I watched other episodes,  and here I am now {BTW,  one of the places I kept hearing about the show from was this very site}.
<p></p>Sorry about that,  Just felt the need to tell my story somewhere. Also,  as you can see in my story,  I was a little bit of a judgemental asshole back then,  but mlp fim changed that a lot.

            I got in through TV tropes.

After reading over <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterThanItSounds" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterThanItSounds">Better Than It Sounds</a> for "Suited for Success, " I decided to give that episode a try. I did. I liked it. I decided to start from the beginning. I watched. I joined the herd.

            I saw a reviewer called CR make a five-second character thing for Pinkie Pie,  and really liked the animation of it. So I decided to check out the first episode when my roommates were away,  and found a great big,  stupid grin plastered on my face for 44 minutes as I watched the first two episodes. I then proceeded to voraciously consume every episode up until 16 (where the season was at the time) within a week,  and moved onto fora and fanfiction,  and whatnot.

            I must admit,  when it comes to ponies I am definitely in the closet.

            Well,  I have no monocles and I do not give guarantees about me being "very proper",  but the rest of the scenario is definitely possible.

<p></p>Well,  except that one time at that conference in Germany,  but I had a good reason for that: I had just returned at my hotel from a talk at the department,  and I had half an hour to spare,  <em>and the new episode had just got out</em>,  so I watched it while I still was in my suit and my good tie.

            I kept seeing pony avatars everywhere around here and noticed that the threads had a crapton of posts. So I decided to take a look. The first episode I watched was "Suited for Success."
<p></p>Everything fell into place from there. Now every scrap of paper in my backpack has a pony or three doodled onto it. I'll have to scan some in eventually.

<p></p>My original plan was to scan it in and color it digitally,  but alas,  my scanner had decided it hates me. So I slapped some color on with a combination of pencils and Sharpies and took a photo of it on my phone.
