            Maybe my trawling-fu isn't good enough,  but I haven't seen two incredibly easy meme crossover: Kate Beaton's Fat Pony and Nyan Cat. I mean,  if there's one ponified Fire Emblem floating around surely there is something of those two?

            And then I spent two hours writing this character for an MLP-themed D&D-like campaign:
<p></p><h1><strong><span>FINAL BOSS</span></strong></h1>
<p></p><strong>Name:</strong> Constella <br><strong>Race:</strong> Alicorn <br><strong>Sex:</strong> Female <br><strong>Description:</strong> Constella is grey,  almost like a storm cloud,  with a white,  starry mane.  It is constantly flowing,  much like her sisters’.  He eyes are very light yellow,  as she has gone blind from being in the darkest reaches of space. <br><strong>Cutie Mark:</strong> Four stars arranged around a crescent moon.
<p></p>After the time after Discord,  Constella,  the youngest of the three sisters (her elders being Celestia and Luna) and not even in line for the throne,  was tasked with moving the stars throughout the night sky.  Her favorite pastime was arranging the stars to make pictures and causing meteor showers.  Unlike her sister,  Luna,  she didn’t particularly mind not having the adoration of the citizens of Equestria; she was always more of a loner,  content to be by herself,  arranging the stars into pretty shapes.
<p></p>When the time of Night Mare Moon’s rebellion came,  Constella was beckoned by both of her sisters to choose a side.  She refused,  as she couldn’t go against either of her sisters’ wills.  Ironically,  this action caused her to lose favor with both of them.  When Night Mare Moon was finally banished to the moon by Celestia,  Constella feared reprisal from her eldest sister and exiled herself to the farthest reaches of space.  There,  she waited for a thousand years,  still arranging the stars (and slowly going mad).  Suddenly,  she felt something in her darkest corner of space.  Something <em>dark</em>.  Something <em>brooding</em>.  Something…<em>familiar</em>.  The seal around her sister’s prison was weakening.  She would once again be forced to choose a side.
<p></p>She took decisive action.  She could sense that her eldest sister could no longer wield the power of the Elements of Harmony and would be weak against the dark powers of Night Mare Moon.  She broke the weakened seal,  just as the prophesy written a thousand years ago foretold.
<p></p>After Night Mare Moon was released,  Constella stayed back and waited for the battle to end.  It did not end as she expected.  Six ordinary ponies managed to gain control of the Elements of Harmony and use it to strip Night Mare Moon of her power.  Surely believing that she would be punished for unleashing the destructive power of Night Mare Moon,  Constella laid low and waited for her inevitable punishment.
<p></p>But that punishment never came.
<p></p>In fact,  it seemed that her sisters had completely forgotten about her.
<p></p>Enraged,  she immediately set another plan into motion.  She would attempt to release her sisters’ old nemesis,  Discord himself!  It only took one year,  a drop in the bucket for one who is immortal,  but Discord’s seal was eventually broken.  By fillies,  no less.  Imagine Constella’s delight,  knowing that the world’s very end was to be brought about by children!
<p></p>But her celebration was short-lived,  as the bearers of the Elements of Harmony eventually once again sealed the God of Chaos’s power in stone.
<p></p>So,  she took action once more and stole the Elements for herself and corrupted them,  using her own will:
<p></p><em>The Element of Loyalty</em> – which she corrupted by her feeling of being betrayed by her sisters <br><em>The Element of Generosity</em> – which she corrupted with her greed and desire for the throne <br><em>The Element of Honesty</em> – which she corrupted with the lies that she told her sisters so she wouldn’t have to choose sides <br><em>The Element of Kindness</em> – which she corrupted with her desire to see the suffering of others <br><em>The Element of Laughter</em> – which she corrupted with her utter despair of being completely alone for a thousand years <br><em>The Element of Magic</em> – which she corrupted with her own desire for chaos and destruction

            Level Adjustment — the system that you use in D&D 3/3.5 in order to have races of very different powers as player characters.
<p></p>Basically,  if a race is LA n it means that a Level n character of this race corresponds to a level 0 character of a "basic race" like human or elf or what have you. So for example a Pixie,  who is a fairy with some spellcasting abilities (comparable to a basic unicorn's,  more or less) gets LA 4,  and this means that when making a Level 8 party,  if you want to play as a Pixie you should actually build a Level 4 character,  and not Level 8 as if you wanted to play as a human.

<p></p>How are you modeling the pony races? Going by what is shown in the show,  if earth ponies are LA 0 then unicorns should be LA 4 at least... </div>
<p></p>It's actually based off a game that my friend created called <em>Time Warp Vortex</em>.  It was created for the furry fandom,  but you can play as a human if you want (I'm currently in a campaign where I'm playing a Leporidae [rabbit]).  It's based around d100 rolls rather than d20.  Roll to hit,  roll to dodge,  roll for damage.  It's very simplified.
<p></p>His pony race is called "Equinis Faust".  He told me that he thought the Mane 6 would be a Challenge Rating (CR) of 10 (each).  Challenge Rating is determined by taking the total of all of their stats and dividing by 16,  then rounding down to the nearest whole number.
<p></p>The stats for Equinis Faust are as follows (direct from him):
<p></p>Species Traits: Un-Handed (no hands,  duh),  Equine Speed,  Natural Melee Attacks,  Aspect Producers,  Good Eye-Sight <br>+8 Strength <br>+12 Endurance <br>-6 Magic <br>-2 Willpower <br>+4 Speed <br>+4 Perception <br>-4 Knowledge <br>
These are the base stats for a level one Equinis Faust (Earth Pony,  CR 1).  When you want to make a stat check,  you roll a d100,  then add or subtract your base stat.  You increase your base stats by training.  You can do this every (in-game) day.
<p></p>There are Background options that allow you to change your base stats to fit a Unicorn or Pegasus,  as well.  "Aspect Producers" has to do with their Cutie Marks.  Their Cutie Mark is their "Aspect" or natural talent,  just like in the show (centered around a specific class,  of course).
<p></p>There is also a Background option to be a "Blank Flank".  But you're restricted in that you can only play an Adventurer class character (can do a little bit of everything,  but not exceptionally well at anything).  A campaign for a Blank Flank,  my friend surmises,  would revolve around that character trying to get their Cutie Mark.
<p></p>My fic,  <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7664942/1/Game_Night">Game Night<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is based around the rules for Time Warp Vortex (by the time Eight Star takes over,  that is).

            Thanks,  that sounds interesting.
<p></p>It makes the ponies incredibly strong if compared to a human being,  but that is probably appropriate in any case — after all,  they are <em>horses</em>.

            It's true.  Applejack has a Unique Skill that kills any foe,  regardless of HP if she makes a critical hit.  "Applebuck".  (My friend told me it's a little underpowered for her CR,  so just ignore the damage part).
<p></p><h2>Applejack</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Unique Skill</strong> - <strong>Applebuck</strong>: Roll <strong>Endurance</strong>.  On success,  Applejack delivers a kick that ignores Defense from Armor and Stuns Target for 1d4 rounds of combat while dealing 2d12+5 damage.  A Critical Hit Kills Target instantly regardless of Target's HP.  Failure deals 1d4 damage to Applejack and she loses her next action.
</li><li><strong>Desperation</strong> - <strong>Stampede</strong>: When HP&lt;20%,  Applejack Summons 2d10+6 cattle,  sheep,  or chickens (Roll 1d100 to determine the animal.  1-33 = Cattle,  34-66 = Sheep,  67-100 = Chickens).  All enemies receive damage according to the animal's normal damage * the number of animals.
</li></ul><p></p>"Desperation" isn't actually a game mechanic,  but he's thinking of adding it in somehow.
