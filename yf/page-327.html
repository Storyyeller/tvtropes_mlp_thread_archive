            I'm now gonna share my backstory for Discord from my story-in-planning.
<p></p>Discord was the grand general of the Nightmare armies,  and the right hoof of the Nightmare Emperor. His widespread campaign of terror and destruction made him infamous among Nightmares and Equestrians alike,  earning him the title "The Dread Lord Discord". With him leading their dark armies,  the Nightmares had won many decisive battles. However,  he had secretly desired to take the Nightmare throne and rule over the lands himself,  but he remained loyal to the Emperor until the time would be right.
<p></p>As a Nightmare,  Discord wielded destructive powers greater than that of any pony in that time. Discord could also shapeshift into any pony or other creature and mimic their speech and behavior perfectly,  making him the perfect spy.
<p></p>When the Pony Clans had driven the Nightmares to the brink of defeat,  Celestia,  Luna,  and the original bearers of The Elements of Harmony confronted Discord at the Nightmares' last remaining fortress. A brutal battle erupted,  but ultimately,  Discord was defeated. Because of the crimes he had committed against ponykind,  Celestia cursed him with the draconequus form he has today,  and stripped him of his powers. Ashamed by his failure,  Discord fled to a faraway land to plot his revenge.

<p></p>"An all-round goodie,  you're noble at heart and strict about following morals. Your intellect surpasses the common pony; you have a great eagerness to learn more and fill your mind with knowledge. While you can sometimes be labelled as a "smarty pants",  you always keep true to yourself and would much prefer to stay your brilliantly-brainy self than become someone you're not. A lot of people would consider you an excellent role model; not just because of your intelligence,  but because you're also so genuine and virtuous."
<p></p>I agree with that.

            Last minute entry to my backstory for Discord.
<p></p>After he went into hiding,  Discord watched helplessly as the Nightmares were banished to the Void. His thirst for power and revenge drove him insane,  turning him into a madman who loved nothing more than to see others suffer. He now desired to conquer Equestria to torment the ponies that had ruined him. Over the years,  he quietly restored himself and plotted his revenge,  eventually leading to his successful conquest of Equestria.
<p></p>The rest,  as they say,  is history.
