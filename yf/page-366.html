<p></p>Honestly the best Valentine's day I ever had was in college when me and the other single dudes in the dorm had "Singles Appreciation Day".  We played <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuitarHero" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a> and then went out for buffalo wings.  But yeah,  otherwise it's basically "FOREVER ALONE: THE HOLIDAY" for me.  I can count the number of actual dates I've had on one hand.

            I never got the point of bananas. Why do they even exist?
<p></p>They are basically flavorless. Now,  I heard that fresh bananas straight out of the tree are actually quite tasty — can be,  I wouldn't know that.
<p></p>But the ones you get from the supermarket are the sorriest excuse for a fruit I ever heard. Perhaps they are a bit like persimmons — excellent when fresh,  but utterly pathetic when plucked unripe and stored...

<p></p>Actually,  I've never had bananas off the <strike>tree</strike> stalk,  either so I wouldn't know what a <em>true</em> banana tastes like.
<p></p>They're pretty good in cereal.

            I dunno. It's not bad,  but it's a bit too sweet for my tastes.

            I also like oranges.  Pomegranates are also really good,  but they're too work intensive to eat very often.

<p></p>Somepony made a dub of the After-Birthday Party scene from Party of One in which Pinkie's "friends" were voiced by Personality Spheres from <em>Portal</em>. Mr. Turnip was the Curiosity/Anger Core,  Sir Lints-a-lot was the Space Core,  Rocky was Rick the Adventure Core,  and Madame LaFlour was the Fact Core.

            Yes,  fruits in chocolate,  or worse yet chocolate glaced fruits,  are just terrible. What's the point? "Fruity" and "chocolate sweet" are two completely different flavours that don't go well with each other.
