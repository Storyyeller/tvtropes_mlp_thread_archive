            I officially declare this a Dragon Thread again. Dragons and ponies (but mostly dragons) are now the topic.
<p></p>What gave Rarity the idea that she'd be able to get a share of Basil's hoard? It's common knowledge that dragons are very protective of their treasures. Maybe it's not common knowledge among Ponyvilleins.
<p></p>I must also note that there was a sword in that hoard.
<p></p>Souvenir from the Griffons/other place that has creatures with hands?
<p></p>@Carciofus: You have a point there...
<p></p>Well,  taking that into account,  that means that this thread would either be Cloudsdale or some other town (I'm thinking Fillydelphia). Since it's clear that not everypony here is a pegasus,  I'll have to say the latter.
<p></p>Sounds fitting. Fillydelphia: The City of Brotherly Friendship.

<p></p>In any case,  there seem to be some relationship between dragons and moustaches in the MLP mythos. The only civilized adult "dragon" that we know of was obviously fond of his moustache,  and Spike is also greatly interested in growing one.

<p></p>It's funny how dragons hoard treasure but also eat it. I mean,  most people I know don't sleep on a heap of pasta and grains...

            I think one of the reasons might be that it strengthens their scale hides (or is that from gems sticking to them?).
<p></p>Edit: Also,  if memory serves,  they only eat the gemstones,  not gold or other precious metals.
<p></p>Fun fact: I tried to find an answer for that question (that one above is just a guess) by searching "dragons eat gems" on Google. The third search result I got was Spike's page on the MLPFIM Wiki.

<p></p>As for "dragons eat gemstones",  I must say I only found this in MLP. The stereotypical western dragon's diet appears to mostly consist of nubile princesses <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            I have seen dragons eating gems before outside of MLP,  though it was only in a book about the study of dragons.
<p></p>Just looked at the latest Drawfriend on EQD. There were some good ones here. I liked the one with flaming-mane Celestia and the TOR pics with Bounty Hunter Fluttershy (Fluttershy in a Mandalorian battle suit like Jango and Boba Fett) and Jedi Consular Twilight.
<p></p><em>Pony Wars: The Lunar Republic</em>
<p></p>Had to say that! It just came to my mind and it just was so brilliant I had to say it!

I rolled dice (d100) to see who would win.  I added a bonus based on rank difference for the two contestants.
<p></p>Twilight Sparkle won the whole thing.
<p></p>1st Round she beat Granny Smith <br>2nd Round she beat Scootaloo <br>3rd Round she beat Rainbow Dash <br>4th Round she beat Cheerilee
<p></p>And in the Final...
<p></p>Snails (who defeated the <em>Manticore</em> to get to the Finals).

            Marston,  I took a bite out of an apple that had a rotten part one time and it was dark so I didn't notice it until "that taste" hit me. Ugggh. Never want rotten apple taste again.
