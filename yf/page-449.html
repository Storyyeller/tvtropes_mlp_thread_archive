<p></p>I decided to do some science earlier! Science with ponies,  of course.
<p></p>I saw this Youtube Poop that took three G1 MLP theme songs with all the nouns replaced with "PINGAS". At the end I thought,  "Hey,  this isn't half bad." (the songs)
<p></p>And then I had an idea.
<p></p>Everypony knows that G1 and G3 is generally taboo among bronies (<em>especially</em> G3,  the greedy bastard child of MLP),  to the point where it has a similar effect on bronies as deadly neurotoxin. But I believed that I could build a tolerance for at least G1,  and as my early experiences with FIM have proven,  the best way to build a tolerance to a deadly poison is exposure.
<p></p>So then I went ahead with my experiment,  code-named "Project Love and Tolerance". Phase 1 involved the minimal dose,  which was only small clips from G1. I used the G1 pilot intro,  the intro for <em>My Little Pony Tales</em>,  and the song "Sweet Music" (also from <em>Tales</em>). And amazingly,  not only did I survive,  but I acquired a taste for it! I especially liked "Sweet Music". The song just caught me off guard from how good it was. Bon-Bon in the MLPT intro was funny,  too. The very first thing she does is wake up and noms a...I dunno what it was. A biscuit?
<p></p>Bottom line: The experiment so far is a success. I might proceed to Phase 2 (full episodes) sometime later. I know that it sounds dangerous,  but I'm not afraid to go all in. Did Cave Johnson back down when he was faced with adversary? No sir! He bred an army of Mantis-Men and burned it down with combustible lemons! So I'm gonna do the same! <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a>!

<p></p>G1 (first cartoon at least) is somehow popular among Bronies,  because it interesting world,  antagonist or side character,  some of ponies could be really great (Wind Whistler is great now). I enjoyed that show,  and I watched it after becoming Brony.

            I wouldn't say a stealth fighter for Dash. She might like speed,  but given her competitive nature,  she'd want to be in the thick of the action,  so Interceptor for her. I would say stealth fighter for Rarity,  given how she's frequently paired with the Spy in Team Fortress 2. But since she's not too big on being in the thick of a firefight,  I think she'd prefer a position far from the frontlines.

            I don't know if anyone has said this yet,  but I just thought about it last night.
<p></p>The spell that imprisoned Discord was weakened because Celestia and Luna could no longer use the Elements of Harmony.  The spell was then broken when the Cutie Mark Crusaders fought in front of it.  Right?  Here's what I think:
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">The Cutie Mark Crusaders were not enough to break the spell on their own.  Their fight was merely the straw that broke the back of the spell,  so to speak.  In fact,  something occurred in the vicinity of the statue that was far more chaotic: The Grand Galloping Gala.  And,  as we all know,  Celestia invited the Mane 6 to the Gala,  hoping that they'd cause some trouble and make the Gala more "exciting".  Her plan worked better than expected.
<p></p><em>Celestia</em> is partially responsible for releasing Discord.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">

            How do you know it's the CMC's tussle that led to Discord's escaping his stone prison,  and not the other way around? Or for that matter,  that there's even a correlation in the first place?

            I don't think Discord's presence caused the fight. The CMC have been known to bicker and quarrel,  like in the infamous Scootachicken scene in Stare Master.

<p></p>Here's what I found.  Granted,  it's from the speculation page of the MLP wiki,  so take it as you will.  Emphasis is mine.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I think the reason Discord escaped from his stone imprisonment was because of the disharmony between Applebloom,  Sweetie Belle,  and Scootaloo in his presence. Disharmony may be what fuels his power,  and <strong>having disharmony nearby probably gave him enough power to escape.</strong> I don't believe it was ever said how Discord escaped: the seal that imprisoned him wasn't going to eventually break like it did with Nightmare Moon,  so this theory can fit. YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME! 19:43,  January 18,  2012 (UTC)
<p></p>Actually,  he escaped <strong>because the Elements of Harmony had switched hooves and the spell made by Luna and Celestia had slowly been deteriorating ever since Night Mare Moon's defeat.</strong> Although the CMC's fighting might've given him the final drops of "chaos-juice" to break free it was mostly because the elements had reset themselves to new wielders.

<p></p>In a sense,  my speculation pretty much matches theirs; it's just worded differently.
