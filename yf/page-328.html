            I dislike Dash. I find her and Pinkie to be very annoying characters and don't like episodes centered around them. Dash represents my favorite Element of Harmony,  but I just don't like her as a character. And Pinkie is just fucking annoying.

            She's just that stereotypical "Oh look at me I'm a free spirit who does wacky things!" character. All she needs to do is act like a normal per-er,  pony. She's too hyper and I find it nerve wracking. Emo!Pinkie isn't better because I have no problem with Pinkie being happy and goofy,  it's just that she needs to shut the fuck up.
<p></p>And clearly everyone else on the show thinks that too because they either roll their eyes when she talks or just ignore her.

            Right? Like I could say the same thing about Rarity,  but Rarity does have redeeming qualities. For example,  she and Applejack learned from each other that their way of thinking isn't the <em>only</em> way of thinking. She's had development.
<p></p>Pinkie's just there to make you laugh...and...she never does. I usually end up laughing at Spike or Twilight or AJ.
<p></p>My problem with Dash is that she's so cocky. I realize everyone has their flaws,  but her cockiness gets on my nerves. At least she's gotten better as the series has progressed.
<p></p>Pinkie hasn't.

            I like Rarity,  because she is one of the few diva snobs who has redeeming traits. Plus,  she's more like a dramatic artist than anything. She could act the same way as a painter.

            But pinkie and dash are awesome....
<p></p>Anyway,  the recently confirmed episode sounds intreasting. Dash ending up in a hospital because of something she most likely did {I love the charector,  but I'm not going to hide the fact that she can be a dumbass at times},  then finding out that she likes reading seems kinda intreasting to me,  especially since dash never seemed like the type that would ever read a book for any reason.

            And she <em>does</em> embody Generosity. She's snooty and can sometimes be insulting,  but she's quick to help people. When she's stuffing her friends into ridiculous outfits,  she's not saying "You look horrible,  wear this thing I made so I like you",  she's saying,  "Try this out,  I think it suits you well."
<p></p>And you're exactly right,  she's just a snooty artist. I think a lot of people think she's very pretentious and full of herself,  but I don't. I just think she's sort of bad at communicating how she feels. She comes off as an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen">Ice Queen</a> when she's genuinely not trying to be one.

            I haven't gotten to that episode yet,  but I do know about it from watching clips before I got into the show. And that's what I meant when I said I don't like Emo!Pinkie. Her joyful attitude isn't what bugs me,  it's the fact she's just so hyper that she gets on my nerves. I honestly think they could have toned her down a bit.
<p></p>Plus imo,  if anyone should be the hyper one,  it should be Dash,  especially  because she's so reckless.

            And that wouldn't be a problem if she were actually funny. She's just goofy. She's cute,  especially when she sings,  but she's so energetic. Ifshedidnttalklikethisallthetimeyouknowreallyfast- likeeverythingissaidwithherdyingbreaththenIwouldn- tmindit

            I dunno,  I personally find a good handful of her antics cute. But I can only speak for myself,  obviously.

            Her antics are cute(again,  her singing. "Bridle Gossip" is a perfect example of why I love Pinkie's singing) it's just...goddamn,  that energy. I just don't think it should be Pinkie who's so energetic. Dash is the reckless Pegasus pony. It seems like she should be the hyper one.

            I like pinkie pies antics. I can see how she could be seen as annoying by some people,  but she's not annoying to me {Odd thing is,  I once came across a few haters that were bashing pinkie pie,  and yet most of them had <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyStar" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyStar">Lucky star</a> avatars}.

            That is weird. I kinda see her similar to Konata. She is a bunch of traits piled on her,  without much logic or characterization.

            What? No,  I was saying I agree it's weird that people who complain about Pinkie are fans of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyStar" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a>. If you can tolerate that,  Pinkie's hyperactivity shouldn't be a problem.
