            Whenever someone writes time travel into a story that had no previous mention of it,  I fear they finally <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedTheShark" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedTheShark">Jumped the Shark</a>.  While it is possible this universe developed and invented time travel in the future,  <em>we the audience</em> don't know how much to believe in it because our universe has <em>not</em> invented it yet!  This is a fantasy world with a good amount of world-building,  so it will be a chore for this episode to convince me that this is a story idea that would work and isn't just a shoe-horn of a cool gimmick that won't be mentioned again.

            Yeah,  my biggest worry is that this is going to open up a lot of plot holes due to introducing <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> as something that's doable; the implications that the possibility allows are impossible to contain to one episode unless it's clear that it's a one time thing.
<p></p>Although I think this episode might not be too bad,  as 1. the spell is so obscure that Twilight didn't even know that it existed and 2. it appears to have such a brief time limit that it isn't all that useful in most cases.  Add in the fact that it's really hard to do or costs a lot for some reason and I think it won't cause too many problems.

            Shows tend to jump the shark when time travel becomes a recurring gimmick and it wasn't the point of the show in the first place.  An episode of weird in a show of weird isn't particularly worrisome.

            No,  the fourth wall is how Pinkie works.
<p></p>The time travel shenanigans had me worried,  but the new clip has me slightly relieved and optimistic. I'm not sure why,  in either case.

            This has got me curious now,  as I always am on things I can't find out. Did it involve rape or murder of one of the characters?

            No,  more obscure.  Aren't you only 17?  I'd feel kind of pervy telling you,  despite the fact that you seem to already have a dirties mind than me.

            The only thing I can think of worse than that is some form of pony canabalism. Am I getting closer?

            If you really want to know,  I was reading a 4chan thread by a guy saying he had a friend who was making pony videos and looking for constructive criticism.  I watched one of the videos he linked to,  which was only a live action Pinkie toy sitting on a table.  After a while of nothing happening I assumed it was going to be a screamer but thought "Meh,  I'm used to those." and kept watching in case it wasn't.  A few seconds later a guy walked on screen and did something with the Pinkie doll that will assure the video's deletion as soon as Youtube sees it.  Yes,  that's as much detail as I'm going into.

            If he did what I think he did,  that's a balance between messed up and kind of funny,  but I hope it gets deleted for the sake of sqeemish people and/or little kids not knowing what they're about to see. Sort of like the time in 5th grade I searched "redheads" for a school project and a bunch of naked redheaded girls came up.

            I don't see how that's funny at all and is several kinds of messed up.
<p></p>If it bugged you,  why didn't you report it yourself instead of waiting for Youtube to get around to it on its own? People can do that,  right?
