            I'd much rather be internet famous than real famous.

<p></p>Do you have a favorite Robin? </div>
<p></p><span class="blue">Not much.  I've just read bits and pieces in the Barnes and Noble whenever I'm there for a while.  I've read a bunch of the part before the reboot where Bruce was coming back from the dead and checking on all of his companions.  I've read some regular Damian/Grayson stories.  Some old stuff (I read/skimmed most of Knightfall).  A really cool,  really well drawn Christmas story about some flunky of the Joker's.  And since the reboot I've read the Batman and Robin Born to Kill story,  my brother got it for me for my birthday.  I also read Volume 1 of the League of Owls story in the new 52,  which I really liked.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Oh,  and some story about Pyg.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">My favorite Robin is Damian,  which I hear is a rather unpopular opinion.  I really like Grayson a lot,  but I never read anything that had him as Robin,  he's always been grown in all of the stories I've read.</span>

            I like Damien. I think he's funny and also adorable.
<p></p>I also like Stephanie,  but she loses a few points <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">cause she told me that Snape kills Dumbledore.</a>
<p></p>I haven't read too many <em>really</em> old stories with Dick as Robin in them,  but <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">I really like him</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nightwing" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nightwing">Nightwing</a>.
<p></p>You should read some more of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrantMorrisonsBatman" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrantMorrisonsBatman">Grant Morrison's Batman</a> stuff,  too. That actually might be a pretty good place to start getting caught up.
<p></p>Plus,  he wrote <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArkhamAsylumASeriousHouseOnSeriousEarth" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArkhamAsylumASeriousHouseOnSeriousEarth">Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth</a>. Got it from the library,  and it kind of blew my mind. Trying to find a copy,  but it's on back order EVERYWHERE.
<p></p>So you do that,  I'll do <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeStuck" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeStuck">that</a>,  and we'll meet back here.
<p></p>I'll be going,  then.

            For the record,  I'd rather read a liveblog than add another thread to my watchlist.  I have enough trouble remembering to check everything.  Also,  I haven't seen Primer,  but Homestuck gets pretty damn confusing; there are quite a few time loops and each universe has it's own separate timelines,  and you have characters from one universe who are able to contact those in the other universes at any point in their timelines,  etc.  The good news is that the author plays loose enough with it that most of the time you can just go "eh,  it's Weird Time Shit (official fandom term)" and not really think about it too hard.

            Well,  good news is that I have access to a better computer than mine when my mom's is being used. Bad news is that I can only open one tab,  the "V" key is bad,  and some webpages are broken,  meaning that I can't log into Fimfiction and continue to write my story. Oh,  and it's a netbook,  which means <em>much</em> smaller keyboard. At least it has sound.

            It's a hand-me-down from my dad's old job. They'd let me get a new computer if I had the money (I don't,  at least not enough for something that can decently run an online game). The only reason I got it out from storage was to try and run the DOS version of Megaman X on it,  which it could only load the first stage of.
<p></p>The reason why it's so slow might be because my mom tried to do a system restore after we got a Trojan Horse with an ad for antivirus software. She didn't have the equipment,  so we had to get a new disk.

            <em>Homestuck</em> liveblogging: There's a <em>Homestuck</em> thread in the It Just Awes Me subforum which has become an unofficial spot for people to post live reactions.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"><strong>storyyeller:</strong> How long does it take to read the whole thing anyway?
<p></p><strong>Bluespade:</strong> Depends on how fast you read it. Probably a couple months at least. </div>
By devoting every waking minute to reading <em>Homestuck</em> one weekend,  I was able to binge the entire thing in two days.
<p></p>That was near the end of Act 5. The material that's come out since then is about two additional hours of reading.
