            That depends on what definition of "weird" we're talking here.
<p></p>The weird I like is either the funny sort or the strange,  alien sort. I like the latter,  because I adore all things alien.

Most people don't have the avatar they're playing as their current avatar all the time. In fact,  many players play multiple characters at once making it impossible to have your current avatar be the character you're playing as you're playing multiple,  and can only have on avatar.

            I know that this is a Yack Fest thread,  and that it's more relaxed than a serious thread,  but could we please return to the subject of Poni?
<p></p>I wonder if the guy who made those X-Pony pics in those Drawfriends from about a month or two ago made any more X-Pony. Probably not,  since I guess it's because all he had to work with left were The Aliens,  and they'd be a bit tricky to ponify.
<p></p>And now,  I am desperately fighting the urge to picture a Chryssalid Pony. Those things are not meant to become ponies!

            I recently saw the previews for the DDO Underdark expansion.
<p></p>Upon viewing them,  I had contemplated on the idea of an MLP:FIM DLC for DDO. Since Hasbro is partly behind it,  granted only for a small part,  it could happen.
<p></p>I would like to think that the DLC would be come in when they decide to add mounts,  and it would include ze Ponies as mounts,  like in certain Skyrim mods.

<p></p>@Adannor: Well,  DDO is pretty toony itself. Most players commonly refer to their characters as toons (I was confused by this very much). It's not very likely to happen,  but it would still fit somewhat.

            @Karl: I believe there was an MMO indy called Equestria Online.
<p></p>@Toon explanation: Ah. Still new to this MMO thing.
<p></p>Okay,  so that idea's out the window and splattered on the ground.
<p></p>I wonder why we haven't seen the next installment of Mrponiator's epic series of fan animations? He's been good about consistently updating weekly,  so I'm a bit puzzled by the delay.
<p></p>Edit: The RP has taken quite a turn. It suddenly went from Twilight befriending Trixie to a reunion between my Twilight and Karl's alternate Twilight,  who is apparently from a Dystopian Equestria.

            I'm also looking forward to the release of Season 2 on Instant Queue. Season 1 has done me good,  but I've burned through it faster than a 2MPG engine's fuel reserves.
