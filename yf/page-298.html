            Rainbow Dash is probably my least favourite of the main cast. She's arrogant and obnoxious,  and doesn't seem to be getting any better.
<p></p>Two episodes in a row with her is kind of odd.

            I liked the new episode. Sure,  it was a little cliche,  and I wish the mare do well was a {{Spoiler: new charector}},  but it wasen't that bad. Plus,  I loved the spiderman and Batman:TAS shout-outs.
<p></p>I've noticed that ever since both the RD season 2 episodes aired,  RD has been getting alot of hate. I know she was a bitch in the last episode and a dumbass in the new one,  but I don't think she really deserves all hate she's been getting lately.
<p></p>And I mean no offense to any fans of the charector I'm about to mention,  but what is so great about applejack? I don't really see any kind of appeal to her Execpt when she interacts with rarity or dashie,  and I kinda think she's bland. Again,  no offense to anyone who likes her,  I just want someone to explain why she is so popular,  thats all.

            Well,  RD is certainly more <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">colourful</a> than Applejack. And I'd agree that Applejack,  yes,  is kinda uninteresting. However OTOH I do think of all ponies she has the best qualities - loyal (far more than the Element of Loyalty...),  dependable,  helpful,  caring (almost motherly to Fluttershy in Dragonshy),  practical etc. Also the enimity to Rarity,  that's a bonus<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue"> Plus,  she's usually the one who puts RD in her place.

Perhaps that's part of why I disliked the episode — I am not a fan of comic books and I never saw the shows you mention,  so I probably missed a lot of references.
<p></p>However,  I do not think that this alone explains it. The episode was really,  really dull to me if compared to any other one.

I don't dislike RD. She's not my favourite of the mane cast,  but she is an interesting character and the way in which she interacts with other elements of the cast is entertaining. In <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>,  I would find someone with RD's character very tiresome to deal with; but as a character in a children's show,  she works well.

            Heh. Some of my friends either are somewhat arrogant,  or were definitely arrogant and brash in earlier years,  so for me,  well,  that's something I can deal with pretty well.RD really turns it up to eleven sometimes,  but still,  I don't dislike her - but that's exactly the reason I want the focus to shift from her,  so that I won't end up disliking her<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>As for Applejack - another point is that she has many of RD's good qualities. She can be brash and competitive,  too,  but she always knows her limits. RD doesn't. Fall Weather Friends showed that direct comparison...

            I think Applejack's "mane" problem is that she's kinda the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades">Jack-of-All-Trades</a> for everyone else : She's a strong and loyal pony,  like RD. She's kind and motherly,  like Fluttershy. She's quite level-headed...like Twilight and Rarity !
<p></p>Aside from her Workaholic personnality and "farm/country girl" status,  she shares most of her qualities with another pony. But that would be really great to see her a bit more,  develops her personnality,  so she can shine in a new and exclusive domain.
<p></p>That said,  I don't really disliked this episode,  but was kinda disappointed that aside from the construction site,  I got <em>everything</em> right abour Mare-do-well identity at the second we saw her do anything.So...Well,  I would have liked a twist ("It's Luna having a bit of fun" or "Trixie is back. With wings !"),  but overall I liked it. Maybe the worst episode so far,  but still far above most children show.

<p></p>Also,  I'm glad to see no one raged at me for not likeing applejack. You all gave pretty good reasons for likeing her,  and while she is still my least favorite of the mane 6,  I think I like her a little more now.
<p></p>Do any of you see any of the mane 6 in yourself or anyone you know? I kinda remind myself of fluttershy,  since I tend to be pretty shy and I'm kinda awkward on this site sometimes.

            ^Yeah,  I suppose I shouldn't worry about that stuff.
<p></p>I don't why,  but I feel the need to say this: This fandom is the best fandom I've ever been in. Most fandoms tend to be broken and split,  as well as a little messed up {I use to be apart of the sonic fandom. Nuff' said}. But this fandom,  a fandom that likes a cartoon about colorful ponies,  is really nice and pleasent to be apart of. Sure,  there are creepers and overly defensive fanboys,  but they can be ignored. And while I've had to stop watching certain people online because they decided to be assholes to fans of this wonderful show,  I think leaving them is worth it just to be apart of this great fandom. You guys are fantastic,  Ya'know that?

            @Marston: Word of advice; if you want to continue with that impression of the fandom,  avoid Ponibooru.  Or at least avoid reading the comments.  And though I was fortunate enough not to see it implode first-hand,  you do have my sympathies for being a former member of the Sonic fandom.
<p></p>And man,  most of you are terrible at spelling "Twilight Sparkle."  Who is probably the pony to whom I'm most similar,  honestly.  Though she's better at being organized than I am.  It was an uncomfortable realization when I realized how much I recognized myself in her "Lesson Zero" breakdown.

<p></p>And I'm not sure why people would think Applejack is 'boring'. She's just sort of ... sturdy and dependable. Since when is dependability boring?
