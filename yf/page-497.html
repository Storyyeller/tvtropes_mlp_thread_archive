            Yes,  because the ruler who's most well known for going off the rails and trying to bring about eternal night,  and who still doesn't really have a grasp on the culture of the day is clearly the better option.  At least Celestia <em>did</em> something,  even if it didn't work.  That and the subjects at least like her and listen.  I get the feeling that swapping over to Luna would cause some issues.

            See,  that's the problem,  she was standing <em>right there</em>. While the wasp-zombie-thingie was monologuing to itself,  she could have wasily zapped the crap out of her.

<p></p>Or,  when discord was about. All she did was be all like "Girls,  Sheoggorath is on the loose. You fix it,  I'm too busy to do anything. Here's the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGuffin" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGuffin">McGuffins</a> of Harmony— Oh,  wait they're gone,  deary me. Go find them,  I'll be waiting here. Or something." and that's <em>it</em>.
<p></p>Though,  It's been forever since I've seen that episode,  so maybe there was an explanation or something? I can't remember well. Point is,  she sucks.

I really hope that the events with the changeling queen make everyone realize that Celestia is,  in fact,  a terrible,  terrible ruler.
<p></p>Seriously,  what kind of "Oh so powerful almost Physical Goddess" ruler let's the obvious villain monologue for almost 3 minutes before doing anything?
</div>
No,  see,  that was all part of the plan. Celestia could have obliterated the Changeling Queen at any moment,  and knew of all the scheme since the moment of its inception; but by allowing it to reach its conclusion,  she allowed Shining Armor and Cadence to take care of the problem themselves. Taking care personally of all problems is sloppy behaviour for a Physical Goddess,  and encourages over-reliance on the part of the subjects; much better to fake weakness and to see if they can solve the issue themselves,  while keeping an eye out for potential trouble.
<p></p>That's essentially the same reason why Luna made herself scarce,  by the way.

            By doing something else other than staying in her palace? I don't know,  helping the six get the elements back,  or something. I mean,  she then sends twilight the letters,  fine,  that's useful,  but for a character we're meant to believe that is borderline worshiped in its own universe,  it's really,  really little to do when she could at least try to zap the fucker with a solar blast or some shit.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> That's raesonable,  except that Canterlot was being Zerg Rushed by a horde of them. Even if it was her plan all along,  it didn't quite work well,  what with injuries,  property damage,  chaos on the streets... Not a really good plan.
<p></p>I mean,  I get it,  she shouldn't take care of all problems,  otherwise everyone would be over depending on her. But,  still,  look at what happened next.

            They didn't kill anyone,  yes. But no good ruler would put so much of their subjects in danger just to make a point. At least not the ones who flaunt themselves as "kind and loving and all powerful" and shit.
<p></p>Sure,  no one died,  but plenty of ponies could've been injured in that whole event. And houses destroyed,  places that need to be rebuilt and all. Same with discord,  under your theory,  in order to help 6 ponies get over their issues,  she let a literal madgod do as he pleased with everyone's minds,  the lands,  etc. That shit is traumatizing.

            I'm pretty sure the reason for the whole Discord thing was that she'd fought him before and knew that because he was a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a>,  the only thing that could beat him was the EOH.  If she was still attuned the elements herself she probably would have done it herself,  but that wasn't an option.
<p></p>As for the monologuing,  any <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> hero knows that if the villain starts listing all the elements of their plan,  you listen to it so it'll come back to bite them later.  It's not like Celestia would have been any more powerful if she had confronted Chrysalis before the monologue.  Taking a few minutes to take stock of the situation and weigh your options isn't exactly a stupid thing to do.

            I'm not sure that Discord was as mad as he presented himself. He talked it big,  but the worst that he came up with were chocolate rains,  strange scenery,  long-legged rabbits,  and unpredictable day/night patterns. That's hardly chaos and destruction.

            Depends. Is my president a powerful entity who is genuinely trying to do the best for everypony?

No,  no it really isn't. If the Princess goes around traumatizing people for the sake of some small elite,  then the Robespierrean way of dealing with royalty and nobility is called for!

            The EOH are not exclusive to them,  from what I could tell. Just the fact that they happen to have strong points in those attributes. If so is the case,  not only is she endangering everypony else in her little schemes,  she's showing favoritism. I mean,  I'd get it if she was actually trying to make them into better wielders of the elements,  which reminds me of Lord British and the Avatar (another horrendous ruler,  I might add),  but she doesn't really do anything at all,  in the end.
<p></p>My point: A good "oh so powerful" and crap ruler shouldn't be picking favorites or hoping that their protegés do everything for her. A good queen,  princess,  whatever,  would've at least <em>tried</em> to do crap other than sit around on her fat royal ass and hope for the best. Yes,  against chrysalis she was kind of acting up,  but any other time she was just hoping too much. Discord? Let him bring down havoc,  twist the minds of her subjects,  at least the important ones get character development,  right?
