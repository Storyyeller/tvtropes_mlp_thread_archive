Move on. I can't and won't hold up my life for someone I don't know,  who I'm not even 100% sure exists with the illness or condition that they supposedly have.
<p></p>When I've done my due diligence and confirmed the existence of the person in question,  only then can I offer my hard-earned money in support. Until then,  I'd rather not gamble.

<p></p>We know that there was quite a bit of time between the founding of Equestria and the arrival of Discord,  possibly decades or even centuries.
<p></p>What if the ponies of Equestria had forgotten about the dangers of hatred and begun to dismiss the Windigoes as a myth? What if the tensions between the three tribes did not entirely fade after Equestria's founding,  and only grew again when the threat of the Windigoes had seemed to have disappeared?
<p></p>My theory is this: Discord appeared in Equestria and caused trouble in order to prove to the ponies just how dangerous strife and chaos really are,  and force them to learn the true value of harmony.
<p></p>When Celestia and Luna became the first to realize the Magic of Friendship™,  Discord gifted them with the Elements of Harmony,  and allowed himself to be defeated.
<p></p>His appearance in "The Return of Harmony" was a way of testing the worth of the Mane 6 as the new bearers of the elements after their encounter with Nightmare Moon.

Except he isn't. John de Lancie himself said so in a panel (or something of that sort). It's the fans that make the Discord-Q connection.

            Unrelated note.
<p></p>I recently had a rather...unsettling thought. I was thinking about a ponyfied version of "DJO: I'm a Big Chocolate Slut" some time ago. When I got to the part where Riker (played by Rainbow Dash) asks Troi (played by Fluttershy) "Wanna go to the bathroom and french kiss?",  another part of my brain imagined a Stinger for the video,  in which Data (played by Pinkie Pie) finds them french kissing in said bathroom,  who then runs off screaming in terror.
<p></p>The reason it bugged me is because I like AppleDash better than FlutterDash,  but I don't actively ship anyone or anypony.

            I love it when the Avatar RP Thread creates scenarios where Parallel Universes collide. I find the Multiverse quite interesting,  especially since I've recently signed up as a Test Subject for Aperture's Perpetual Testing Initiative.

<p></p>And on another unrelated note.
<p></p>I <em>so</em> want to try the Gods &amp; Kings version of the Civ V Equestria Mod,  not to mention the New Lunar Republic and Changeling mods from the same modder. The NLR intrigues me since they have a <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoverTank" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoverTank">Hover Tank</a></em> for their Unique Unit,  and I'm a sucker for any vehicle that's a walker or a hovercraft. As for the Changelings...that's a maybe for now. Knowing the Changelings,  their specialty is most likely Espionage,  but I prefer the direct approach rather than underhanded Spy Tactics (except in Master of Orion,  where I use Spies to snag techs from other empires).

<p></p>I believe that there is some sort of strange arcane energy source that stimulates the growth of plant and animal life,  thus allowing Everfree to develop into a self-reliant environment. The source itself might be a crystal or some other substance that generates magical energy,  possibly of meteoric origin.

<p></p>According to TwV (tabletop RPG created by a friend of mine) lore,  the Everfree Forest was created when a Chaos mana crystal activated its "defense mode" to stop Discord from using it.

            Discord was inspired by Q but he is not Q expy.  As much I  like to see him as Q I admit its more fanon memetic fun that canon thing.
<p></p>Discrod is personification of Chaos and spread it for is own amusement. Q appear to be similar but (at least in TNG) he have hidden motives,  in most of his appearances he  try to guide Enterprise crew (especially Picard),  teach them something,  best example Tapestry (that one with Picard dying and going back in time).

<p></p>And as for the Changelings,  I haven't tried them yet,  but they get a guy who's good at attacking cities,  a free Courthouse for each captured city,  and 2 free spies (or maybe it's just 1.  I can't remember).  However,  they get extra unhappiness from population,  and extra happiness from the Courthouse,  so you'd better be waging war pretty much constantly.
