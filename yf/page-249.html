            Woah dude,  I watched batman beyond: return of the joker yesterday. Then I come to this thread to see if anyone posted,  and I see that video. Talk about strange.
<p></p>And about the whole me keeping this thread alive thing. I didn't mean to sound egotistical when I said that,  it's just that the thread seemed to be slowing down,  then I asked a few questions and the thread at least seemed to be going a little faster.
<p></p>Speaking of questions,  what does anyone think of my impossible episode idea I mentioned earlier,  and what would you do with it? {Sorry if I keep throwing that idea at you,  it's just that I'm kinda suprised no one already mentioned an idea similar to it. Plus it's the only thing remotely intreasting I've said on this thread lol}

            I think it might be better as a parody fic than an actual episode,  since it's targeted entirely at the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a>.
<p></p>I think it could be funny if trolls made an appearance on the show and just so happened to behave kind of like fandom trolls.  Or if the parasprites were used in a troll-related gag.  But I'd draw the line at "bronies" being actual characters within the show since that seems a bit self-indulgent.

            RE "Feeling Pinkie Keen" and "Over a Barrel":
<p></p>"Feeling Pinkie Keen": I suppose I should say right up front that I was one of those people who was kind of turned off by the message of this episode.  It's not like I hate it,  but it does kind of lessen my enjoyment of the episode.  I think it's more accurate to say that the episode can come off as "anti-rationalist, " rather than "pro-religious",  but there's a lot of overlap between conversations about rationalism and conversations about religion.  For the record,  I'm a scientist,  rationalist,  and pretty much a Secular Humanist,  though I am very interested in questions of the nature of reality,  existence,  etc.  I understand the appeal of orginzed religion,  but I think that in a perfect world,  we probably wouldn't have it,  at least as most of it exists today.  It might be more accurate to say I'm "anti-dogma" than "anti-religious" as I really like some aspects of organized religion,  such as the sense of community and belonging it provides,  and the fact that it moves people to think more deeply about how they're living their lives.  The parts I'm not so crazy about are the whole "belief without evidence" aspects.
<p></p>Returning from that (way too long) tangent,  my primary problem with the episode's message is that it's kind of blurry as to whether the message is "just because you (or anyone) can't explain something,  doesn't mean it can't be explained/isn't true" (with which I wholeheartedly agree),  and "just because something can't be explained,  doesn't mean it isn't true" (with which I very much disagree).  Honestly,  had that difference been made more clear,  I think I would've been a much bigger fan of the episode,  but as Lady Faust herself pointed out,  that's kind of a subtle distinction to make for a kids' show.  The fact that Twilight utterly gives up on finding an explanation for Pinkie's abilities (which clearly exist),  rather than accepting there's an explanation that she just doesn't understand yet frosts my shorts a bit,  but again,  making that distinction is probably asking too much of a 22-minute cartoon.
<p></p>I think the reason it hits a little close to home for some people is that discussions like "rationality vs. faith" are very visible and very important in society today,  and both sides seem to feel like they're marginalized in the discussion.  A lot of art,  especially that geared toward kids,  seems to take the "faith" side of things,  and I think a lot of people in the "rationality" camp were hopeful that FIM,  which has been very different (in good ways) from other cartoons,  would buck the trend,  and they were disappointed.  It's not like it ruins the series for me or anything,  but I do tend to enjoy it less than most other episodes,  despite recognizing that in terms of "objective" quality,  it's at least on par with the rest of FIM.
<p></p>"Over a Barrel": I can understand why people get antsy about this episode; it's cartoon-ifying one of the more distasteful aspects of the U.S.'s history.  But it seems to me that this is one of the points of art; we look at aspects of the world that we're not proud of and ask,  "how could we do better?"  And when we get that answer,  we hold that up as an example to our audience — in this case,  kids and internet-denizens prone to obsession over cartoons.
<p></p>Now as for MY least favorite episode,  that would be "Look Before You Sleep".  *Grumblegrumble* <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">Character Derailment</a> of <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwilightSparkle" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwilightSparkle">my favorite pony</a> *grumble*.

            I guess I'm kind of a rationalist of some sort,  but I was backlashing massively against atheism and Secular Humanism at the time when I watched "Feeling Pinkie Keen",  which probably affected my perception of it,  I'd imagine.  In fairness,  though,  Twilight's methodology in that episode isn't great,  so it needn't be interpreted as an attack on science or rationality so much as an attack on stubborn closed-mindedness.
<p></p>In defence of "Look Before You Sleep",  it had been established from the start that Twilight is fairly by-the-book (often literally) and that she's both new to having friends and enthusiastic about it.  Her "does this count as camping" line might strain credibility a little,  but at that point she's trying to salvage a sleep-over that's been badly derailed,  and turning to the book as the only available authority on the subject.  In any case,  everyone in the series does daft things from time to time,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">usually when it's funniest for them to do so</a>.

            Just One last thing about my idea before I shut up about it. The bronys don't have to be called bronys,  they could have a diffrent name. Also,  yes,  it would make a better fanfic then an episode,  but the controversy it would inspire is one of the reasons I said it was an impossible episode idea lol.
<p></p>Onto a diffrent topic,  it's about time someone posted the cupcakes horrorcore rap song. I think it's badass and darkly funny at the same time.
