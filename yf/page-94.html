<p></p>As far as I can tell,  we seem to have a habit of,  "allright class,  first impressions of the new episode? Any concerns brought up?",  and so discussion tends to last as long as it takes active participants to see the new episode,  unless it's <em>really</em> loaded,  or brings up an interesting world-building thought.

            Episode 25 was pretty amazing,  though.
<p></p>I would actually describe it as pretty emotional. Somehow,  somewhere in Pinkie Pie's heart,  I think she worried she was getting on the nerves of her friends the minute they left at that party.

            She does seem a little self-conscious about whether her friends are enjoying her parties even before they start making excuses not to go to the after-birthday party,  and she looked really sad when everyone left and she tried to get Twilight to stay awhile.
<p></p>On rewatching that episode,  I like how dumbfounded everypony looks during Pinky's singing telegram.

            well,  okay,  there are the <em>obvious</em> reasons,  yeah,  but I was thinking more along the lines of she's not so poular with her family anymore.
<p></p>although it's probably not that bad,  but I think it makes sense that pinkie is insecure about her friends. I mean,  really,  she says she knows <em>everybody</em> but given that she always hangs out with the mane cast,  she clearly wasn't that close friends with anyone. A lot of people know a person who throws great parties and stuff,  but they wouldn't hang out with outside of those parties,  she probably felt a little bit unnapreciated.

            When she said she knew everybody I don't think she meant she was friends with everybody,  just that she knew who was who in Ponyville. I though of her as the unofficial welcoming committee.
<p></p>I don't see any reason why she would be unpopular with her family,  they seemed to like her party. If anything she was the unsatisfied one. She already stated that living on a 'rock farm' was oppresive for her.

<p></p>I agree that she probably didn't have any real friends before the start of the series.  She's just as awkward in that field as Twilight.  Like in Green Isn't Your Color,  with her lose a friend's trust,  lose a friend,  FOREVER.  It feels like something she heard,  and is enforcing because she wants all the friends to stay together,  but doesn't really get that this particular situation could be resolved if Rarity and Fluttershy knew each others secrets.

            I wasn't really being serious about Pinkie falling out with her family; in all likelihood it's as everyone else has said,  there just wasn't anything for her there. Although,  I don't think it's impossible. Having a bit of fun is one thing,  but Pinkie's choice of lifestyle could easily clash with her parent's.
<p></p>All that said,  it is clear that,  for whatever reason,  she's extremely insecure about relationships,  and I think it is simply that she never had any <em>real</em> friends until Twilight showed up. And now,  I really,  really appreciate episode 25,  for making me think this hard about a character who I had previously found altogether forgettable. Now that she has her own personal neurosis,  she's moving up in my books!

            I thought it was interesting how traits of Pinkie that had previously seemed kind of cute and funny in "Griffon the Brush-Off" and "Green Isn't Your Color" became almost unnerving when she was seriously angry and insecure.  I mean,  think about it - she's actually a fairly dangerous person to lie to,  because she's very difficult to keep secrets from,  very difficult to avoid,  and prone to conclusion-jumping.  Fortunately,  she's also too sweet-natured to actually hurt anybody.
<p></p>I also thought it was interesting to see her portrayed as having limitations.  Previously I had thought of her as the kind of pony who would just bounce back happy no matter what life threw her way,  but that episode showed that she can become downright miserable when pushed too far.

            It's hard to imagine any of the other characters becoming that angry in the same situation. Well,  <em>maybe</em> Rainbow Dash,  but even then I'd doubt she'd reach that level of fury. Pinkie is just someone who has a lot of energy to channel into whatever she's doing or feeling at the moment.

            I would say that Pinkie Pie in that episode was a fairly good deconstruction of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">The Pollyanna</a> type of character. The only reason she seems happy all the time is because other ponies acknowledge her talents. But if deprived of that,  she has a mental breakdown. However,  she still retains the element of laughter,  it just becomes twisted into a sort of manic depressive defense mechanism. It was also interesting seeing the whole Pepe Le Pew gag being used for a more cynical reason and did a good job at showing how dangerous a pony like Pinkie Pie could be.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> Rainbow Dash would probably get very angry,  but being the embodiment of Loyalty would still keep her as their friend. It was actually a good thing that Rainbow Dash was the one who came to get Pinkie Pie for her surprise birthday party.

            I think dangerous is the wrong word. For how unstable and hostile she seemed,  she never looked like she was at the point where she'd consider harming anyone.

            I doubt she'd ever do it on <em>purpose</em>,  but it seems to me like she could very easily hurt someone without even realizing it. Heck,  she cartwheel-kicked someone because she was excited,  and she flattened dash's head - if not for cartoon physiology,  that would've seriously hurt.

            Did anyone ever notice how the lamp turned into a spotlight for Pinkie's interrupted soliloquy? That was a pretty damn brilliant use of props.
<p></p>Also,  this reminds me of how,  long ago,  someone without emotion asked me how a person would react to having the person who means everything in the world to them taken away. I postulated that a generally not-so-happy person would react with sadness,  while a more upbeat person would attempt to rage against whoever or whatever is responsible for their loss. A sad person would fall back into their depression without the thing keeping them smiling,  while someone with an energetic nature,  whose happiness is still quite bound to a certain person or thing,  would still have enough energy of their own to insist that they're not going to take that loss and at the very least want revenge.
<p></p>That sounded deeper in my head before I started typing it out.
<p></p>Oh man,  procrastinating on studying for an exam I have in a few hours.
<p></p>Edit: Also noteworthy that she didn't cry,  but after a brief moment of misty eyes,  just got depressed.

            I didn't meet him,  but we've known each other <em>on the internet!</em>

<p></p>And I guess he isn't <em>entirely</em> without emotion,  but would probably prefer to be and he said that when he admitted that I have a more developed emotional center,  it was actually an insult.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
