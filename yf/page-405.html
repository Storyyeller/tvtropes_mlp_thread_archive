            Apart from drawings,  how do you visualize them?
<p></p>As for me,  let's see:
<p></p><strong>Race:</strong> Earth Pony,  definitely. It suits me — I'm not really one for fancy abilities,  and I don't particularly need them either.
<p></p><strong>Color:</strong> Dunno. Perhaps green/brown,  or something like that. With a most glorious moustache,  of course.
<p></p><strong>Occupation:</strong> I'm happy with my lot in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>,  so more or less the same,  I think. Some sort of scholar or scholar-in-training. In my own discipline,  or the closest Equestrian equivalent. Gotta show all those unicorn ponies that they are not the only ones who can rock academic learning! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p><strong>Mark:</strong> I already mentioned this,  I think. One of the symbols for logical contradiction would work just fine — for example ※,  although I used to think it was too flashy,  or perhaps ↯ .
<p></p>What about you?
<p></p>This... this may be one of my silliest posts ever. If you find out my real name and want to blackmail me,  remember to bookmark it <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            @ Carciofus: Ok.  I'll do this,  too!  I'll just do that stats for my OC,  since he's pretty much like me anyway.
<p></p><strong>Name:</strong> Quillaim Bartholomew "Quill" Inkwell <br><strong>Race:</strong> Unicorn.  He needs to be able to handle a quill. <br><strong>Color:</strong> Dark tan.  A shade darker than khaki.  His mane is brown with a blonde streak and he has light brown eyes.  Faily average-looking as unicorns go. <br><strong>Occupation:</strong> Officially,  he's a Royal Scribe-in-Training.  Unofficially,  he performs odd jobs for the Princess. (In real life,  I'm a temp.  I think it suits me just fine) <br><strong>Mark:</strong> A quill standing in an inkwell.

            My ponysona...I'm still not sure what her name would be,  but I know her last name would be Scroll.
<p></p>Race: Unicorn for maximum quill drawing
<p></p>Appearance: Sky blue coat with a very pale blue muzzle and socks. Dark blue,  almost black mane and tail that are always tied back in a ponytail (yes,  the pun,  I know). Bit pudgy and of slightly taller than average height. Wears glasses because without them,  she's as blind as a mole. Oh,  and my avatar is slightly incorrect,  as she has dark brown eyes,  not blue ones.
<p></p>Occupation: Bookstore owner in Canterlot as well as a part-time sketch artist. Also wants to be a published author,  but that accursed writer's block keeps getting in the way.
<p></p>Cutie mark: A scroll with a quill pen writing runes on the parchment while ink lines flow from the nib around the rest of the mark,  symbolizing both her love of writing and art.

            Dunno where my ponysona would live. Not Canterlot,  probably. Some middle-to-biggish city.
<p></p>Oh,  and the other thing that one might want to consider (eh,  I'm bored today) might be how our ponisonas would interact with the cast,  if they by any chance knew them.
<p></p>As for my case:
<p></p><ul><li> <strong>Celestia:</strong> All Hail!
</li><li> <strong>Luna:</strong> I hope that we are not making a mistake by giving her a second chance. But Celestia says we should,  and I will trust her.
</li><li> <strong>Rarity:</strong> A bit frou-frou — ok,  a <em>lot</em> — but I respect her commitment to her craft. I buy my ties from her.
</li><li> <strong>Twilight:</strong> No fair! How come she gets to live in a library and I don't?
</li><li> <strong>Pinkie Pie:</strong> Fun to hang out with once in a while. I like her musical numbers.
</li><li> <strong>Applejack:</strong> I greatly admire her dedication to her family and her job. A pillar of the community,  definitely. And I like her apples. We don't really have much to talk about,  though.
</li><li> <strong>Fluttershy:</strong> Um. I can understand somepony's desire for privacy,  but this seems a bit much. Perhaps somepony should refer her to a psychologist? Still,  she seems happy her way,  and happier yet when she does not have to interact with random ponies. I suppose I should oblige her.
</li><li> <strong>Discord:</strong> That was intriguing. Unpleasant,  but intriguing nonetheless. What <em>is</em> a draconequus,  exactly?
</li></ul>EDIT:
<ul><li> <strong>Rainbow Dash:</strong> Oh,  right. A stuntpony or something.
