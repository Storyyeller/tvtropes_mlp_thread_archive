            I did not even know this was on Netflix until recently - sometime soon I think I'll attempt some sort of binge (I have seen the pilot and two or three random season 1 episodes) and talk about it here.

<p></p>Oh,  god,  not this crap again. Ever since that episode aired,  <em>no one is able to shut the fuck up about it</em>. The message was a bit more what <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> says. Maybe they just couldn't get it through. Never saw anything wrong with that episode. But,  of course,  people won't shut the fuck up about it.

            There's no smoke coming out of the smokestack,  so I guess they either ran out of fuel or the engine failed somewhere along the way. Since they were too far out to resupply (in the former case) or couldn't make a field repair (in the latter case),  the engineers had to pull the train to Appleoosa themselves.

I'm guessing the conductor merely pulled the train to Apploosa because it saved money on fuel since the entire area was flat desert.

            Anyway,  I find it very interesting to see that there are steam engines in Equestria. Steam engines imply an elaborate infrastructure of steel mills,  coal mines and whatnot,  which I... <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyPorn" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyPorn">kinda want to see</a>.

            For the record,  I don't think FPK was anti-science either.  The issue wasn't that Twilight was examining the Pinkie Sense,  it was that she was doing it for the sole purpose of proving Pinkie wrong.

            @Midnight: All I got from that episode was this: you shouldn't dismiss something <em>that very clearly</em> as untrue simply because you can't explain it. There are tons of things in this world we can't explain,  but we don't disbelieve in their existence just because of that. In fact,  science is all about taking something that exists but we don't understand and trying to analyze it. I never got the impression that this episode tells girls "never analyze anything,  ever". But that's just me,  probably.

            @Midnight: Yeah,  they phrased it really badly.  But still,  when you're only asking the questions because you're pushing an agenda,  that's a separate issue.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">This,  pretty much.  The episode as a whole was about not trying to say anything about analysis.  Twilight wasn't even trying to analyze the Pinkie Sense; she was trying to disprove it altogether.  Her approach wasn't "I don't understand this,  so I'm going to find out how it works",  it was "I <em>know</em> that Pinkie Sense doesn't really exist and I'm going to prove it".  The morale was probably supposed to be more that Twilight should have acknowledge that the Pinkie Sense was real (because it rather obviously was),  rather than explicitly disregarding something that she was a firsthand witness to.
