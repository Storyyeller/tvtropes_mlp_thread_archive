            Pretty much all the episodes are more or less self-contained,  though,  so you really wouldn't miss much if you decided to watch them out of order.

            Honestly,  if there's something that holds this show back more than anything,  it's that at the end of the day it's still My Little Pony.
<p></p>Sure,  the creative directors go out of their way to forge a new identity for this show,  but they've had some real difficulties in having to make it conform to the franchise's own history,  and a lot of the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> that bog it down (along with other kids' shows too) are because of the source material.

            I swear,  everything out there in my life someone out there thinks is embarrassing. Anime is too Western and supports white supremacy and the Japanese must be stopped and you should feel bad if you support it(I've heard many Asian American activists claim this). Anime is too Eastern and you're sill if you're not Japanese and you enjoy it. Or Anime is inferior trash and you have bad taste if you watch it instead of only Western animation. Or Western animation is all trash comparable to Fairly Oddparents,  and you should watch superior Nippon Anime. Same comparison can be brought to Video games in the East/West dichotomy. Or watching cartoons at all can get you considered childish. Or playing video games makes you childish. Listening to Martial Industrial,  Neofolk,  Extreme Metal,  and Skinhead music makes you a White Supremacist(despite the fact the latter originates in Jamaica). Childish if you like... skateboarding? A sport and physical exercise. You're a "liberal hipster jerk" if you like alternative rock. You're a geek if you study. You're an idiot if you don't. You're a loser if you're not having sex. You're a slut if you are. Is there ANY form of activity on the planet you can engage in without <em>some</em> form of stigma? Hardly.
<p></p>I,  for one,  am grateful I have found another piece of American animation I duly enjoy. To heck with what fools who think badly on watching it think. If someone wouldn't like me for being a My Little Pony fan,  their opinion doesn't matter at all. Everyone here already knows all to well that I care far too much what others think(aided by intrusive thoughts),  but if I let other people's opinions affect me up to this point,  I'd never have anything I like.
<p></p>Hmmmmmm,  since we're on the topic of memes,  amusingly knowyourmeme has the whole show listed as a meme. Oh what Richard Dawkins would say...

            In a hurry right now,  so skipping stuff,  but I have to say that this is a show that actually quite warrants intellectual discussion. It's by all means a very kiddy show,  yet a lot of grown-ups are fascinated by it. There's a lot to discuss about why that is so,  both on the level of grown men being escapist or ironic or any variety of other things,  and on the level of dissecting how you can write such a kiddy show and have it possess some class.

            As long as they don't try to use Rarity's escapades with the group's present they gave her as a metaphor for the problems with america's stance on war,  or use Twilight Sparkle's social awkwardness as an reference to the problem some highschool teens face with autism.

            Well,  in "Call of the Cutie",  it was pretty clearly about puberty. And Feeling Pinkie Keen was pretty entrenched in the issue of Skepticism and Scientific Inquiry versus Faith. Which is a pretty teetery matter and easy to say something wrong. I've come off to users here at this site as Anti-Skeptic and on the Romanticism side of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment">Romanticism Versus Enlightenment</a>. While I am on the Romanticism side,  I generally do no support any side of Romanticism which might support Anti-Skepticism. Many people are rightfully concerned about Faust's message in Feeling Pinkie Keen. I personally think it was a bad way of trying to get across the message of Romanticism which looked very apparently Anti-Skeptic and shouldn't have.
<p></p>And cartoons such as Tom &amp; Jerry did seem pretty morally relativistic. Through many points cartoons have shown a clear aversion to black and white morals. Often going from the perspective of "there is no right or wrong,  only the winner and loser,  the protagonist and others.
<p></p>In the end,  art reflects life,  and sometimes life reflects art.
