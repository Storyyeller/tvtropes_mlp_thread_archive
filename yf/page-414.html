            Calling Iron Will a "monster" was definitely a step too far. He was a motivational speaker,  not some sort of rampaging threat.

            I don't see it. Celestia was not particularly trollish during Lesson Zero — all she did was appearing and setting things right when it became apparent that Twilight had lost it.

            I dunno. From the point of view of the show,  it was a nice way of allowing for less Twilight-centric episodes; and in-story,  that could perhaps be interpreted as Celestia trying to turn Twilight's letter writing into yet another way of interacting with her friends,  instead of an excuse for isolating herself and falling back into her old ways.

<p></p>As for Iron Will,  yeah he kind of is a monster.  I mean his idea of motivational speaking is to teach to teach ponies to be short-fused assholes.  His first lesson was <em>onstage physical violence</em>.
<p></p>That's not self-confidence,  that's self-absorption.

            I don't know,  maybe I am interpreting him in too favorable a way; but I got the impression that he did not really expect anypony to take his "lessons" to the letter. It was theatrical exaggeration,  for the most part. Nopony hears "if somepony obstacles you,  push them down" and takes this literally — nopony except a total sociopath or,  as in Fluttershy's case,  somepony who does not really have much of a grasp about conflict scenarios in social interactions.
<p></p>Note that when he came for Fluttershy,  despite all his attitude,  he took care to knock politely on the door,  and he accepted reasonably quickly that Fluttershy had not been satisfied with the course.
<p></p>I don't particularly approve the sort of thing that Iron Will does,  or of the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> equivalent; but really,  all that he was trying to do was having the ponies feel like ruthless badasses — and afterwards,  most ponies would have had the common sense to realize that acting like entitled jerks in their usual lives would not really be that great an idea.

            He was also physically chucking Pinkie and Rarity off a short cliff.  I mean he <em>was</em> kind of doing his own schtick without that kind of self-reflection.

            They were pretty obviously attempting to keep him away from somepony who (he thought) owed him money. Now,  in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> that would be clearly unacceptable; but still,  he struck me more as a savvy and somewhat shady businessman (much like the Flim Flam brothers,  in a way) than as a monster.
<p></p>Who I really disliked,  instead,  were the ponies who were so outrageously rude to Fluttershy at the beginning. I can sincerely say that this is the first time I wished I could punch a pony in the face. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            This episode reminded me why I compared Fluttershy to my best friend when I first started watching the show.

            I'm pretty sure she does it in "Over a Barrel" as well.  Also the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndianaJones" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndianaJones">Indiana Jones</a> pics are awesome.  Epic Derpy is Epic.

            I loved this episode so very much. That's me. That's totally absolutely me. Fluttershy at the end of the episode,  the Fluttershy we know from Dragonshy and Look Before You Sleep,  the girl that would take no shit from anyone when it comes to her friends,  without being unpleasant about it... That was grownup,  older me. Though I still tend to relapse into older me if I'm not entirely sure the people in front of me <em>are</em> being assholes.
<p></p>Still,  Flutterbitch (personality was <em>almost</em> identical) must have felt oddly liberating. Those harsh words didn't just come from nowhere. As she showed in Art Of The Dress,  she notices and judges things in a rather caustic way,  she just keeps it deeply repressed.

            The thing is up till now,  "the Fluttershy we know and love" only acted on behalf of her friends.  This might actually be the first time she stood up for <em>herself</em>.

            Did anyone else notice that,  during the market scene,  we could see Lyra and Bon Bon sitting at a table with each other in the background? Also,  I think Derpy's saddlebags had a muffin button! Huzzah for little details!
