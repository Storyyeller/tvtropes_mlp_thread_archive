<p></p>Flanderization is when the writers of the show inflate the superficial parts of the personality of a character to the point where they're a caricature of their original self. This doesn't apply to Derpy because 1: she doesn't have a cannon personality to inflate in the first place,  2: the writers have done nothing with her character. The only actual cannon things we know about her is that she's a mail pony and sometimes has derpy eyes

            Feeling Pinkie Keen,  though it seems to be more of a delivery service?
<p></p>Anyway,  I think she was written into that part before fanon could get to her,  but it reached the team in time for them to derp her eyes.
<p></p>Also,  Ponychan is way too sensitive. They didn't all take well to my "What's the difference between little ponies and pound puppies?" joke,  and the thread got deleted.
