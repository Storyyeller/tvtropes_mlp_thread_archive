            I kind of figured that.
<p></p>But since I've learned to accept the harsh reality of death,  I took it quite well.

            I'm good. Thanks though.
<p></p>I've already more than enough sympathy from one of my friends on the Heap.
<p></p>But still,  thanks.
<p></p>Damn,  why can't I stop loving GLaDOS even after she basically gave the Mane Six the Discord treatment?
<p></p>She's just so wonderfully vicious that I can't help but smile,  even when she Hannibal Lectures the ponies into submission.

            This morning,  I recieved a rejection letter from a job I applied for a while back.  Needless to say,  I was bummed out.
<p></p>But,  <em>precicely</em> because this happened,  I got a friend of mine to agree to watch <em>Friendship is Magic</em> with me.

<p></p>While my friend is a complete anti-brony,  they're<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> I guess I'll just come right out and say it: She's a girl.  And my room mate.  It's complicated.</div></span> still a good friend.
<p></p>We're going to watch it sometime in the near future.  I'm thining of starting with <em>Green Isn't Your Color.</em>
<p></p>It all started when I told [Anti-Brony] about the rejection letter,  along with a few other friends (two bronies and two neutral parties),  via email.  At one point [Brony 1] said that he was going to draw some ponies during his lunch hour and [Anti-Brony] said "<span class="asscaps">*shakes head* you people and your "ponies". I'll give in and watch one. Pick a good one.</span>"
<p></p>[Brony] suggested "Green <strong>Is</strong> Your Color, " since it's his personal favorite.  I replied,  "Yes 'Green <strong>Isn't</strong> Your Color' would be a good one to start with."
<p></p>[Anti-Brony] replied,  "<span class="asscaps">Well now I have to see it cause [Brony] says green is your color and you say it isn't...the controversy! Coincidentally I am wearing green at the moment.</span>"

            Speaking of fanfiction,  I know I may be stirring up the proverbial pot of Hollywood shenanigans... (nobody will catch that reference) but what are your opinions on <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfAnotherPony" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfAnotherPony">Through the eyes?</a>
<p></p>I want to hear some LOGICAL,  THOUGHT OUT opinions.  Gush/hate if you want to,  but I just want to hear well thought out responses.  I've looked on the comments for EQD (OH MY GOOOOODDDD THIS IS THE GREATEST) and at most other places (Your fic sucks,  You suck,  and everyone who reads it sucks) and have found... no thought out responses.

            A OC Human In Equestria fic.
<p></p>Very base breaking,  but I've found Tropes to be a source of good logic in the past,  so I was asking them.
<p></p>If you don't care about it being bad(or possibly very good),  and just want some good ole escapism,  its worth a read.

            Okay.
<p></p>I thought it was pretty good.  But it was a pretty good HIE self insert,  and people <em>love</em> those.  Therefore,  while it was only pretty good,  it's now THE GREATEST THING to most people.

            I dunno. As far as <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInsertFic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInsertFic">Self Insert Fics</a> I've read go,  this is among the better ones; but still,  I do not think that the author writes conflict very well. The <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was,  frankly,  just boring and kind of pointless,  and the whole conflict part did not feel all that convincing.
<p></p>Plus,  to be honest,  I find the romance a tiny bit creepy. But I'm trying not to let that colour my judgment.
<p></p>But my tastes in fics are by no means universal. For example,  I found <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittleDashie" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittleDashie">My Little Dashie</a> underwhelming and,  frankly,  pretty awful; but I know that plenty of people greatly enjoyed it.

            I thought Through the Eyes got better over time myself.  Started out as wish fulfillment with the main character inexplicably having incredibly OP abilities right out of the gate but was saved by the writing being fun,  and started making more sense over time without losing the fun.  I dunno,  I guess I'm just okay with stories that can be serious and goofy at the same time.  Hell,  I survived Latias' Journey.  (Or it broke me.  I'm not sure.)
<p></p>Though yeah,  the romance is a little creepy.  Especially with the implications of the last chapter.
<p></p>My Little Dashie didn't do anything for me.  I've seen pigs with hands that were less hamfisted.  Good tragedy takes a degree of restraint.  It took everything that made Cupcakes stupid instead of scary and tried to use it for sad instead.
<p></p>On an unrelated note,  two days after winter officially ended,  Oregon is getting the shit snowed out of it harder than we've had all winter.  What the hell,  weather team.

        <div class="post-content">
            I've read <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThroughTheEyesOfAnotherPony" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThroughTheEyesOfAnotherPony">Through the Eyes of Another Pony</a></em>. I rather like it. Here are some thoughts:
<p></p>I really like the author's prose,  though his dialogue is a bit weird at times. He manages to be funny most of the time when it's required,  and <strong>HOLY FUCK</strong> was that mage duel in the newest chapter well-written. I've tried writing mage duels so many times,  and only gotten semi-content with them,  so I can tell how hard it is to get one this right. Most of the canon characters stay in-character,  except Fluttershy who's too naïve,  in my opinion. The OCs are mostly fun,  though I think there are too many of them,  when the author could instead use canon ponies as side characters.
<p></p>The mythology/backstory is really weird at times,  but I feel like it's starting to make sense as of the newest chapter. It's not quite there yet ("there" meaning "satisfyingly explained"),  but I'm cautiously optimistic. However,  the actual story of the now-and-here in the fic could use a lot of improvement. The timeline feels really flexible,  especially when things are happening in two places at once. Even given the explanation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this is someone's approximation of Equestria,  and not the real deal</span>,  the world feels really flat: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Evacuating the populations of Ponyville and Canterlot to Appleloosa is treated like all of Equestria is safe for now</span>.
<p></p>The characterisations are fairly interesting. Chapter 14 (yes,  I mention that chapter every paragraph,  though mostly because it's most fresh in my mind) is a really good example of the author's skill. The first half is building up these characters,  showing what makes them tick,  and the second half ignites a conflict where all their various traits come to play.
<p></p>One of my main problems is that at times the story seems to ignore very prominent questions to try to keep its pace. The implications of <em>FIM</em> existing as a fictional show on Earth are never brought up until... what,  chapter 12? I mean,  I can understand Firewall not telling anyone that "either someone on my world knows about this world and totally ripped it off,  or something fishy is going on...",  <em>BUT</em> he never wonders about that in his mind either. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And Luna doesn't bring it up either after absorbing the collected knowledge of all humankind,  including everything about the history of the <em>My Little Pony</em> franchise.</span>
<p></p>I think it's definitely worth a read,  if you've got the patience and time. It's probably the best <em>FIM</em> fic I've read (assuming you don't count <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendshipIsWitchcraft" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendshipIsWitchcraft">audio-visual entertainment</a> as "fiction"),  but it's also the only long <em>FIM</em> fic I've read. I tend to focus on short reads that only last a chapter or two.

            Still nowhere near Fallout Equestria for me.  That's basically on my list of favorite written works ever,  fanfiction or not,  and I feel really stupid for having put off reading it as long as I did.  If anyone decides to read it,  I'd advise staying away from our trope page for it to keep spoilers fresh,  because it's well worth it.
<p></p>I'm okay with Firewall being stupidly powerful during the mage duel since by that point his OP-ness came from somewhere specific.
