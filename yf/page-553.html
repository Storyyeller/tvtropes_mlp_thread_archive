            Well,  I had an awesome birthday. Kid Icarus Uprising's solo campaign is <strong>SWEET AWESOME</strong> so far (I'm on the sixth chapter),  and the multiplayer reminds me of TF2 in a lot of ways,  which I like. The other 3DS features are pretty cool as well. I also got a German chocolate cake (was ein orgasmus gebäck das war!).
<p></p>Anyway,  on the topic of drawing suggestions for Mousa,  how about a human!pony playing a fitting instrument for their personality?

            The dialogue reminds me of action-adventure cartoons,  like the Ben 10 series,  mixed with Shonen anime. Gameplay makes my right arm hurt,  and the camera occasionally screws up,  but otherwise,  it's amazing. Palutena,  Pandora,  and Mangus are my favorite characters.
<p></p>Also,  thanks ATC!

            If you look at the quotes page,  it's basically a transcription of the entire game. That shows you have awesome the dialogue is.
<p></p>Magnus is pretty awesome. I hope he gets added to the next Brawl.

            A lot of people seemed pretty apathetic towards Pit when he was added to Brawl,  but since his game was such a massive success,  hopefully we'll get at least 1 more character from his franchise.

            I think the problem was that in Brawl he didn't have as much of an established characterization so there wasn't as much reason to get excited.  Now that he has a defined voice,  he's a lot more interesting.  But yeah,  Magnus in Brawl (or whatever the next game is) would be awesome.

            The reason Kid Icarus got a game is because Nintendo was making a game with a similar format (flight stage,  and then land stage),  but I wonder what made them pick Pit over someone like Star Fox.

If the main audience for the Star Fox series is kids,  then they'd be more likely to pick it up if the saw "The Space Fox from Super Smash Bros/The Star Fox 64 characters". However,  older audiences would be more welcoming to a new IP,  provided that it got enough advertising.

Yes,   both Generation 1 and Generation 3 had a Moondancer,   though they looked very different.  You can bet that any time Friendship Is Magic brings up a Generation 1 pony name verbatim like that,   it's because the name had already been recycled into Generation 3,   so they'd kept the trademark up.
<p></p>So on the flip side,   Gen 3 didn't have a Cherries Jubilee,   which may be why "The Last Roundup" called her "Cherry Jubilee" instead.
