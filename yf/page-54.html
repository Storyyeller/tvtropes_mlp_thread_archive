            I have to admit,  I haven't been around,  watching the show and talking about it lately,  due to fixation and worry and depression over the Japanese earthquakes right now.
<p></p>If anyone has been wondering why I've been largely absent lately. I probably won't be back to watching the show or being a part of the fandom anytime soon again,  either.

            Well she doesn't seem to have any problems. Rarity can be stuck-up and seems to have OCD,  Rainbow is a braggart and doesn't always think things through (granted,  she's aware of this),  and Twilight is still learning social skills.
<p></p>Pinkie certainly has social skills,  knows how far she can take a joke on her friends,  has long since learned how to cope with fear,  doesn't seem to have any disorders (I don't think her hyperacticity has been disabilitating,  but I haven't seen all the episodes yet),  and in general shows uprights behavior.

            At least early on,  though,  she shows a disregard for Twilight's personal space (though this is probably justified in that they were very opposite: Pinkie was/is a hardcore extrovert,  Twilight was just getting used to being social).

            She's also been shown to be very,  veeeery poor at communication,  such as in 'Swarm of the Century',  where simply telling people that polka music was the Parapsrite's weakness,  she simply assumed everyone knew and was arbitrarily being difficult. At the beginning of 'Griffon the brush off',  when she's trying to get Dash's attention she fails at communication as well (It was for a joke,  admittedly,  but that's no excuse).
<p></p>If her behavior in 'Green isn't your colour' is consistent as well,  she shows a Rorschach-level inability to compromise.
<p></p>Altogether,  I don't think would be too far off if they were to accuse her of not taking other Ponies feelings into account,  contrary as that seems.

            I think that last point is taking it a bit far. Inability to see from another's perspective isn't the same as a lack of concern.

            No,  I see what your getting at. I hadn't meant to imply that she lacks any sort of concern for others feelings,  though I can see how one could take that away.
<p></p>No,  what I meant is that,  despite her concern for other Ponies,  their point of view,  or that they might even have a point of view differing from hers,  doesn't ever occur to her. Case in point,  her introduction to Twilight: She may have not known the degree to which Twilight was antisocial,  their initial meeting made it clear that Twilight had some difficulties making friends. Her response? Invite every pony in town to Twilights house.
<p></p>She means well,  it simply doesn't occur to her that her way is not always the right way.

            I thought it was a welcoming party.
<p></p>I actually got this idea when I saw someone saw that Pinkie Pie was the least developed character of the main six. Then in another thread they were taking about Evangelion and how the least developed characters were the ones without issues. It never seemed to be that Pinkie had an obvious vice or disability,  and thus she didn't have much to overcome or learn.
<p></p>This left her as the underdeveloped pony of the group and I wondered if that was a bad thing. I still like her,  despite not having any personal growth. So I thought maybe most of her development already happened,  she's already oversome most of her problems before the series began.

            It was a welcoming party,  just a misguided one.
<p></p>I tend to think that Pinkie is the least developed because she's intended to be a comedic relief character,  so it takes away from somewhat that if she goes through development. Which is not to say that comedic characters are immune to development,  or even that Pinkie couldn't conceivably be developed,  it's just that her particular brand of humor relies or her just being...THERE,  not necessarily involved in any serious way. We've had,  what,  ONE episode that really focused on Pinkie in any capacity?
