            I know this is a sensitive issue,  but is it wrong fro me to be bothered about how much of a magical negro character Zecora is turning into?  She basically only appears to dispense wisdom and help the ponies with her potions,  and then immediately disappears back into the Everfree Forest.  It kind of disappoints me,  because Zecora is a really interesting character who hardly gets any attention from the show.

            I brought it up because it was especially bad in this episode,  and is starting to become a common occurance,  since pretty much the exact same thing happened in the Cutie Pox,  whatever the parasprite episode was called,  and even the episode where she was first introduced.  The only episode where she got any attention as a character and not just a means to an end was in Nightmare Night,  and even then she spent most of the episode in the background.

            Err,  I am actually glad that Zecora became a recurring character,  and competent one as that. That her expertise is needed and sought after shows that she becomes integrated in the community.
<p></p>Besides,  it's not like background characters have anything but "functions" to begin with. I mean,  is mayor exists for anything but to say a few well-meaning but utterly futile "official" lines in every few episodes?

            To me,  it seems like she's a plot device,  so they use her. She knows a lot. Thus,  she is useful for things that would make no sense for the ponies to know.

            ^That Basically sums up zecora right there. Not that she's a bad charector or anything,  but she is basically a plot device. Execpt in swarm of the centuary,  where even she didn't know what to do.

            Loved the episode.  Absolutely loved it.  Totally made up for everything I had against the last two,  and some of the gags were freaking classic <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin">
<p></p>As for Zecora,  she does fill the niche of "scholar of the outlandish" quite well,  but I wish she'd guest-star in the main adventuring party at least once.

            I think the format they've got laid out is vaguely something like a two-parter to kick off the season,  two episodes for each of the mane cast,  two holiday episodes,  four miscellaneous episodes,  and one to finish the season off.  But I could be totally wrong.

            Now that I think about it,  Zecora deserves her own episode. One where she's just hanging out with the Mane cast.
