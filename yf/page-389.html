            Yeah,  I gotta say "you can't be friends with everyone" wouldn't work.  I mean the whole point of the show is that barring outright evil (and sometimes even then) you kinda can.
<p></p>Pinkie's usual solution to problems is to just be <em>more Pinkie</em> at them until something gives (usually the fabric of space and time),  and that made it worse.  She won when she backed off long enough to do something more thoughtful.

If it weren't for that bit of brilliant insight,  I honestly would think Cranky would have not only hated her guts but also be slightly AFRAID of the Pink pony.

Eh,  not really a downer. I mean,  it's <em>okay</em> not to be friends with everybody. Some people just aren't really compatible; that's life and okay. But I guess,  while that's true,  it maybe wouldn't really fit into MLP.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">And she was stalking him because she could clearly see how miserable he was.</div>
Still not okay. As far as I'm concerned,  privacy is absolutely sacrosanct. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue"> And besides,  as was said,  Pinkie <em>did</em> really screw up with all that,  but then just happened to be lucky.

            Yeah,  I think the main issue with Pinkie is that she couldn't comprehend that she was the reason he was unhappy,  and thus she didn't realize that the proper course of action was to leave him alone.

            Well,  except she wasn't the reason he was unhappy,  not at first.  The guy had issues he really needed to get off his chest,  whether or not Matilda showed up at the end.
<p></p>Personally,  I would rather have seen Pinkie get him to open up by listening instead of talking.  Like,  some time after he cools down from Pinkie accidentally destroying his album,  she could ask him to tell his story to her — she owes it to him to make sure it never gets forgotten no matter what.  I would also have rather seen it end with Ponyville taking him in and <a class="urllink" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WseZZWlkYQs/TtBcHtfh9LI/AAAAAAAABw0/uzQ1hmXlnbI/s1600/gummysweetthing.png">Pinkie P.Ie.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small> promising to help him track Matilda down afterward,  complete with trenchcoat and hammy noir monologues.
<p></p>I dunno,  I just feel like cartoons get shoehorned into Perfect End really often,  and not enough Good End.  The latter sometimes gives a lot more room to show character depth,  going and growing as far as they can instead of having everything fall into place for a convenient stopping point.  Also leaves a small loose thread for future continuity,  like in a future episode we go into the library and Twilight is helping Pinkie track down public records — just a quick side glance,  like Dash reading Daring Do in the corner was for this one.

            To be honest,  I don't really think badly of Pinkie Pie in this episode. She had good intentions at heart,  she just wasn't too bright in carrying them out {Telling the whole town that Cranky's bald,  for one example}. Everypony has their flaws,  and Pinkie Pie is no exception.

            Yeah,  I don't cut loose very often,  but sometimes it's fun.  I was a groomsman at one of my friend's wedding this summer,  and the reception was epic.
<p></p>Anyway,  I wrote <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkfUcu8hNCk&amp;feature=feedu">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> a while back and I was wondering if it's worth my time to get back to work on it.  In summary,  Cheerilee's class puts on a play depicting the events of the second season opener,  and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">it's terrible</a>.
