            I'm thinking they arrived shortly after the leaders defeated the Windigoes with the power of <strong>KINGDOM HEEEAAAARTS!</strong>
<p></p>But given the circumstances,  there's no doubt that a good portion of the refugees from the three tribes had died along the way.
<p></p>But I'm not saying that they were left for dead by their leaders!

            I think it's simpler to say that the stage couldn't exactly hold several hundred ponies at once,  so they had to make do with two actors each.

            That makes sense too. One stage cannot hold the combined populations of the Three Pony Clans.
<p></p>Had an idea for the Donkeys in Equestria. I imagined that they are mostly comprised of merchants and traders or something like that,  and that they are very skilled when it comes to running businesses and trade.
<p></p>Yeah...I might have been thinking about <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfOrion" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfOrion">The Gnolams</a> at the time.

            I just recently remembered that there are Changelings in Starcraft II. Had a thought.
<p></p>Thought Transcription
<p></p>&gt;Zerg have Changelings
<p></p>&gt;Changelings shapeshift into Marines and Zealots
<p></p>&gt;Changelings show up in Season Finale
<p></p>&gt;Shapeshift into ponies and feed on love
<p></p>&gt;Changeling Ponies are somehow derived from/related to Zerg Changelings
<p></p>&gt;CONCLUSION: The Changelings are Zerg.
<p></p>Really,  when I had seen them,  The Zerg were the first thing to come to mind,  so it wasn't too hard for me to connect the dots.
<p></p>The only problem is that Zerg Changelings are completely harmless.

            They are the original Changelings and the Swarm has only hijacked one of Chrysalis's subjects,  of course.

            Balderdash! Only the Zerg could engineer such a devious creature.
<p></p>The first Zerg Changelings were merely an experiment,  which failed apparently. The Zerg Pony Changelings were devised by a small independent team within the Swarm,  based on the original Changelings and Infested Ponies. Not so sure on details.
<p></p>This might actually be possible,  since the Zerg Changelings predate the Pony Changelings by a margin of roughly two years.

            I don't have a problem with the musical numbers...save for the title. Like many others,  it's still a little grating to hear even now.
<p></p>Rarity's are the best IMO. She has an amazing voice. Not to mention Cadence's aria in the finale.
<p></p>I'm guessing you're new here,  so let me be the first to say "Welcome to the Herd!"
<p></p>Many of us went through that stage in our early days,  take it from me. It will pass in time.
<p></p>I want to get another pet in DDO,  but I can't afford to buy one from from the DDO Store or the Auction House. At the very least,  I want to get that fancy-pants Top Hat for Scootaloo (my pet robot). Can't afford that one either,  so maybe I'll steal one from Pinkie Pie...
