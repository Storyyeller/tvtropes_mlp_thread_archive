            I think the problem is that they're the <em>mane 6</em>. As in,  they're introduced as the six focal characters right off the bat. So there's an expectation for them to be well-rounded and fully-developed characters sooner rather than later.

            RP UPDATE!
<p></p>It turns out Wheatley caused more trouble for GLaDOS than Twilight/me had anticipated. He had infected her with a virus or several viruses that had seriously messed her up.
<p></p>Megaman joined the thread sometime after GLaDOS returned,  and he was naturally horrified to learn about her affiliation with Aperture Science. It seems he was emotionally scarred by Cave Johnson's old blood-to-peanut water experiments.
<p></p>More recently,  The BLU Heavy arrived and started a more pleasant conversation with Cloud.
<p></p>First the Blue Bomber,  then a Blue Tank? All that's missing is Sonic the Hedgehog or Rainbow Dash.
<p></p>I think that Dash is the best candidate for the next Blue Blur. I mean,  she's basically a female Sonic in pony form.

            Not that one. I'm talking about the "Our avatars are posting on a forum thread" RP. Basically,  it's the same premise. I had referenced the thread earlier,  when me and Karl had played a scenario where Twilight (Yours Truly) and Trixie (Karl) settled their differences and became good friends.
<p></p>I was struggling to stay alive during that part. It was so heartwarming,  my heart was about to catch fire.
<p></p>Also,  where did you go,  Adannor?! I was so looking forward to meeting you,  but you had disappeared!

            I was hoping to meet you in Stormreach Harbor last night. On weekdays,  I'm only allowed on DDO from 7:00 P.M. to 9:00 P.M.,  Eastern Standard Time. Weekends,  it's from 3:00 to 9:00.
<p></p>Judging from your last post about reaching Level 2,  I assumed that you cleared the Korthos campaign and were ready to advance to Stormreach.

            No,  I didn't. I just begun exploring the island and doing quests. I have that Misery Peak quest open,  but I figured I better do other stuff before crossing the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn">Point of No Return</a>. <br>Then I got disconnected from the server,  figured it was a repeatedly threatened server downtime and soon went to sleep.
<p></p>I didn't dig around the interface much,  but does it have any sort of friend list so we could add each other and see when online/offline status?

            That's what happens when you have two friends that live in different time zones.
<p></p>Misery Peak's difficulty mostly comes from the hordes of mooks,  including the cultists,  undead and the ice spiders. There are only two challenging enemies,  them being a miniboss ice spider and an ice demon of some sort. If you can get a wizard or sorcerer hireling that happens to know some fire spells,  it will make the mission much easier,  especially when you fight the spiders and the demon.
<p></p>I'm hoping that <em>this time</em> we'll be able to meet. If I have you in my party,  I can replace the Cleric hireling I've been using with a Rogue. I've been really peeved by the abundance of locked chests and traps in the dungeons I've played lately.
<p></p>If you're worried about your healing spells being a bit lackluster,  I've kept two Wands of Cure Moderate Wounds with me for emergencies. Despite my Use Magic Device skill,  I can't use them properly,  so I figured a priest might have better chances.
