            The first chapter is in editing stage,  but will be up soon.
<p></p>I went for an incredibly stupid title of "Running Away",  because that is,  essentially,  what the story is about: Applejack running away.
<p></p>If you can think of a better title after seeing the first chapter,  tell me ^_^

            First chapter ahoy!

<strong>Running Away</strong>
<br><strong>Chapter One</strong>
<p></p><em>Dear Everypony</em>
<br><em>I know things have been pretty bad,  and ah apologize for it all.</em>
\
<em>After some thinking,  I’ve decided that it’s best for everypony if I just leave.</em>
\
<em>Permanently.</em>
\
<em>Please don’t try and find me. I’ll be long gone by the time you get this letter.</em>
\
<em>Am sorry.</em>
\
<em>Applejack</em>
<p></p><strong>12 Hours Earlier</strong>
<p></p>Applejack woke up to the rays of Princess Celestia’s Sun shining through the gap in the curtains. Getting out of bed,  she plodded over to the window and threw it open. Outside,  her big brother Big Macintosh was busy tending to the orchards. Applejack watched him with a smile on her face. <em>Just look at Big Mac. He’s doing a mighty fine job fertilis'n the trees… FERTILIS'N THE TREES?! SHOOT! I OVERSLEPT!</em>
\
Applejack raced downstairs,  knocking over Applebloom,  who was on her way to wake her older sister. Applejack didn’t notice,  her mind focused on getting the trees fertilised. Outside in the orchard,  Big Mac glared at AJ as she approached him. “Ah'm so sorry,  big brother. Ah overslept and…”
<br>“I’ve already done it all.” Big Mac walked off silently,  leaving Applejack to stare helplessly at the trees,  all carefully fertilised with the rotten apples of last year’s harvest.
\
“Ah am sorry,  big brother. Please,  it was an acci…dent…” Applejack suddenly heard somepony trotting toward them and turned to see a sobbing Applebloom running towards Big Mac,  a bruise having formed on her leg. “Whoa,  nelly. Am so sorry Applebloom! Ah didn’t see you!” Big Mac gave Applejack a stare that was on par with Fluttershy’s infamous Stare. Sensing that she was not wanted,  Applejack ran out of the farm and towards the Ponyville town centre. Several ponies waved to her,  but she didn’t wave back. <em>Nice going there,  Applejack. Two mistakes,  and it’s not even midday yet! I just wish there was somepony whom I could talk to… Twilight!</em>
<br>*
<br>“Spike!” Applejack heard Twilight calling out as she approached the door of Ponyville Library. <em>Heh. Poor Twilight would be lost without Spike</em>,  she thought as she knocked on the door. “Hey,  Twi. I was wondering… WHAT IN THE HAY?” If Applejack was drinking apple cider,  she would have done a spit take. Twilight Sparkle’s mane and tail was sticking up at odd angles and her eyes were wide with anxiety.
<br>“Oh,  hey Applejack. What brings you here?” Twilight trotted back into the library,  where dozens of quills and parchments and books were scattered around the room.
<br>“Oh,  it was just… Nothing…” Applejack could see that Twilight had a lot on her hooves,  and thought it would be best to leave her be.
<br>“Oh,  you can tell me what’s wrong. Don’t worry about this mess. I’m just trying to get a big report done for the Princess,  but I’m a little bit behind schedule because Spike has disappeared somewhere.” Twilight stacked all the parchments in a pile on the desk,  put the quills back in the ink holder,  and placed the books in a neat pile by the leg of the desk. She turned to Applejack and said “So,  what seems to be the problem?”
<br>Applejack hesitated. The last time she had seen Twilight this twitchy and nervous was when she couldn’t find a friendship problem and had to resort to making one. “Well… Ah’ve just got off to a bad start. Ah overslept and forgot about the fertilisin so I rush outside to do it and knock over Applebloom and then I get outside and Big Mac’s already done it all and…” Applejack poured out the events of this morning,  her eyes beginning to water.
Twilight placed a hoof under Applejack’s chin and lifted her face up. “Don’t worry,  I’m sure it’ll all be (or maybe turn out) fine later on today. Just let things cool down and return in the evening.” She smiled. “Now,  I’m really sorry,  but I must get back to work. Why don’t you go find Rainbow Dash? I’m sure she’ll help you forget about everything.”
<br>Applejack nodded and trotted outside,  leaving Twilight to continue with her work. As soon as she walked outside and closed the door,  she could hear Twilight shouting “SPIKE?! WHERE ARE YOU?!” The door burst open and Twilight stuck her head out. “AJ,  if you see Spike,  can you very kindly send him back here please.? Thank you.” With that,  she slammed the door shut again.
<br>*
<br>“Hey,  Applejack? Why the long face?” Applejack looked up to see Rainbow Dash hovering above her. The cyan pegasus was grinning from ear to ear. The grin faltered and then stopped altogether when she saw Applejack’s glum face. “Seriously,  what’s wrong? You look like someone has died.” Applejack let out a sarcastic “har har” before telling Rainbow the events of this morning. “Well,  Ah didn't get mah lazy butt up in time ta' help Big Mac do the fertalisin' of th' apple trees,  so he had to do the ENTIRE orchard by himself! Then,  on toppa that,  I was in such a hurry to rush out there an' help that I hurt Applebloom real bad. I coulda' broke somethin'!" Applejack broke down into tears. The cyan pegasus said nothing,  but simply wrapped her front hooves around Applejack's neck and hugged her tightly. “Cheer up. Everypony’s forgetful from time to time. Heck,  I sometimes forget to clear the clouds in the morning.” She withdrew from the hug. “You’re only a pony. You’re allowed to make mistakes.” Sensing that Applejack wasn’t going to smile,  Rainbow said “Hey,  wanna race? I promise I won’t use my wings.” Applejack smiled at the thought. She did enjoy friendly races with Rainbow,  even if she did cheat from time to time by flying.
<br>Just then,  something pink and fluffy came out of nowhere and landed on top of AJ. Pinkie Pie picked herself up and shook off the dust. “Oh,  sorry Applejack! I didn’t see you there!” she said with a big grin,  “You were so well hidden with the path that I assumed you were a part… Of… It…” Pinkie stopped midsentence. “Uh Oh. Something tells me that somepony has a frown on her face. Well,  turn that frown upside down!” Pinkie launched into a musical number about being happy,  one that could have topped her “Sharing And Caring” disasterpiece at Applaloosa,  and dragged a reluctant Rainbow into it. Rainbow fought against it,  but soon she was singing along as well. Not wishing to be a part of it,  Applejack rolled her eyes and sullenly walked away towards Rarity’s home,  the strains of “It’s okay,  don’t be sad! Just turn that frown,  upside down!” fading away into the distance. Even though they were not the best of friends,  Applejack knew that Rarity,  as the element of Generosity,  would be willing to help.
<br>*
<br>“So,  ah don’t get up in time to help Big Mac fertalise th’ trees,  and he had to do th’ whole orchard by himself! And then… In my hurry to get out there and help,  I run into Applebloom and knock her over! I coulda’ broken a bone or something!” Applejack sat in the main parlour of the Carousel Boutique,  where she,  Rarity and Fluttershy were having tea and cupcakes. She had just finished her story when Rarity said “Well,  darling. It appears that you are having a simply dreadful day. Your mane isn’t in its usual style. Here,  let me fix that for you.” Rarity trotted over towards a drawer where she kept all her bobbles. “Let’s see… Blue. No,  Green… Possibly,  to match your eyes. Pink,  oh heaven’s no. Come on Rarity,  think. You do have red bobbles in here somewhere!” Whilst Rarity was finding a red bobble,  Fluttershy took the opportunity to try and cheer Applejack up. “It’s okay. Big Mac will forgive you,  and Applebloom too! It’s not your fault that you overslept. Everyone makes mistakes.”
\
“Rainbow said that too… But it’s not just anyone who makes mistakes. It’s always me…”Applejack stared at the floor,  her voiced wavering slightly.
\
“Here we are!” Rarity galloped back,  holding a red bobble in the air with her unicorn magic. She tied back Applejack’s hair into its usual style and stood back,  admiring her work. “Simply smashing. You look… Oh heaven’s no! I forgot a bobble for your tail. That simply cannot do!” She rushed back to her bobble drawer and began hunting frantically. Applejack turned to Fluttershy and said sighing,  “Ah’ll see you later.”
<br>“But Applejack! Wait!” Fluttershy called after her,  but she was already gone.
<br>“Ah hah! I’ve found one! Now… Applejack? Fluttershy,  where’s Applejack?”
<br>“I don’t know,  she just left!” Fluttershy was on the verge of tears.
\
“Oh,  dear Celestia. I do hope she’s okay... Well,  we’d best just give her some space. I’m sure she’ll cheer up. I hope…”
<br>*
<br>Late into the night,  Applejack was still awake. She couldn’t stop thinking about what had happened,  how she had overslept,  missed the fertilisation and knocked over her little sister.
<br><em>Gosh darn it,  get a hold of yourself,  you silly mare! It was an accident. Nothing more.</em>
\
<em>But it could have been disastrous! The crops could have failed; Applebloom could have broken a bone!</em>
<br><em>Yes,  but think! They didn’t happen,  did they? No,  they didn’t.</em>
<br><em>But they could’ve happened!</em>
\
<em>They didn’t!</em>
<p></p>“That’s it! Ah give up!” Applejack threw back the bed covers and stormed out of her room,  down the stairs,  and out of the house. She galloped without stopping all the way to the library. <em>Ah can’t take it anymore… Ah just can’t</em>,  she thought to herself over and over as she approached the library. She paused before knocking on the door,  thinking of what to say if Twilight answered instead of Spike. If Spike was in at all. Applejack held her breath and knocked on the door,  three firm knocks. Inside,  there was shuffling,  and mumbled of “Who’s calling at this hour?” The door opened to reveal a purple dragon wearing a night hat,  holding a bunch of scrolls under his arm and looking very annoyed. “Applejack,  have you lost your mind? It’s 3am!”
<br>“Spike,  ah need you to take a letter.”
\
“A letter? Princess Celestia will be fast asleep right now. Can’t it wait until morning…”
\
“Ah am not. Writing a letter. To the Princess!” Applejack trotted around the room,  fetching a quill,  some ink and some parchment. “Take a letter.” She cleared her throat and began,  “Dear everypony. Ah know things have been pretty bad,  and ah apologise for it all...”
<br>“Wait,  if you’re thinking about running away,  then I’m not writing this. Look,  Twilight told me what happened this morning. It was an accident!”
<br>“Just write the letter,  for Celestia’s sake!” Applejack stomped her hoof,  her voice raised high enough to sound intimidating,  but quiet enough so that Twilight wouldn’t wake. She continued speaking,  “After some thinking,  ah’ve decided that it’s best for everypony if ah just leave. Permanently. Please don’t try and find me. Ah'll be long gone by the time you get this letter. Am sorry. Applejack”
<br>“Please… Don’t do this. Think of everypony! Me! Twilight! Pinkie! Fluttershy! Rarity!” Spike paused for a second,  “Rainbow! Your family! They’ll all be heartbroken if you leave!”
<br>Applejack looked at Spike,  tears forming in her eyes. “Am sorry,  Spike.” She picked up the letter and ran back to Sweet Apple Acres.

            Not to be a mood breaker or anything but ... am I the only one who never got around to actually liking this series ?
<p></p>I've tried,  I've watched episodes,  some friends (who are fan of the show) kept recommending me to see it,  I've seen clips of the dragon voice by John <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeLancie" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeLancie">De Lancie</a> ('cos I'm a TNG freak),  I've tried and tried again,  but I don't get it.
<p></p>I never got as much as a chuckle from any of the jokes. Of course the graphical style is beautiful (quite stunning as far as children's programming go in my opinion) but what's the point ? I don't see the appeal.
<p></p>And I'm not posting this just to troll or anything,  I genuinely want to understand WHY. Seeing that so much people seem to love this series there must be something I'm missing.
<p></p>Any thoughts ?

            I identify with Twilight a <em>lot</em>.  Specifically in that I never go outside,  and I tend to go crazy when overly stressed.

            For what makes the show really stand out to me: it's the characters. I really like the personalities,  their different chemistries with each other and the individual plots they can drive. Rarity is a fantastic,  fresh take on an old,  annoying archetypical character from kids' shows.
<p></p>For what makes me devote so much of my time on the show: it's the fandom. Even when I cherry-pick,  there's at least half an hour's worth of fantastic pony fan-material each day for me to check out. This is easily the most creative internet-subculture I've ever seen.

            I can see it being interesting from the point of view of having a large community for it online.
<p></p>Maybe it's just me. I was pondering through all the episodes I watched. I think the style of humor isn't for me,  it's the kind of humor that's invisible to me. It's not surreal,  but it's got an offbeat quality to it. The fact that everything is flashy-shiny fluo colors doesn't help either (even if again the show is very well animated).

            I can identify with both Twilight and Fluttershy. With Twilight,  it's the whole geek thing,  plus the fact that I get really nervous when Test's need to finished.
<p></p>With Fluttershy,  I'm pretty shy in real life,  and I'm kinda awkward at times,  as I'm sure a few of you have seen on this thread. I also have a tendency to over-apoligize like she does. And I'm also very quite most of the time,  plus I'm really good with animals.

            @A Crack in Time: Yeah,  I fit pretty much all of those.  Especially the stress one.  When I watched "Lesson Zero" my first thought was basically "hey,  I was like that all through high school and college!"
<p></p>But yeah,  I'm pretty much a mix of Twilight and Fluttershy (in real life I don't talk very often,  if at all),  with some Rarity on the side.

            I don't have Twilight breakdowns when preparing an assignment,  but I distinctly remember having several after I've turned them in and I'm fretting about getting failed on a technicality (goes double for the last term I had,  when every class I was taking was a bullshit general ed class that made every excuse it could to fail people and squeeze more tuition out of them).

            I'd say that I share qualities with quite a few ponies.
<p></p>I'm detail-oriented/obessive compulsive (Twilight),  I'm loyal to those I care about (Rainbow),  I have a double whammy of Fluttershy (I usually keep to myself) and Pinkie (I can be quite the chatterbox and funny guy with my friends),  I'm willing to offer help to anyone that seems like they could use it (Rarity),  and am dedicated to doing what needs to be done (Applejack).
<p></p>Of course,  I am also a clutz,  like my little Derpy.
