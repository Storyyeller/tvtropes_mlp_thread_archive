            Wait,  they move the sun and the moon,  not the planet? Well,  if there's more planets in this universe,  that only confirms that Celestia is not only a terrible ruler,  but also <em>destroyer of planets</em>.

It's a problem of the English (and Italian,  too) language. Celestia is a Princess as a ruler of a Principality. So was Luna,  who gets to keep her title despite not being a ruler anymore out of courtesy. In Equestria,  princely rulers have supermagical powers apparently. Meanwhile,  Cadence is merely a Princess by being member of a royal family.
<p></p>Since you are in the Netherlands: Vorst and Prins,  respectively ;) (though I don't know the female forms).

<p></p>Same reason any other smart ruler would do that.  Make sure everypony in the room hears the villain give a brief but detailed summary of their motives,  plans,  methods,  and source of power.  That way if your sledgehammer approach falls through due to the villain having sapped a bit more power than you expected (or apparently than Chrysalis expected — she herself seemed a bit surprised that she overpowered Celestia),  you're not the only one with enough information to try a Hail Mary.
<p></p>And I greatly enjoy the theory that Luna was absent because she was playing sentry at the tower when the shield broke,  then moved right in the thick of Canterlot tearing the shit out of half the changeling army.  If the camera panned 90 degrees further right during the fight sequence,  you would've seen Michael Bay style explosions.
