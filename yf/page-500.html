            X-COM. Chryssalids are genetically engineered aliens that claw you,  impregnate you with another chryssalid (which bursts out when the unit is killed),  and the clawing comes with a venom that turns the soldier into a zombie. Always in one hit,  no matter what armor they're wearing.
<p></p>And they're fast as all hell. Given the right circumstances,  they can claw all of your units in one turn.

Eh,  she seems to function fine. Pony society =/= human society
</div>
Fine? She lives in a hut at the edge of the forest. Going into Ponyville to buy groceries is a major hurdle for her. She folds whenever somebody is rude towards her (and we know that there are rude ponies). Even when hanging out with her closest friends,  the slightest criticism causes her to freeze,  and she finds it difficult to express disagreements for fear of hurting other people's feelings.
<p></p>That's not "fine". Granted,  Iron Will seems to have helped her out a little; but these do not seem to me to be the sort of issues that can be resolved by some public speaking and a few catchy slogans.

            @Carcio: It's an alien from X-Com: UFO Defense. It's basically what a Xenomorph/Facehugger/Chestburster would be like,  except it turns you into a mindless zombie in the process of depositing its ravenous brood into your chest. As a result,  it can multiply rapidly as long as there's enough human hosts around. One Chryssalid alone can create a whole army if left to its own devices. Also,  as you can see,  they look as creepy as hell.
<p></p>Because of these characteristics,  Chryssalids are the stuff of nightmares to X-Com players like myself and X.

            My problem with fluttershy: She's shy. OK,  that's fine. Does she have <em>any</em> other character traits? Yes. Do the writers do anything with it? Rarely. When they do,  it's alright,  but most of the time I just want to hit her face with a shovel every time she uses ellipses in a sentece.
<p></p>I'm exaggerating,  of course. I like her episodes,  don't like her in any others. Except when she's paired up with RD. They make a good <strike> couple</strike> duo.

            See,  the problem is,  that's not a flaw.
<p></p>A flaw is shyness,  I get it. Bad writing is "She's shy <em>and nothing else</em>". I like how they're using her now,  after some <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>,  who knows,  maybe she'll grow on me. Right now,  I just find her too flat to be interesting.
<p></p>Also,  do you play UFO 2000? That multiplayer mod for UFO Defense?

            I thought yesterday was her birthday...
<p></p>And I'll have you know that I was celebrating. There was a thread on /oat/ that was dedicated to Pinkie's birthday.
<p></p>Never played 2000. It sounds interesting though! Although the computer is punishing enough,  I'd like to see how a human could do against me.
<p></p>If I do get it,  maybe I'll square off against my dad. We're both X-Com veterans,  so I'm sure things will get interesting. He hasn't played X-Com in a while,  so I think I might have the advantage.
