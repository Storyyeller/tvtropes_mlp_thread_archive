            The way I see it,  Troll Fics are kind of like pranking. It's a joke played on a story,  but it's all in good fun. However since they are mainly made to create Chaos and Disharmony,  like the art of <strike> Discord</strike> trolling itself,  the "all in good fun" part could be taken with a huge salt boulder.
<p></p>Edit: Or what X here just said. (I got ninja's again!) The <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a> clause is the only saving grace for those fics.

<p></p>The problem is,  this isn't easy to do well. Often it comes down to overuse of bad spelling that makes it look like the author was mashing the keyboard,  but being a skilled trollfic writer requires a thorough understanding of bad writing.

            @Thatch: Ordinarily,  I generally dislike Troll Fics. I once had a burning hatred for them when the author of a Sonic Troll Fic decided to make a sprite comic based on his fic on Smackjeeves when I used to be a Sprite Comic author-junior there. Then again,  that was many years ago,  when I was too stubborn to give up to Trolls.
<p></p>Thanks to my training in the ways of The Troper and The Brony,  those fics don't bother me in the slightest. I still don't like them much,  though.
<p></p>@Jimmy: I have to agree here. Since Discord is the Master of Chaos and The God of all Trolls,  he is exempted from the standard rules and procedures of Troll Fics (if you could call them that).

            Re: the Pinkie theme
<p></p>Hmm...really not digging this composer and his sorta-techno-rave,  especially after how awesome Rainbow Crash's tracks have been.  Like,  at least the style actually fits Pinkie better than Rarity,  but it still feels really...I dunno,  hollow somehow.  It's not memorable at all.
<p></p>Actually the section in the middle made me think straight-up ska might've worked better.

            I maintain it's because he makes a coherent melody.  This was mostly just generic techno sounds in a slightly different order and timbre than the rest of the indistinguishable sea of it.

            @Jimmy: This is the quote the fandom brings up most commonly.  It certainly fits.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
Critics who treat adult as a term of approval,  instead of as a merely descriptive term,  cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up,  to admire the grown up because it is grown up,  to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are,  in moderation,  healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten,  I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things,  including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.
</div>
<p></p>Also,  that's a great idea of how to handle Discord.  He needs to be fully aware of how terrible the fic is,  and love it.
