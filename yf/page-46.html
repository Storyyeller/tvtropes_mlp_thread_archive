            The only problem that is apparent to me is that people are somehow getting bugged.
<p></p>If you are getting confused over the two threads,  it might be beneficial if you stated exactly what you are confused about.
<p></p>"It bugs me" doesn't really work,  after all. It would bug others to get rid of it. If you want,  then post in <em>one</em> of the threads. No confusion.
<p></p>Personally,  I can't put my finger on anything that would be annoying about it. I differentiate from both of the threads,  and have no ire or frustrations. If what you complain is true,  then perhaps I am somehow gifted with incredible brain powers.
<p></p>Oh wait,  there is one other problem. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> people complaining that it bugs them.

Is it offensive to OCD tropers? I guess,  in all seriousness,  I could have respect for that reason.

<p></p>She's not perfect and she went a little overboard,  but more than ten human lifespans spent alone is incredibly harsh. </div>
<p></p>I thought this as well,  a shame they didn’t really elaborate on her actions besides “she made it night for a long time and turned evil?”
<p></p>Made it night so long crops died and ponies starved? Evil enough that she haunted the dreams of ponies that they went psychotic and off themselves? What crime warrants what I can only figure is 1, 000 years of solitude confinement?
<p></p>Or maybe she’s old enough that 1, 000 years is considered a suitable “time-out” for fucking with the solar system for an immortal. She did seem rather sane for someone who spent the lat 1, 000 years alone. Then again,  maybe magical pony magic keeps one entertained or relatively sane.

            What I don't understand is why Luna didn't get nice-A-fied from the start,  like she did later on.
<p></p>Then again,  Celestia and Luna appear to be immortal,  so 1, 000 may not be that long to them. Not only that,  but Luna may not have even been conscious during her imprisonment.

            I didn't think I'd have to fucking spell it out for you,  but fine.
<p></p>If there are two threads,  I have to make two posts if I want every pony fan posting in a thread to see it. Which I don't usually bother with,  but that means you guys miss out on some interesting content,  topic,  or video. The same goes for the guys in the other thread. It's twice as much work checking two threads; not that that's a lot,  but it adds up to be annoying after a while. I also don't want this thread title to be an eyesore for people who don't want to participate in the discussion. It's not that I think it gives them permission to bitch,  but it does often result in bitching,  hype backlash,  and dumbasses popping in with the same Y THIS SO POPULER question every 5 pages. Pretty much none of that would be an issue if we just had a thread in Western Animation.
<p></p>What's your excuse? It's too sceawy? Okay,  fine. I'll acknowledge that it's reasonable to want a record of past posts,  but anyone who really cares can save it. We have the technology. And it's also fair to enjoy threads where there is a different prevailing opinion,  but I honestly don't see any real difference in that regard. So,  I still disagree with you strongly and believe I can fairly do so. C'mon guys. Just move over to the other thread and treat it like this one. It basically is this one.
<p></p>And yes if people are bugged,  it IS a problem that should be addressed when reasonable.
<p></p>@RE Luna: I guess the whole thing is kind of ambiguous,  so it's probably fair to assume it makes sense in context. How easily she gave up on her evil plot when met with kindness hints to me that she was really lonely and emotionally susceptible. Maybe the fridge logiciest part is that Twilight felt there was an urgent need to tell Celestia about a myth that she herself was a part of. Maybe Twilight assumed the exact date of the release might have slipped Celestia's mind.

<p></p>This thread has more posts. And history. And sentiment. And SOUL. And convenience. Plus it's in Yack Fest,  as opposed to western animation. That alone means that there are different things going on,  different posters,  different rules,  etc.,  and so on.

            I'm not really seeing the difference between the two threads myself. But then,  admittedly,  I'm rendered more or less blind to differences between topics on different subfora on account of only relying on either the watchlist or the all-encompassing post activity page to check for new posts/threads. So I tend to treat every thread as being equivalently "on the same subfora". But that's just me.
<p></p>But I've already offered a compromise solution in the thread linked to somewhere earlier in this thread.

            That's why polygamy exists in some places; reproductive success and basic survival.  In places where its not necessary,  monagamy is considered the norm as we have the luxury to focus more on the interpersonal relationships between the parents.

            Wow,  that actually would be a pretty sweet set-up. Seems like it might be pretty efficient in terms of reproduction,  but I don't know of many species that feature similar demographics. Might be because it's better to have more males to compete so the fittest reproduce more,  but considering how docile the non-Everfree creatures are,  competition might not be as much of a strategy for evolution.
<p></p>I'd guess that there's at least some tendency towards monogamy for some ponies,  or at least marriage. We have Mr. and Mrs. Cake,  and IIRC Rarity was looking forward to marrying the princess's nephew.
<p></p>Anyway... I just kind of assume that it's closer to coincidence that we see more female characters. Maybe male ponies tend to have less interest in community events and whatnot. I think the male ponies that we've seen so far that weren't jerks or idiots have seemed to be rather reserved. The pony that Apple Bloom was pestering seemed more intimidated by the kid than an adult ought to be. We've also seen a few running businesses. Could be they spend a lot of time taking care of business behind the scenes.
<p></p>Oh,  I guess another explanation that I doubt is likely from a meta-perspective judging from the tone of the series,  is a high mortality rate from childbirth.
