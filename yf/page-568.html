<p></p>Actually I'm playing it on my old desktop.
<p></p>Also,  the Repeater range is freaking impossible. I easily got 1st prize on the Breaker range,  but for the repeater,  2nd prize requires 48 targets and I haven't been able to even break 40 despite 2 upgrades and dozens of tries.

            The Breaker range was easy even without upgrades though. You just have to line everything up and do poewr shots and you'll get 1st.

<p></p>And my answer to the "No straight guy can like MLP" thing is something like "Well,   I'm the one who's secure enough in my sexuality that I don't think that my masculinity is threatened by watching a tv show..."
<p></p>Really,   that whole idea just sort of confuses me.  If the stuff you watch has that kind of effect on you,   couldn't you just balance it out by watching an action movie for every few MLP episodes you watch or something?  If watching MLP makes you gay,   could you be straight again by watching The Terminator?  How many episodes would that cancel out?     (Note I'm obviously not being at all serious here)

            Someone wrote a very interesting article on one of the writers of the show.  It explores why this writer's episodes are the most controversial among bronies.

<p></p>My favorite paragraph:
<ul><li><em>Merriwether’s episodes are divisive among fans because she tends to portray the world of Equestria more like our unfair and tough real world compared to other writers. In her best,  however,  she does her job well,  showing how the characters would react when faced with real situations.</em>

            Yeah,  I'm not even sure if that's an accurate summation of the trends in her writing.  I honestly don't find her episodes any more similar to the real world than anything else.  Like story said,  the main problem is that she tends to modify an otherwise consistent setting in order to make the plot work,  rather than write a plot that develops according to the way the setting is established.  The issue with say,  MMMDW,  isn't that the portrayal of Ponyville is more dangerous or unfair,  but that it's inconsistent with how it's treated in the rest of the show.  If they change had been in the other direction (Making Ponyville <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a>) I would make the same criticism.
<p></p>As for the other episodes,  none of my gripes have to do with the "realism" of the setting.  Dragon Quest isn't subpar because of the fact that Spike has an existential crisis,  it's subpar because to me at least,  it didn't handle the existential crisis in a satisfactory way.  The only issue I had with "Putting Your Hoof Down" wasn't the "realism" but the fact that Fluttershy's sudden descent into jerkassery is inconsistent with how she's usually portrayed.  Just because you want to do a more mature or slightly cynical take on the subject matter doesn't mean you get to create something that's not consistent with what we've seen of the setting.
