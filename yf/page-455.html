            From what I've seen and heard,  G1 wasn't bad,  and was watchable. Things went downhill from there until G3.5,  at which point it couldn't go any lower. Then came G4. G4 is the best thing ever.

            This sounds like the kind of unnecessary fussing about "things that haven't happened yet and might not even happen at all" that we saw from Twilight in <em>It's About Time</em>.

            Hey guys,  I've been thinking about about something.  If the MLP universe has an anthropomorphic personification of chaos in Discord,  shouldn't there also be some kind of being that personifies absolute order?  If this hasn't been done before,  I'm actually thinking about what a character like that would be like.

            They're not that hard,  honestly. though granted I had plenty of experience drawing in general,  so it was just a matter of picking it up... but really,  they're all just circles.

            @Keg's pic: They kind of look like a hybrid of G1 and G4 ponies,  if only in the face.
<p></p>Something worth mentioning. Some time ago,  a well-known Brony called 2007exalibur2007 (the one who did Team Fortress 2 redubs of MLP songs) was informed by Youtube admin that one of his videos (a Ponydub of a GTA title sequence or something) was a candidate for removal because,  according to them,  it was in violation of their user policies. He had responded by telling them that his video was completely legit with evidence to back it up,  but despite his defense,  Youtube went and removed it anyway.
<p></p>What the hell,  man?! They didn't complain about the original GTA video,  but claiming that a pony version of it violates their policy? This whole thing smells like a conspiracy against Bronies.

            The reason they took it down was probably because some idiot Anti-Brony trolls decided to flag it and report it despite it having nothing out of place. In my understanding,  they virtually had no real reason to do so!

            I think he might have reposted it,  most likely on his backup channel,  2009excalibur2009.
<p></p>Anxiously looking forward to the next Poniator video. Fortunately,  if memory serves,  he usually posts new vids around the same time new episodes air,  so that's a double-dose of new pony stuff. Doubtless,  there will be a section that references either <em>The Karate Kid</em> or <em>Rocky</em>.
<p></p>I'd like to see some more about Griffons. I'm not too curious about Zebras,  since it's been confirmed that Zebras are not native to Equestria and originate in a region somewhere nearby,  so I can just connect the dots from there. In contrast,  there are no details regarding the Griffons. Even though Gilda was just a one-episode character,  the absence of other Griffons raises questions as to where they originate and other details.
<p></p>Also,  from how Rainbow Dash met Gilda at Summer Flight Camp,  I'm guessing that Equestria's Flight Camp is open for all flyers,  since a Griffon was able to attend.

<p></p>DA: Well,  there is gonna be another griffon charector in the upcoming train mystery episode. He'll probably just be another minor charector,  but it's at least nice to know that the writers didn't forget about griffons entirely.

<p></p>While it's likely that it was a troll that flagged it in the first place,  Youtube is legally obligated to do the takedown first before even checking if the copyright claim is legitimate,  and (maybe) listen to an appeal later.  That's unfortunately how the DMCA works.

            Sort of.  In theory a takedown is of extremely minimal harm and easily reversible for a wrongful allegation (as opposed to,  say,  incarceration),  so a website would show good faith in maintaining IP (and thus qualify for safe harbor) by reacting immediately.  It's less guilty until proven innocent,  and more stop the presses until the problem is solved.
<p></p>The problem is that in practice,  the presses don't start up again because the process stops there.  Appealing a wrongful takedown kicks things into full-out legal mode,  which the average user isn't likely to have the resources to go through even if they're in the right â€” which they quite often are,  as something like a third of all takedown notices are outright copyright trolling.  Furthermore,  the sheer number of notices are such that they don't have the manpower to properly investigate that many of them.  Most can't be arsed to verify that it was sent by an actual rights holder,  much less poke through and make an executive decision on the nuances of fair use,  etc.
<p></p>The other problem is that with the whole ISP spying syndicate thing coming up in a few months,  they actually have circumvented the legal process altogether and turned it into flat-out assumption of guilt.
