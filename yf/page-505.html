            I like where this fic is going.
<p></p>I'm starting to think that the ponies in my X-Com squads are Part-Fluffy. They constantly suffer mortal injuries,  usually landing themselves in the Med-Bay for a whole month.
<p></p>Also,  when I looked at the Molecular Control Training report,  I noticed that Fluttershy had an M.C. Strength score of 6...
<p></p>Not only was this the worst Psi Strength score I've seen in my days as X-Com Director,  but it was <em>Fluttershy</em>. The Stare Master herself.

            My plan to form the New Lunar Republic or whatever the guild was gonna be called has been postponed for now,  as I have recently joined a guild along with my brother,  designation "Be The Hero".
<p></p>It's nice to be in a guild now,  especially since my brother's first order of guild business was to buy an airship. However,  my brother has been pressuring me to take Guild Renown points from Quest Rewards.
<p></p>Hmm...Running missions to collect valuable resources for a large organization...
<p></p>Am I the only one who thinks this sounds like <em>Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days</em>?

            I've seen Part B of The Small Horse 2: The Abuse,  played by none other than Pewdiepie.
<p></p>Poor Fluttershy got trapped in the Shadow Temple (yes,  THAT Shadow Temple).
<p></p>Edit: I retract that statement of sympathy! That was the Fluttershy from <em>My Little Amnesia</em> in disguise!
<p></p>The one I really feel sorry for is Angel Bunny,  who got trapped by the Dead Hand.

            I know,  right? Also,  I can now use gear that can be upgraded with those upgrade crystal-things,  which are guild-exclusive.
<p></p>I also like to jump off the airship. When you jump off an airship,  you wind up in a random body of water somewhere in Stormreach. But sometimes,  you spawn about a hundred feet or so above the Marketplace in free-fall. When that happens,  you had better hope that you have good HP and/or defense or have a Feather Fall at the ready,  or else you'll wind up as street pizza.
<p></p>Back to Amnesia: I like how Little Birdie (AKA: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ridley</span>) from <em>Metroid: Other M</em> appears in Small Horse 2. For a vicious little alien,  he's pretty cute.

            <div class="quoteblock">Eh...depends on how long it is. The problem is if you try to shoehorn in something potentially interesting like that after the fact,  most of your audience will already have left after a couple thousand words of brain pain via obvious trollfic. If you want to pull something like that off,  it'll have to be worked in very carefully from the start in a way that subtly signals that this isn't quite a trollfic and they really should keep reading. Frankly,  I'm not sure how to even go about that. Discord fucking around and playing along would be the more pragmatic approach. </div>
<p></p>It's funny you should mention that.  That's exactly how I'm doing it.

            Hey,  I can't find on the timeline the part where they talk about Rescue from Midnight Castle and how cool it was! This is a rip-off,  even though I haven't paid for anything.

            This is silly: but I just noticed that in the third century Plotinus wrote that Friendship is Magic.
<div class="quoteblock">
Love is given in Nature; the qualities inducing love induce mutual approach: hence there has arisen an art of magic love-drawing whose practitioners,  by the force of contact implant in others a new temperament,  one favouring union as being informed with love; they knit soul to soul as they might train two separate trees towards each other. The magician too draws on these patterns of power,  and by ranging himself also into the pattern is able tranquilly to possess himself of these forces with whose nature and purpose he has become identified. Supposing the mage to stand outside the All,  his evocations and invocations would no longer avail to draw up or to call down; but as things are he operates from no outside standground,  he pulls knowing the pull of everything towards any other thing in the living system.
<p></p>(Fourth Ennead,  iv)

            Basically,  he (a Pagan Neoplatonist philosopher from the late Roman Empire) is describing his theory about the nature of magic.
<p></p>According to him,  everything loves everything else,  directly or indirectly,  and within the limits of its nature; and the magician observes these currents of love between other things or people and,  by attempting to strengthen them and putting him/herself in a relation of love with other things,  is able to join them into greater unity,  power and beauty.
<p></p>I just found it vaguely funny that that's just a wordy way of saying "Friendship is Magic" <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
