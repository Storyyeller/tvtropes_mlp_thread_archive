            I went to Catholic school anyway,  but I think it actually ended up being a worse experience than regular high school would have been.
<p></p>I am so glad to finally be done with all that bullshit,  and I am never wearing a uniform again.

            I wore a uniform until the middle of seventh grade,  when I transfered to homeschool. None of my public schools since had uniforms.
<p></p>Also,  a lot of people in my new school like me. Probably due to my quirky sense of humor and tendency to break out into FAIC sometimes. Seriously,  I'm like a living Gmod video.

            Wearing uniforms really don't bother me. *shrug*
<p></p>High school's better than middle school,  at any rate. I keep to myself,  so I avoid all of the drama. Couldn't do that in middle school. Every other day people would insult me for no reason. Kids are stupid.
<p></p>Nah,  no bullies. Again,  I kept to myself and never talked,  so any potential bullies weren't interested.

            @LC: Children are brutal.
<p></p>For me,  though,  the bullying stuff stopped <em>immediately</em> as soon as I got to college. People still aren't totally mature,  but it's a totally different experience.

            @condo: I sure hope college is different than high school. Even though being friendless (Mostly,  anyway) has it's perks,  I do hope I can make friends and romance some in college.

            Thanks,  Connie. As for bullies,  there was one kid in my first year of public school (3rd grade),  his crony,  who pestered me upon his leave,  a Call Of Duty-playing,  wannabe gangster faggot in 6-7th grade (who loved to make fun of my size back when I was fat),  the aforemention ED kid,  his friend (who pussied out once I called the dean on him),  some kid in 6th or 7th grade who earned a punch to the jaw courtesy of me (although it was likely luck),  and a kid who was the human equivalent of a chihuahua in 8th grade. I also had a friend who acted bipolar and would start picking on me on occasion. I was actually on friendly terms with the dean in 6-7th grade,  and he helped me out quite a bit.

            If you want my advice,  keep it quiet until someone talks to you. If that doesn't work,  play it very slowly and stay away from awkward topics. I learned that Sonic was considered in 'for dumb faggot babies who poop in their diapers' territory in middle school. Pokemon had that treatment in one circle in middle school,  although I didn't get into it until about that time,  thanks to Nintendo Power and Soulsilver.

            My problem is that apparently I don't talk <em>enough</em>. People always ask me why I don't talk a lot,  and I tell them I just don't have anything to say.
<p></p>I can go on tangents about stuff I really like,  but if I have little or no interest in it,  my words are few.

            For me middle school was eh,  high school was actually pretty good,  and college went back to eh again.  Had lots of really good friends in high school; in college I never did find anyone who really shared most of my interests.  My dorm was full of athletes and gamers.  We got along well enough,  but there wasn't anybody to really talk to.
