            My latest batch of X-Com Ponies/Bronies has done very well!
<p></p>The Living Tombstone has been promoted to Commander,  which is the highest decoration for an X-Com soldier. He is also the first soldier I know to attain this rank!
<p></p>I still feel terrible for recruiting Shining Armor,  though. Even though he's a soldier,  my guilt keeps me from letting him die,  since I know Twilight loves him so,  and she would be devastated if she lost him.
<p></p>Oh,  and you died again,  Karl. This is,  like,  the second time that you've died in all of my X-Com sessions.
<p></p>I swear it wasn't my fault.

            Aha! You just gave me an idea!
<p></p>I'll resume that Pony Science Project I started a while back!
<p></p>This shall be Phase Three of Project Tolerance: Help other bronies build a resistance (or immunity,  if possible) to G1 Poisoning,  using the same methods of controlled exposure that were involved in Phase One and Phase Two. (although,  technically,  I haven't reached Phase Two since I've been distracted by other matters)
<p></p>We'll be using the same steps from Phases One and Two,  plus an additional step that I call Phase Zero. We'll be going in ascending order,  starting from Phase Zero.
<p></p>In Phase Zero we'll use the revised minimal dose,  which includes only screenshots from G1,  and is guaranteed to be completely non-lethal. While it is still "toxic" marginally,  I know that sufficient exposure to the dose will be enough to begin the process of building resistance.
<p></p>After that,  we move to Phase One,  where we'll move to short video clips of G1,  the mimimal <em>lethal</em> dose. By this point,  you should have reached the level of tolerance required to survive. If not,  G4 content will be available as an antidote for symptoms of G1 Poisoning. You are to use the antidote <em>only</em> when lethal symptoms begin to develop. You may choose which G1 clips you wish to view. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Videos that use G4 audio/video do not count!
<p></p>And finally,  we conclude with Phase Two,  where we will administer full episodes of G1,  the maximum dose as dictated by Brony Medical Regulations. At this point,  we cannot guarantee whether or not you survive. Your performance in this phase will depend on the abilities you developed in the previous tests. Also,  we will limit the antidote dosage to twenty Kyrospawn clips. However,  you are only required to view at least three episodes of G1 of your choice (from Friends or Tales) from start to finish.
<p></p>As a bonus challenge,  see if you can complete Phase One and Two while minimizing usage of the antidote.
<p></p>You may also take breaks between tests to recover and administer antidotes.
<p></p>Those are the rules. You may begin testing when you are ready.

            Was that sarcasm?
<p></p>Please bear in mind that I do not intend to hurt or poison anyone. I created this experiment because I concluded that the best way to deal with a deadly poison is to expose yourself to the deadly poison until it isn't deadly anymore.
<p></p>Remember,  try not to overdo it to avoid the risk of poisoning. Though there are antidotes at the ready,  you should try and avoid reaching the point where they become necessary.
<p></p>That being said,  let the testing continue.

<p></p>So I'm bringing you back into service from beyond the grave <em>again.</em> I won't let death stop you from doing your duty! (I know,  I'm a terrible boss,  but in times of war,  you can't afford to go soft.)
