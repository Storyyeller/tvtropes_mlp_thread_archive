            I get the feeling that if Lauren Faust weren't so tied down with appeasing the execs,  the background cast would be a bit more gender-balanced.

            It was pretty strongly implied that that was the case.
<p></p>I guess it's really not that big of a deal. I don't complain if there's a lack of decent female characters in a work,  so I'm not going to do the same for males. Sometimes it does seem like a missed opportunity either way.

            Most of the scenes that take place in public are shown during the day,  so it might just be that the male ponies are all working while the episodes take place. Most of the ponies that we see in the background look a bit younger than the main cast,  at that,  and regardless of what <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word Of God</a> says,  I still feel that they're at least in early adulthood,  so one could easily assume that the background characters are just doing as teenaged girls are wont to do,  roaming the streets.
<p></p>Backpeddling somewhat to the conversation about Luna (Not my fault you people update so fast),  I've been thinking about that and...I really,  sincerely hope that <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess"> Nightmare moon and princess Luna aren't one and the same. Partly because having the rainbow just help Luna shake off a nasty little magical symbiote almost guarantees epic plots in the future,  but mostly because if that isn't the case,  that would mean that it did something towards stripping some of her goddess-magic from her,  or worse yet,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal">buggered about in her brain box.</a> It might just be me,  but knowing that Celestia (and Twilight,  but she concerns me less) presumably has access to what could either turn out to be a god-killer or a tool for mass-brainwashing...brr...

            I really hope that is not the case,  because if it is...well,  that's even worse thant the current situation we have.
<p></p>Also,  at the library had to watch the old MLP movie. Spike was in it. And I was reminded what a difference it was to have actually good voice actors,  for this movie did not have it. And the plot was just painful. I was actually happy when it froze halfway through.

            This show is at least a little more gender-varied in terms of cast than previous MLP incarnations,  so I don't mind it so much. It's still not really fifty-fifty,  and most of the signifigant stuff is still done by female characters,  but hey,  I'm not really complaining because it's not an outright <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkBishoujoGhetto" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkBishoujoGhetto">Pink Bishōjo Ghetto</a> anymore.

'Course,  there could be some sort of unspoken taboo on it here that I'm not aware of,  I suppose.

<p></p>You have a point. Though,  I'm not all that invested in seeing this particular thread dropped in favor of just one,  it's just that I like to argue against anything that doesn't make sense to me.
<p></p>And this does concern other works. It bothers me that there are music threads in IJAM when we have threads for music that aren't getting the attention they deserve,  and I think those threads could also benefit from the input of posters that haven't bothered to venture from the middle of the forum.

            I'd be more at ease if the implications of such a relationship weren't something addressed by canon.
<p></p>There are a bunch of problems with this. Spike is a baby and Rarity is an adult. The size of the adult dragon we've seen implies that a physical aspect to the relationship would be... problematic. And all of that is before addressing that they're different species.
<p></p>I figure it's okay to appreciate the cuteness of it since he's just a kid,  but... I don't want that to come to a conclusion unless it involves Spike realizing that it's not feasible.
<p></p>On the other hand,  there's some precedent in fantasy for dragons breeding with other species and  there's no sure way of telling what rate dragons mature.
<p></p>I still don't think it's a good idea for the series,  but I guess there's space left for some satisfying fan-fiction if you're into that.
