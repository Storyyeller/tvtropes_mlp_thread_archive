            Meh,  the fans already thought Mrs. Cake was getting her icing supplied by half of Ponyville.
<p></p>Still,  you have twins of two different races to the mother.  Whether or not Mr. Cake was involved in the process there pretty much has to be some validity to funky genetics in play,  barring exceedingly improbable circumstances.

<p></p>How about the BGM during Rarity's catwalk in Sonic Rainboom? It sounds incredibly familiar but for the life of me I can't remember if it's just the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JimmyHart" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JimmyHart">Jimmy Hart</a> version of Tchaikovsky/Strauss or something original.

            It's very in character for her.
<p></p>In fact,  I think the characterization is very well done in that story.
<p></p>Although,  (and I'm kind of nitpicking here) I just can't see Rarity sweeping a <em>dirt</em> floor with her tail.

            The youtube videos do a good job of giving me a mental image of their voices.  It's basically like the Mane 6's but deeper.  I can't access Youtube from where I am now,  but just go there and do a search for "colt version".  I've heard Pinkie's Singing telegram,  THIS IS WHIIINING!,  Winter Wrap Up...  there's a ton of them.

<p></p>Oh,  a friend of mine is creating a new race for his D&amp;D-like game.  He's calling it "Equinus Faustus".  He's supposed to deliver the stats to me so I can assign Unique skills to the Mane 6,  but he hasn't yet.
<p></p>Wanna see the skills for Twilight Sparkle? <br>Too bad.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"><span class="purple">Twilight Sparkle</span>
<p></p>Unique Skill - <strong>Celestia's Faithful Student:</strong> Twilight can sacrifice Initiative to emulate any skill (Except Limit Breaks) of any ally nearby.  Twilight has a 25% chance to succeed the first time she emulates a spell.  Her chance for success increases by 2% with every successful casting.  Maximum success rate is 85%.
<p></p>Desperation - <strong>Meltdown:</strong> On every turn that Twilight's HP&lt;10% roll Willpower for Twilight.  On failure,  Twilight loses Initiative and at the end of turn casts "Meltdown".  Meltdown deals Lightning,  Fire,  and Water damage to all allies (Except Twilight) and enemies equal to Twilight's Magic + Target's Challenge Rating - Target's Willpower.  Has a 20% chance to cast Polymorph.</div>

            Pinkie's took the longest to write.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"><span class="pink">Pinkie Pie</span>
<p></p>Unique Skill - <strong>Party Time!</strong>:  As long as Pinkie has ammunition for her Party Cannon (Determined before combat.  Roll 1d8 for ammunition.  Ammunition does not carry over in between combat.),  Party Time can be used.  Pinkie sacrifices Initiative to prepare the Party Cannon and fires it at the end of the round.  All allies and enemies roll Endurance to determine success. Every ally that succeeds their Endurance check gain +20 to their d100 rolls for 1d6 rounds of combat.  Any allies that fail gain no positive effects from Party Time. All enemies that fail their Endurance checks have their d100 rolls reduced by 10 for the turn the Party Time is initially used.  The enemy gets no positive effects for succeeding.  Pinkie gains an extra action at the end of the round as if she rolled Natural 100 for Initiative.  Party Time can only be used again when the effects of the previous one wear off.  Allies' d100 rolls,  when effected in this manner,  cannot exceed base 90.
<p></p>Desperation - <strong>Party Of One</strong>: On any turn when Pinkie's HP&lt;30%,  roll Willpower.  If successful,  Pinkie Pie gains the effects of Party Time! (increased d100 rolls for 1d6 rounds and an extra action at the end of her turn)  She cannot use the Party Time! skill to affect allies and enemies when her HP&lt;30%.  If she fails her Will check,  she loses her action for that turn,  as if she rolled a Critical Failure for Initiative.

            This is the first episode I liked in a long time. It did what I've been wanting it to do for a while. Take established character traits,  and use them in new but sensible ways (Apple's pride,  Fluttershy's rabbit,  Pinkie Pie's talkingness)...

<p></p>I did really enjoy the rest of the episode. The chase scene was a ton of fun; the animation is only improving,  I think.
