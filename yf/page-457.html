            Hmm,  it would seem that Netflix has the first season of this show on the instant version. Not that this matters too much given that we have the internet and all,  but it's still pretty surpising if you ask me.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

<p></p>Just the opposite for me.  Rarity is basically the only character I've ever seen — anywhere — that made that sort of thing palatable enough to watch,  much less laugh at.
<p></p>Ponibooru's April Fool's prank is causing pretty amusing unintended consequences in some of the pictures.  The Instant Pinkie is inadvertently replacing characters in pictures,  or censoring convenient bits.  And...<a class="urllink" href="http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/159734">this thing.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<p></p>Heh...the Hub twitter is trying to troll people Tara-style.  Not quite the same thing,  but it's amusing nonetheless.

            Latest episode was great. I think this episode finally made me forgive the CMC.
<p></p>I've now shifted my hatred to Diamond Tiara.
<p></p>Okay,  I know she's a bitch,  but this episode really brought out the worst in her. She's ruthless,  ambitious,  cruel...everything a pony shouldn't be! How could a pony like Diamond Tiara even exist in Equestria? I would even go so far as to say that Diamond Tiara is the Spawn of Discord!
<p></p>Bottom line: Diamond Tiara is worst pony.
<p></p>Though I would like to read that article on The Great and Powerful Trixie. Not sure what it was about,  but I'll bet at the end of the day,  she'd have egg on her face!

            What's so hard to believe about Diamond Tiara existing? There are kids like that all over in our schools. It's not like ponies are purely saintly beings or similar nonsense.

            Okay,  I understand that. But still,  Diamond Tiara's attitude this time around was kind of jarring for me. Maybe it's because I haven't seen her in a while that her bitchiness caught me off-guard.
<p></p>Why am I not surprised that Discord decided to wreak havoc onto EQD?
<p></p>Also,  you may have heard that started showing Cartoon Network Classics at 8:00 PM on Fridays. IMO,  rather than show four episodes of classics for one hour,  they should start airing them full time. Certainly better than what they put on nowadays.
<p></p>I saw an episode of Foster's and an episode of PPG. When I saw "Written By: Lauren Faust" in the opening of the former,  a Sonic Rainboom went off in my head. Also,  Him showed up in the latter episode. It was one of his tamer appearances,  but still,  twas good to see Discord's predecessor.
