            So I finally saw my first episode yesterday,  it just happened to be on The Hub. It was The Cytie Mark Chronicles. I enjoyed it,  I know I definitely would have been something I loved as a kid (that one pony expressing annoyance that all the Cutie Mark stories are about "friendship and boring stuff like that" speaks so much to my eight year old self<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile"> ) I mean I wasn't super blown away by just one episode,  but I'll definitely watch it if I catch it on again.

            The Cutie Mark Chronicles isn't really the best intro episode. You have to get to know the characters before you see 'em as fillies.

            OK,  I have finally surrendered to the madness and watched an MLP episode. The cuteness is undeniable. If I were about 10 and female I'd probably think it was the best thing ever and be running around squee-ing like I was on a sugar high,  but as I'm not,  I don't think I'll convert to ponydom anytime soon. I'd rather watch <em>Kim Possible</em> or <em>Spongebob</em> in terms of recent-ish cartoons - the stories appeal more.

In true MLP fashion,  it isn't that hard to imagine that the process would be much less gross than in the real world and involve getting cool powers.

            I draw the connection mostly from the whole 'sign of being drown-up' thing. I suppose it's more about finding one's place in the world at the end of the day. Though if that's a sign of being grown-up,  then where the hell's my damn cutie mark?

            You could get one tattooed on,  but somehow I think a cutie mark would be less appealing on a human,  not to mention less visible...

            Unlikely. Thing is,  now this one is idealistic and hopelessly romantic to counteract the greyness of the world.

            One wonders if ponies use base ten for their counting system like we do. For some reason I find it probable to assume that they went with base four because of their quadrupedal physique.

            Well,  we're bipedal and don't use a base two system.
<p></p>Oh wait,  fingers. I see what you're going for there. Still,  we've invented a lot of numerical systems that don't use base ten. Binary,  for example,  is a base 8 system,  and I think I read that some old civilization had a base 8 as well. But we've heard them referring to numbers,  same as ours (Applejack and Applebloom asking for whatever amount of bits),  so I think it's fair to assume they have the same system as ours.
