            Has anyone seen the new toys Hasbro released?  <a class="urllink" href="http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1331615430797.jpg">I think this one speaks for itself.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small>  Aside from the fact that Trixie now has a last name,  they're pretty bad because of being nothing but a bunch of recolors.

Lyra and Sapphire Shores were present as well,  and both blatant Twilight recolors.  I mean,  the new blindbags are pretty much 90% recolors,  but those are the only ones I know offhand that have actually appeared in the show and clearly don't look like that.

            @Doctrine: I only know one fic that alludes to G1,  <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Progress" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Progress">Progress</a></em>. For example,  I know at least two G1 ponies that are in the story,  Sundance and Firefly. Also,  The Smooze is mentioned by Luna in a story. According to the author,  G1 is the "storybook version" of actual events in Equestria history.

            I saw a fanmade story for <em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</em> called "The Small Horse". I'm not sure about the story itself,  but from what I've seen from the gameplay clips...to tell the truth,  I'm not sure if it has a story at all! It's mostly a bunch of nonsensical scares than anything else. I found them more funny than scary,  though. Like at one point where two things briefly come out of the walls and shout "HELLO!" in what sounds like a German accent,  and when you find a key in a bonfire in a cabinet and it plays a clip from the guy yelling at cats (I'M GOING TO RAPE YOU!!) when you grab it.
<p></p>Oh,  and Pinkie Pie shows up. <strong>NOT</strong> Pinkamena.

<p></p><em>My Little Amnesia</em> is pretty cool,  though.  Fluttershy's voice is <em>spot on</em>.
<p></p>I'd also like to add that I'd actually be more afaid of Pinkie Pie leaping out of a dark corner at me than Pinkamena.
<p></p>With Pinkamena,  you know what to expect (she'll kill you and chop you up into teeny-tiny bits).  With Pinkie...not so much.

She would throw you a party. With cake. And probably balloons,  and streamers too.

            I also saw what appeared to be a mod that replaced Daniel with Fluttershy.
<p></p>One last adjustment to the My Little Portal crosses I did. I decided to change Twilight to Chell and gave the Morality Core to Spike.
<p></p>And I just realized I forgot to make one for the Fact Core!
<p></p>Well,  since Fact Core's a narcissist,  I'll give that position to Trixie.

            There are a lot of things that weren't meant to exist,  but they do anyway.

            I don't mean it like that. What I meant is that those events never happened in canon or fanon (popular opinion be damned),  and by extension,  Killer Pinkie and Pinkamena do not exist.

            I'm aware there are a number of <em>Amnesia</em> crossover fics. I wonder how many of them actually focus on the pitch-black atmosphere,  the sense of isolation and not knowing what's around the corner... as opposed to how many of them are just "lol servant grunt."
