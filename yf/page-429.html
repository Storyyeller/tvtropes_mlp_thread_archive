            Has anyone seen the new toys Hasbro released?  <a class="urllink" href="http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1331615430797.jpg">I think this one speaks for itself.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>â—Š</small>  Aside from the fact that Trixie now has a last name,  they're pretty bad because of being nothing but a bunch of recolors.

Lyra and Sapphire Shores were present as well,  and both blatant Twilight recolors.  I mean,  the new blindbags are pretty much 90% recolors,  but those are the only ones I know offhand that have actually appeared in the show and clearly don't look like that.

            @Doctrine: I only know one fic that alludes to G1,  <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Progress" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Progress">Progress</a></em>. For example,  I know at least two G1 ponies that are in the story,  Sundance and Firefly. Also,  The Smooze is mentioned by Luna in a story. According to the author,  G1 is the "storybook version" of actual events in Equestria history.

            I saw a fanmade story for <em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</em> called "The Small Horse". I'm not sure about the story itself,  but from what I've seen from the gameplay clips...to tell the truth,  I'm not sure if it has a story at all! It's mostly a bunch of nonsensical scares than anything else. I found them more funny than scary,  though. Like at one point where two things briefly come out of the walls and shout "HELLO!" in what sounds like a German accent,  and when you find a key in a bonfire in a cabinet and it plays a clip from the guy yelling at cats (I'M GOING TO RAPE YOU!!) when you grab it.
<p></p>Oh,  and Pinkie Pie shows up. <strong>NOT</strong> Pinkamena.

<p></p><em>My Little Amnesia</em> is pretty cool,  though.  Fluttershy's voice is <em>spot on</em>.
<p></p>I'd also like to add that I'd actually be more afaid of Pinkie Pie leaping out of a dark corner at me than Pinkamena.
<p></p>With Pinkamena,  you know what to expect (she'll kill you and chop you up into teeny-tiny bits).  With Pinkie...not so much.

She would throw you a party. With cake. And probably balloons,  and streamers too.

            I also saw what appeared to be a mod that replaced Daniel with Fluttershy.
<p></p>One last adjustment to the My Little Portal crosses I did. I decided to change Twilight to Chell and gave the Morality Core to Spike.
<p></p>And I just realized I forgot to make one for the Fact Core!
<p></p>Well,  since Fact Core's a narcissist,  I'll give that position to Trixie.

            There are a lot of things that weren't meant to exist,  but they do anyway.

            Neither does Pinkie,  if we have to get technical. But that does not stop her from breaking the fourth wall <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            I don't mean it like that. What I meant is that those events never happened in canon or fanon (popular opinion be damned),  and by extension,  Killer Pinkie and Pinkamena do not exist.

            I'm aware there are a number of <em>Amnesia</em> crossover fics. I wonder how many of them actually focus on the pitch-black atmosphere,  the sense of isolation and not knowing what's around the corner... as opposed to how many of them are just "lol servant grunt."
