            I'm starting think that the mare do well episode is going to be the season 2 version of "Feeling pinkie keen" and "Over a barrel",  A.K.A an episode that people bitch about for little to no reason. I'm not saying any of you are whining,  since you have fair reasons for not liking the episode,  But I'm talking about the controversy that the end of the episode stirred,  A.K.A the whole "Dash's friends humilated her" bullcrap.
<p></p>And I'm sorry about the streotype discussion I started. I'll try not to say any more stupid shit like that again.

            Eh,  it's the Rainbow of <em>Harmony</em>. I imagine to a normal pony who is already perfectly well harmonic it won't do much. I mean look at the effect it had on Luna,  making her <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel Face Turn</a>.

            Good point there. I guess said pony would need to have some <em>serious</em> personal conflicts going on for it to have an effect. Which I think the photofilly in my story has. Her pictures and articles managed to tear Equestria apart (not that much of a stretch when bad news is enough to make the ponies of Ponyville panic) and she suffers from a chronic need to capture the reaction to that sort of thing. Even then,  the Rainbow would probably just send her to a black void as a sort of Time Out punishment to force her to get her act together.

            Idea for a pony for me:
<p></p>Pegasus,  white coat,  blue mane and tail (with a white streak so it't a three-stripe deal),  Pontiac logo (or the Firebird screaming chicken logo) for a cutie mark.  Maybe some feathers tied into the Mane,  too.
<p></p>He will be the bearer of the Element of <strong>Excitement.</strong>
<p></p>(Yay,  copyright issues all UP in this [EXPLETIVE DELETED])

            Pvt's crappy idea for a fanfic:
<p></p>All of the royal guards (including both Celestia and Luna's personal detail) have gone missing!  An emergency call-up of retired guards goes forth all over Equestria,  and a handful of the senior retirees and the Mane Six must figure out what happened,  and attempt to correct it.  Features old ponies showing off that they still got what it takes,  but allows the Mane Six to shine when youth and enthusiasm is called for.
<p></p>All I'd need is a mechanism that got rid of the guards.

            For a while I sort of held Rarity and Fluttershy as joint favourites,  but I think Rarity <em>just</em> has the edge.
<p></p>I'm looking forward to more exploration of her past and her evident class angst. As someone on Youtube said "so,  when Rarity rebelled against her parents,  she was annoyed that they didn't conform <em>enough</em>?"

            I can identify with Twilight,  but I also identify with Rarity's fixation with making sure things are done the correct way.

            Now that I think about,  I'm a perfect Rarity because I tend to over dramatize situations.

            Rarity's whining turned me off,  but only becasue I'm a jaded COB (compared to the Forum average,  anyway).  Protip to guys:  Do not <strong>ever</strong> tell your Significant Other that whining is cute,  or in any way encourage them to whine.  You will spend the rest of your life regretting it.
<p></p>Fluttershy is best,  so nice and sweet,  while Twilight is one of those I'd like to stay up late with coffee or soemthing talking about geeky stuff.

            I think I'm most like a hybrid of Pinkie Pie and Twilight.  Rational and somewhat cynical,  but with a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> streak.  "Pinkie Sparkle"?
<p></p>I'm trying to convert a friend of mine (the one who was roleplaying Rarity this morning,  actually) and she said that the more she hears about Rarity,  the more she likes her.  Their personalities are very similar.

            Yeah Rarity's definitely up there on the list of characters that are fun in fiction but would be absolutely maddening to actually know for any length of time.  Pinkie is much the same way.
