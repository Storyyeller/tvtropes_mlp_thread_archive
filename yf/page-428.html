            If I remember correctly,  Tartarus — while also having some hell undertones — was mostly the prison place of the Titans,  immensely destructive creatures who challenged the gods. And Twilight did mention <em>monsters</em> who could escape from the Tartarus...

<p></p>It's quite obvious that he is a god,  and while I'm sure that there might be some powerful beings in there,  Discord is simply too much for Hell.

            The thing with Fluttershy is that she's either a passive doormat or an aggressive monster,  with a big tendency towards the former. Her problem is that she doesn't seem to be able to assert herself without slipping into her frighteningly intimidating persona.
<p></p>In a word,  moderation.

            Oh,  right.  This thread.  My guess for why Discord wasn't in there: if he busts you,  you <em>don't</em> want him surrounded by easily brainwashed monsters.  It would be like handing him his own personal army.

            I take Cerebus and Hell in this episode as not happening at all,  because not only was there absolutely no explanation for why a Cerebus appeared out of nowhere,  but Twilight's explanation of the consequences that it would cause were equally as random as his appearance.  Lazy writing.

            As a whole the episode did have quite a bit of filler.  The whole "disaster proof everything" montage and Cerberus thing didn't have much plot relevance when you get down to it.  And then at the end they repeated the entire Future Twilight scene.  I get the feeling that this was sort of a padding episode that they threw together in between more ambitious projects.  Which isn't to say that I didn't enjoy it (in all honesty,  it's in my top ten personal favorites),  but it still had a lot of flaws.

<p></p>Also,  I am pretty sure Celestia would have kept the discord statue under her nose so she could keep an eye over it.

            Agreed. At least with Celestia to watch over him,  Discord couldn't do much harm. If he were locked up in Hell,  he would have the Legions of Hell waiting for him. And then Equestria would be torn apart.

            It means Twilight forgot gravity probably isn't going to be constant when moving at relativistic speeds,  then biffed an integral.
<p></p>Still,  at least it's something syntactically coherent.  Usually cartoons just throw up an E=mc<sup>2</sup> and then start dropping sigmas all over the place with nothing attached to them.

            Wouldn't the integral be an arcsine instead of an arcsinh though?  sqrt(1-stuff<sup>2</sup>) is circles and would have the appropriate domain restrictions.

            Your substitution would have to be a sine or cosine so you can reduce 1-stuff<sup>2</sup> into a perfect square using cos<sup>2</sup> + sin<sup>2</sup> = 1.  Hyperbolic trig subs are only used when it's sqrt(1+stuff<sup>2</sup>) because the related identity switches the sinh term's sign.
