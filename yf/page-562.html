            I wound up getting both Portal games on Steam a while back for like $8 total.
<p></p>Come to think of it,  I don't think I've spent more than about $6 on a single game since I went on Steam.

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">@ed That brings up an interesting point on the subject of magical hybrids. Many fantasy settings simply have hybridization simply be a function of the creatures being inherently magical. This setting doesn't really have much of a precedent for that kind of hybrid,   though... Except for the Griffins. They are half eagle,   half lion,   after all. Do we take their existence as an indicator that magical hybrids are possible,   or do we simply assume that they occurred naturally?
<p></p>Edit: Forgot about the Manticores and Cockatrices,   though I forget what their classical mythological origins are.

            @ Story
<p></p>Considering in WAAPT we had a miniarc based on Portal 2,  the main story is pretty much completely spoiled,  though I don't know <em>all</em> the details. Also,  it runs rather poorly on this laptop :|

            Hi everybody!
<p></p>I started playing <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMarioWorld" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a> again. It is <em>incredibly</em> hard,  even using an emulator and saving liberally.
<p></p>How did I even manage to win it when I was ten or so,  and on a SNES?

Yeah,  that's probably it. Ten Years Old Me is very much disappointed in myself today,  though <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            Ecco is a bit too cerebral for my tastes.
<p></p>Also,  I remember someone back in the WA thread asking why I (13 years old at the time) was so interested in games that were older than I was. I have to cite the answer as "Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection". A gateway into a great,  much different era of gaming for a mere $30.

            No. Didn't know her. She was in a bad car accident about 20 years ago. She had the mental capacity of a two year old.
<p></p>Saw her once. <em>Creepy as hell.</em>

<p></p>I don't even know what to say about that.
