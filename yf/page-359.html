            It is also possible that Discord might have been responsible for corrupting Luna. He probably reached out telepathically and exploited her insecurities to his advantage,  hoping that he'd be able to benefit from her rebellion.
<p></p>@Karl: Nightmare Moon was just a title. I'm thinking that <em>true</em> Nightmares (if any exist somewhere in the world) are far worse.

            It's interesting,  however,  how Discord did not cause any <em>major</em> damage. He was responsible for chocolate rains and weird animal behavior and flying houses,  but not for rains of fire or large-scale devastation or anything like that.
<p></p>The Reign of Discord looked like something that ponies could survive: a bizarre and unpredictable place,  that's for sure,  but not the primeval chaos.
<p></p>Plus,  the way in which he was defeated looked extremely suspicious to me. I mean,  come on — just how many hints did he give to the Mane Six,  and why did he just stay there like a chump and took the strike of the elements instead of running away? "He's a creature of chaos,  and hence intrinsically capricious and unpredictable" does not seem to cut it as an explanation...

            For fairness,  I changed the Nightmares in my story into a secret organization,  but they're still pursuing supreme domination. They're still the same,  just shrunk down a bit so that they don't overpower Equestria...too much.
<p></p>@Carciofus: The first one is easy. A catastrophe of biblical proportions would be a bit out of character for the show,  recognized periphery demographic notwithstanding. I mean,  for Equestria to suddenly switch from The Shire to Mordor would be a bit jarring.
<p></p>As for the second concern,  Discord's pride convinced him that his plan was foolproof and that the Elements wouldn't work. However,  that seems a bit strange to me,  since I'm sure he could plainly see that his spell was broken from how the Mane Six had gotten their color back (and that Rainbow Dash was present).

            Or perhaps there is no big bad,  and all of the "narrowly avoided catastrophes" are part of a sneaky plan by Celestia and company to get the Mane Six to unlock the full power of the Elements.
<p></p>Discord is actually just Celestia's boyfriend,  who did her a favor and played the role of the "big bad" in order to force the Mane Six to confront their deepest insecurities.

            My headcanon is that the Nightmare was a leftover present from Discord.  When it got Luna,  Celestia didn't have a good enough handle on the Elements by herself to subdue and purge her without harming her,  so buying some time to set up something more precise was about all she could do.
<p></p>And just because I got so very,  very tired of Luna Angst fanfic,  my headcanon also involves the whole thing being Luna's gambit from the beginning to wipe it out for good by using herself as bait.

            I think the most hypocritically hilarious part of this whole thing is that even if you think Derpy is retarded as opposed to just clumsy and weird (i.e.,  <strong>most of Ponyville</strong>),  she would be one of the highest-functioning mentally handicapped characters in animation.  And <em>that's</em> the one the PC crowd wants stricken from the record.

<p></p>The moral of the story: if you're going to write a mentally handicapped character,  make sure to make them as ridiculously stupid and catastrophically obstructive as possible,  because that's okay.

            I have not actually heard any complaints about Derpy,  to be honest — everyone seemed quite enthusiastic about it,  at least over at EQD (I basically just indulge in the MLP fandom here and there).
<p></p>As for me,  I was pleasantly surprised by Derpy's presence,  but I did not really get the fuss. Yeah,  it was a nice nod to the fandom,  but I do not really understand the whole "OMG they know of us this is the greatest thing of the history of animation" reaction...

<p></p>Don't spread discredited rumours as fact.

Ponibooru was full of it,  and Gingerninja from the Western Animation <em>FIM</em> thread said that he "fucking hates" Derpy for "stealing" Applejack's episode.
