Ah,  alright. My answer stays the same,  though: me,  Twilight's library,  and possibly Twilight if she can spare the time (but really,  she <em>would</em> be interested in learning about extradimensional beings).
<p></p>Hm,  I'd have to get some way of scanning books â€” there is no way that I could pass the opportunity of gathering a wealth of information about a whole new universe...

What? We are nice beings! Sure,  we have ridiculous amounts of outrageously dangerous weaponry,  and we may have done a few millions atrocities or so during our history,  and our callous disregard for the well-being of other creatures or of the whole environment is the stuff of legend,  but we have our good traits too! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

I dunno. Ponies do not strike me as any more benevolent than human beings,  on average â€” they can be every bit as petty or aggressive as any human.
<p></p>The difference is that their society has a benevolent <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> (well,  one and a half,  now) at its apex,  and that was probably enough to avoid the nastier aspects of human history. If we had had the same,  I don't think that we'd have ended up all that different.
<p></p>And yeah,  as long as there's Celestia,  humans have no chance whatsoever to conquer Equestria. Compared to the sun,  all our atomic bombs are nothing more than a fart on New Year's Eve. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

We <em>are</em> humans.
<p></p>If we are speculating about other kinds of beings,  we <em>will</em> wonder whether we could take them in a fight. Those of us who won't wonder about the possibility of ghastly,  interspecies carnal acts instead,  of course. And some might wonder about both things at once,  I guess.
