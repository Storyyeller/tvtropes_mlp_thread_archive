            I think someone wanted this earlier,  so here's my analysis of...
<p></p>PONY CHRONOLOGY
<p></p>I think the earliest historical account of Equestria was that legend that Twilight found in the first episode. If it's accurate,  Celestia captured Luna in the moon for 1000 years. It's implied that they were adults as well as the monarchs they are now before that,  but it isn't clear how Equestria's world came to be. Also,  the two were confirmed by Faust to have had parents. So it seems to me that The world is at least about 1040 years old,  and the Equestrian kingdom can't be much younger,  if it is.
<p></p>After that,  we have character backstories. The flashbacks to when the mane cast got their cutie marks seem to be the earliest accounts we have of them. After those events,  Pinkie presumably learned to ice skate and laugh at her fears from her grandmother,  and eventually worked her way into Ponyville. Applebloom was probably born sometime after,  as well. Granny Smith's hip gave out,  and certain other ponies- Derpy and the earth pony with the cherry cutie mark- seem to not have aged noticeably.
<p></p>Episodes one and two obviously take place before any of the others. Hopefully we can agree on that much. It seems apparent that the episodes involving the Cutie Mark Crusaders have aired in order,  but a few of them are debatable. At the very least,  they had to have at first met before starting their group.
<p></p>The events of Sonic Rainboom took place before The Cutie Mark Chronicles,  since Twilight didn't know what a Sonic Rainboom was in that one. Also,  Swarm of the Century took place after Bridle Gossip,  since Twilight went to Zecora for help.
<p></p>Another hint at chronology is the gala. Ticket Master must have taken place before Suited for Success,  since Rarity is making them for that purpose. We also see those dresses make an appearance in A Bird in the Hoof. The events of the gala take place in the season finale,  but I guess we could have seen those
<p></p>Then we have Fall Weather Friends and Winter Wrap Up. The general consensus seems to be that Fall Weather Friends takes place first,  and I think that makes sense. It isn't clear when the gala takes place,  but I'm going to bet it's in spring since there are several flowers that only bloom for that day. Oh yeah,  and the series starts in the middle of summer.
<p></p>Other than that,  I think it's best to assume that episodes are aired in order unless we see evidence to the contrary. So,  I'd place them in this order.
<p></p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.
<p></p>After all that,  it seems as though it was only absolutely necessary to move the placement of Winter Wrap Up. Eh.

            It could also be how they see their calling as well.
<p></p>For example,  Cheerilee mentions that the the smiles on her flowers symbolize the bright smiling faces she hopes to bring to her students.
<p></p>However,  if a pony teacher decided that she wanted to teach in an overly assertive and strict manner,  her cutie mark might be a schoolhouse/jail combo. Or something.

</table><p></p>This image was sent to me by one of my contacts,  who for the sake of anonymity I will call "Agent #867-5309."  As you can see for yourself,  the image clearly shows a secret meeting of a Pony Coven in the sewers of New York.  These ponies have infected our youth!  The spread of Ponydom must be stopped!  Already,  they've developed a secret new weaponâ€”
<p></p>[<em>Suddenly,  Edmond hears a knock on the door.  Warily,  he gets up to answer it,  his pixie-stick ready.  Upon opening the door,  he sees nothing unusual at first,  then his eyes spot an unmarked envelope.  He picks it up,  and reads the letter contained therein.</em>
<p></p><em>All it says is "You gotta share,  you gotta care"</em>
<p></p><em>Upon reading these words,  a change undergoes Edmond.  His dark,  suspicious demeanor is dropped,  and he becomes joyful and happy.  Suddenly he turns on all the lights and lets out a loud WOOHOO before dancing like a man possessed.  Then he comes back to his computer,  all wide-eyed and hyper.</em>]
<p></p>So as I was saying,  this show is just <em>so good, </em> it makes me wish I were a pony!
<p></p>I don't normally collect toys,  but I might make an exception if I can find a Rainbow Dash somewhere.  She's awesome.  The perfect role model for men everywhere!
<p></p><hr>
<p></p>In other news,  has anyone else gone back and watched the 1985 cartoon after seeing <em>Friendship is Magic</em>?  I have,  and I couldn't help but notice (and laugh at) a lot of things that had never occured to me before.  Mostly though,  it just gave me some ideas for a crossover (though I'm betting its been done).
