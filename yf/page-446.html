            That was a really,  really adorable episode. They got the interactions between Fluttershy and Rainbow PERFECT. This showed just why I love Rainbow's character. She can be blunt and tough and brash,  but she loves her friends and will put her own desires aside to make sure they're okay.

<p></p>This was a really great episode,  for a number of reasons. Plus,  it was nice to see Angel supporting Fluttershy after seeing what an asshole he can be in the last Fluttershy episode.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">

            Eh I didn't like the episode. Geez,  just leave Fluttershy alone. I mean,  she has her niche,  caring for all those animals and so,  why not let her live basically as a landbound pony?

            Hah. Of course it all worked out in the end. That's a given. But to me it's the wrong message. The message should be "Excel at what you choose yourself" (and Fluttershy <strong>does</strong> excel at her niche) and not "Let others push you into doing their stuff,  even if it hurts you".

            Addmitly,  I did wonder why they really needed Fluttershy,  since I doubt that one less pony would have made things bad. Then eight other pony's got sick,  so I guess that rounds everything up.

            @Octo: The thing is that nobody was asking her to excel; in fact the message of the episode was "you don't have to be awesome at something to be able to contribute to it".  The entire point was that she didn't <em>have</em> to be awesome to be helpful.  RD didn't expect any more out of Fluttershy than she did from any other pegasus in Ponyville.
<p></p>The other thing is that this isn't just some sort of community event; it's a pretty important task that's vital to keeping the weather in Equestria working properly.   Fluttershy is,  by all indications,  the <em>only</em> pegasus in the town who wasn't trying to help out.  She's cute,  and I love her,  but being a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a> shouldn't give her a free pass to skip out on something that important.

            Of course she wasn't expected to excel,  and you'll notice I never said so. What should ideally have happened is RD asking,  <em>once</em>,  and when Fluttershy says no,  RD should have <em>left</em>. It's clear Fluttershy basically has a trauma over all those issues,  so she shouldn't have been pressured into doing it <em>at all</em>. She can tend to her animals as if she were an Earth pony. As I've said - basically treat her as if she were non-flying.
<p></p>Also,  fuck any sort of draft.

            I think calling it a draft is severely overstating it; from all appearances this is closer to jury duty. And this appear to be an event that 1. only occurs on very rare occasions and 2. is kinda vital for keeping the country in working order.  And it's obviously not that dangerous either if <em>every</em> pony in the town was expected to help out.  I don't think she should get to not help out just because she doesn't want to.  And there's no reason to treat her as a non-flier if she's entirely physically capable of helping.  She does have issues,  but I think calling it trauma is going a bit far; I'm sure she wasn't the only pegasus who was teased in flight school.  Heck,  RD was probably bullied more than Fluttershy was.
<p></p>I should also note that at the end of that scene RD <em>was</em> willing to leave Fluttershy alone,  and then Fluttershy took it on herself to take part.
