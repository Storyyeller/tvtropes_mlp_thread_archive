            Someone on Omegle said that Pedobear was actually seven years old,  making him technically not a pedophile. (Not sure if I believe that,  though)
<p></p>That made me think of another misunderstood character,  Pinkamena Diane Pie. Everypony accuses her of being a murderer and a sociopath,  all because of a stupid fanfic. But in reality,  she's just a scared,  lonely girl who only wants to be loved.
<p></p>I'd help her,  but (if memory serves) since it's commonly agreed that Pinkamena is a separate entity,  I don't want to risk creating a second Pinkie Pie. The world and Equestria would not survive the following cataclysm.

            Building upon Demo Ant's theory:  Pinkamena and Pinkie (and by extension,  Surprise) are seperate entities in the same sense that Jekyl and Hyde are seperate.
<p></p>I'm not sure that the two (three) even know about each other,  and furthermore,  I posit that the seperation was caused by the Sonic Rainboom.
<p></p>If Pinkie had never seen it (read: was <em>directly</em> exposed to it),  she would likely have grown up a well-rounded (albeit somewhat dour) pony.

            I don't agree with that. This "Pinkamena" is not a different personality. Pinkie has always been extreme in her reactions (extreme happiness,  extreme anger,  extreme panic,  etc). The infamous scene in <em>Party of One</em> was brought about by extreme frustration and (perceived) betrayal. It's still Pinkie Pie,  just one that's really <em>really</em> mad at her friends.

            It's the "Ask Pinkie Pie Solutions" ask tumblr. An AU version of Pinkie that didn't see the Sonic Rainboom and basically grew up to be a way more stable and intelligent pony. Though,  she's not at all "depressive" or gloom or anything like that. She's just stable.

            Like I said,  extreme. She has mood swings like you wouldn't believe.

            Unless you're playing the Pathfinder variant,  in which case you powers of sorcery could stem from a number of possible sources,  including demons,  fey,  or just plain magic. I rather prefer it that way.

<p></p>Yeah,  I have this utter hatred for anything that gets too popular by studios forcing it down your throat weeks in advance.  GLEE,  the <em>actual</em> Royal Wedding,  and The Avengers are classic examples.  Here,  these two last episode MAY BE the only ones I am THIS CLOSE to skipping.  Hasbro is holding massive events,  celebrity appearances,  artwork,  online plugs,  ads,  posters,  banners,  and TV bumps for a wedding about two character we <em>know nothing about</em>???  What happened to the strong familiarity with the already-established characters we got to know and love for all these months???

            I thought the same way given all the hype over a wedding. But once I saw the involvement of evil Mane Six clones and a sinister plot,  my interest was piqued.
