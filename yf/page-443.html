            I read right before I go to bed a lot,  so I usually just downloaded a chapter or two right before I left campus for home.  It's pretty good about organizing chapters episodically instead of leaving you on idiotic cliffhangers.

            Yes,  that was the one.
<p></p>As for reading the Dresden Files: the first book is Storm Front,  but it is kind of subpar compared to the others. I think that the series starts hitting its stride with the third book (Grave Peril.)

            For anyone overwhelmed at the prospect of reading Fallout Equestria,  try reading one chapter a day. It certainly works for me. At least until it started having chapters that were over a hundred pages long.
<p></p>And I've also been meaning to get into the Dresden Files. But y'know,  money.

            Fallout EQ is worth it. If you never played Fallout at all it may take some getting used to,  and in that case please stick with it. If you are ready aware of the FO universe,  then it will be very intuitive.

            I went searching for bronies on Omegle.
<p></p>Results were disappointing.
<p></p>Then I accidentally set off a flame war in spy mode between a brony and non-brony.
<p></p>Then I went to Cleverbot and got him to sing Cupcakes with me.
<p></p>I saw a fangame called Go Fast,  in which Fluffle Puff (that pony with the impossible fluffy coat) races Rainbow Dash on a skateboard. If she goes too fast,  she turns into what I call Shazbot Puff (she becomes a soldier thing from ''Tribes: Ascend) with a cry of "Oh Shazbot!" and flies into space. I was mostly amused by the Shazbot.
<p></p>Fluffle is the greatest SHAZBOT!

            That reminds me of a Pony Fortress 2 gameplay video. At one point,  the players were doing impressions of Paco and Fluttershy from Dress.Mov and Shed.Mov respectively. There was also a ton of assorted weirdness and micspam.
<p></p>But since I can't play Team Fortress 2 because of the brick and steel wall that is Steam,  I feel bad that I cannot experience the funtastic brony servers firsthand.
<p></p>By the way,  has anypony seen "My Little Pony in Thinking With Portals"? It's a series of fan vids in which the ponies use Portal Guns to help out in their everyday life. From the maker's comments,  it would appear that Aperture Science has decided to conduct the field testing for the Portal Device in Equestria,  and it's available to buy for only 60 Bits.

            @Fluttershy: She is. In fact,  the episode opens up with her panicking,  then fleeing the scene. And then she never appears again for the duration of the episode.
<p></p>@Portals: One thing got me puzzled. How was Apple Bloom able to buy some Conversion Gel? Since that stuff was made from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> moon rocks</span>,  it should've been too much for her to afford with whatever she earned. And given the apparent toxicity of the gel,  I don't think they'd sell that to children.
