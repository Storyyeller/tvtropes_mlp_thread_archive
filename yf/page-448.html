            From what <em>I've</em> seen,  a big reason why some furries might dislike bronies is because bronies actually have a great big hate-on for furries in general. Like,  it's amazing how much some of them hate furries. My guess is it's a proximity issue; MLP is close to furry for some peoples,  especially lately,  so they feel the need to prove how not-furry they are by bashing any anthro stuff they see.
<p></p>Generally speaking insulting someone at every opportunity is not a good way to endear yourself to them. Of course there's always the chance that the whole "denial is magic" episode may have caused some of the furry hate as well.

            Did anybody else here read the MLP/Watchmen crossover that got featured on Equestria Daily a few days ago? I must say,  I greatly enjoyed it. Rorschach is not entirely in-character,  perhaps; but still,  I found it really cool.

            She was calling out Fluttershy on outright bullshit excuses,  but backing off and letting her sort things out herself while still being supportive when she started freaking out.  I gotta say I was pretty darn impressed with Dash this time.

            I too was impressed with Dashie in this episode. Then again,  her 3 episdoes didn't exactly ruin my image of her in the first place.
<p></p>But yeah,  this episode is probably one of the best of this season. Huge improvement over the last one.

And I agree Although this episode lacked a bit in the plot development there was vast amounts of Character Development for Fluttershy

            The <a class="urllink" href="../yf/page-441.html#post-11006">conversion efforts<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> are going well.
<p></p>On Friday night,  she and I watched "Green Isn't Your Color, " then "Baby Cakes".  I didn't tell her anything about the episodes before we watched them except that GIYC was Fluttershy-centric and BC was Pinkie-centric.
<p></p>Her first impressions: <br>Photo Finish is annoying. <br>Pinkie Pie is ridiculous. <br>Twilight Sparkle seems to be the most level-headed. <br>Baby ponies are adorable.
<p></p>She went to her parents' house this past weekend and dug out one of her old MLP toys.  It's a G1 named Baby Sleepy Pie.  We cleaned her up and she looks almost as good as new.
<p></p><strike>It was a real bonding experience.</strike>

<p></p>I started with the first two episodes and boast busters. Success is getting 3 friends to admit that MLP:<a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a> is not <em>bad</em>. Although the biggest complaints were when pinkie pie started singing.

            I saw the episode the other day where Fluttershy talks in a really deep voice because of some kind of sickness,  is it wrong I kept laughing because she sounded exactly how people sound when they huff computer duster?

I may end up scrapping it since none of my friends seem all that into it,  but it's a fun little time-waster.
