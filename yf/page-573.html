            @ATC: Protip: Pretty much any time somebody uses a smiley,  it usually means that they don't intend for the statement to be taken seriously.  And in a thread as off-topic as this one,  you should take pretty much everything with a grain of salt unless somebody actually says they're being serious.

            Very well then. Usually,  the use of a <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue"> denotes light hearted tone not meant to be taken seriously.

<p></p>It would work better if it came before the statement.  That way it seems like less of an afterthought.

            How I could tell it was joking: In the middle of people saying one thing,  someone says the opposite in a very extreme but deadpan manner. If they actually thought that,  they would have said 'I disagree' or 'Actually I think' or something like that,  and they also would have phrased the criticism differently. For one thing,  they probably would have given some actual criticism about why they think you're bad instead of just spouting a meme with no elaboration.

ATC: I was indeed joking,  and it was not meant as an insult at all — it was just a silly attempt at <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumour" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumour">Hypocritical Humour</a>,  combined with a suggestion that you were taking the whole thing way too seriously.

<p></p>On another note,  I decided to swear off webcomics forever,  as they end up taking up too much of my time. I Pinkie Promised.
