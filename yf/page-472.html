            <div class="quoteblock">You bring up exactly what's the problem: The self-labeling. Liking a show,  well,  nobody can say anything against that! But when it reaches the point of self-identification,  well,  then that's something different. Hence there is in fact a great difference between "I like MLP" and "I'm a brony". Even if you ignore all stereotypes associated with bronies,  it would still make a large difference.</div>
<p></p>No,  the problem is not people who choose to label themselves but don't meet <em>your</em> crappy standards. It's you having crappy standards and expecting people to meet them if they use a word about themselves.

            Well,  if I identify myself with a fandom,  that because I know full well what I'm getting into. I don't care for the most "odd" side of it. And if someone is throwing around insults directed at the whole fandom,  and you take it personal by association,  the problem is more about you than the fandom,  really. No offense.

            Self-labeling is just something that people do. I mean,  most of us here are "tropers",  right?

<p></p>Same with "brony". If somebody used that moniker as a primary means of self-identification,  I'd agree that that would be more than a little messed up; but it seems to me that the vast majority of people just use it as a tongue-in-cheek shorthand for "MLP fan".

That's only true of a very very small portion of the fandom,  but it's kinda understandable that normal people who watch the show wouldn't want to call themselves bronies if that's the image it's going to conjure up.

            One hears negative stereotypes about a group they belong to.
<p></p>They say to themselves: "These stereotypes don't apply to me."
<p></p>The group they belong to has a label.

<p></p>Ta-da! The stereotypes no longer apply to them!

            @Japanese Teeth - Just like everyone thinks all of us nerds are basement dwelling,  obese manchildren with no social skills,  no matter how much we've proven that stereotype to be something almost entirely wrong countless times.
<p></p>People like labeling what's different from them,  we all do that. It's natural. You've got to just shrug it off and not let them ruin your fun.

That's what they say about just any subculture ever.
<p></p>As an aside,  what's the deal with basements and with the whole "living with your parents" slur? Is there some facet of American culture that I am missing?
<p></p>I mean,  my parents' house is on the third floor of their building,  so it does not even <em>have</em> a basement; but the only reason why I'm not living with them is because I'm working in another city,  and in another country as a matter of fact. If I took a job in my hometown,  I'd probably return with them (and pay them something for the rent,  obviously) — I mean,  we get along fine and we can help each other and I'd rather give my money to them than to a random houseowner...

            Basically,  the basement is underground,  where there's no light and no one ever goes to,  so there's absolutely no social contact in any shape or form there. It's like locking someone in a dungeon. That's pretty much it,  really.
<p></p>And Americans still have the stereotypes that people who live with their parents after their mid 20's are unfulfilled manchildren who can't move out because they're sad.
<p></p>It's mostly thrown about by teenagers and bad TV shows,  though. The more mature crowd realizes how dumb that is,

            See,  that's the problem,  labeling actual personality issues as just throwaway gags ends up making those people bitter.
<p></p>Society in general needs to grow the fuck up and leave everyone to do whatever they want (so long as no one harms anyone,  that is),  instead of looking for scapegoats for our latent social issues. Worldwide.

The reason?  I'm working on my master's degree,  and with the economy in its current state it's saving me thousands of dollars a year to not have to pay rent and it's basically beneficial to everyone involved.  The assumption that everyone who's living at home is being childish is just dumb.

            Yeah,  if anything,  it's dumb to get an apartment of your own in order to feel all "grown up" if you have no real need of it otherwise.
<p></p>Wasting $400 (at least) per month,  now <em>that</em>'s dumb.

            That was exactly my motivation.  Not to mention that around where I live my options were either get an apartment that was ridiculously expensive (like $800-$900 a month for a small one) near school,  or get a cheaper one further away and waste time and money on gas in addition to rent.  Current setup,  I only have to pay for gas,  which is expensive,  but not as bad as gas and rent.

            Okay,  last word about this before I shut up. This thread is supposed to be the one without drama:
<p></p>If one wants to hate Bronies who obsess over the show,  won't shut up about it,  or whatnot,  they're entirely free. However,  they shouldn't word that as "I hate Bronies". Hating labels is idiotic,  because there's so much figurative collateral damage (people getting hated for no good reason) in that.
<p></p>I hate Christians who are intolerant to other people's religions and want their own faith to define Western society. However,  I'm aware that not all Christians are like that,  so when I meet a Christian,  I don't act rude or aggressive toward them until I have reason to believe they're the type of Christian I hate.
<p></p>It's such a basic thing,  and yet so many people have to suffer ridicule and annoyance because it seems hard to learn.
