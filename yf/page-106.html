If anypony would like to contribute an original villain feel free to do so. You can also submit artwork of canon villains (including those from the older series,  like Tirek).

            Yo. Bronies. What do MLP fans call cutie marks when they're on a male pony? I know the fans came up with a name for it,  I just can't remember what it is. I need to sleep,  but this will keep me up all night. Help me out,  please?
<p></p>Also,  what would a good bondage pony name be? Leather Lash? Gimpy Gus? Once Again? XP (just babblin' out of my sleep-deprived brain. Don't mind me.)

            @Buri: Leather Lash is actually not a half bad name.
<p></p>@Death: Really?  I assumed they were all 10-13.  I mean,  they act and sound like they're still just kids,  and live in a universe where it isn't really that hard to imagine a kid owning their own business.  There's also the whole matter of their families never really being mentioned (as far as I know) except for Applejack's.  I also can't imagine anyone over 14 getting excited about a slumber party or having pillow fights at said slumber party.

            ^^ I've had teenage girl slumber parties at my house. I can assure you they can get very excitable even after 14.
<p></p>Twilight's parents arranged for her to be taken into a prestigious school after they saw her insatiable appetite for knowledge. They saw her being taken in as Celestia's personel protege when she was just a kid.
<p></p>Pinkie Pie's family was seen to work on a "rock farm". Presumably she set out on her own when she was of age.
<p></p>Fluttershy,  Rainbow Dash,  and Rarity's families are never seen,  though Rarity's little sister comes over all the time.
<p></p>Applejack has a <em>big</em> family and two siblings but her parents are never seen or heard from or even mentioned. Dialogue suggests they don't live with their children though.

            Don't get me wrong,  I wasn't trying to disparage slumber parties,  they're awesome and... actually,  I don't know where I was going with that train of though.
<p></p>Anyway,  huh.  I'm still just a newcomer to the show,  so I didn't really know all of that stuff.  I just kind of thought it made sense that the ponies would be in the same age-range that the target audience (which I'm fairly certain is 5-12 year old girls,  despite a growing periphery demographic) is,  and I thought we were being led to believe that that was how old they were.  And to be fair,  a <em>lot</em> of kids' shows have kids as the main characters who either have no parents or whose parents simply aren't mentioned.

            Hey,  this just turned into <em>exactly</em> my kinda thread!...in the last tow pages,  which I totally missed. Oh well.
<p></p>I think Faust said that their in their mid-late teens,  like 16-18,  sorta,  but I always imagined them as more in the range of 18-22-ish.

            Really?  So I'm the only one who had them pictured as kids this whole time?  Huh.  They just really seem to look and act like children to me,  but whatever.
<p></p>Edit: But hey,  all the more reason for me not to feel old.  And this way I don't feel like some kind of pedo for watching the show.

            Well,  for one thing there are kid-ponies shown alongside the main cast—most notably the Cutie Mark Crusaders (Apple Bloom,  Scootaloo,  and Sweetie Belle).
<p></p>Also in one episode we get to see the main characters as fillies.

            Okay,  so I guess they aren't kids then.  They're just... sort of kid-like.  Not that that's not to be expected,  since the show is intended for children and therefore can't show the cast experimenting with sex and drugs and whatnot like real life high schoolders and college students do.
