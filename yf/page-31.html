            Don't force it. Don't expect anything. Just watch it.
<p></p>If you expect ANYTHING out of it,  like most movies or anime series,  you'll reach disappointment.
<p></p>It's just a show to watch.

            Don't have a chimney.  And so it's basically the first two episodes that are cliche,  eh?  I suppose I'll watch the second just because otherwise the first part will be incomplete and actually look at the rest then.  Thanks.

            Chances are,  if you were not remotely enjoying yourself by the first episode,  you probably won't like the others.
<p></p>It's not the plot that everyone loves,  it's the characterization and the lack of stupidity in the plot (usually). But mostly,  characterization.
<p></p>I completely understand not enjoying the plot and thus not enjoying the series,  so just be aware of what people see as 'the big deal' about it,  and if it doesn't ring with you,  it doesn't ring with you.
<p></p>For me,  it was the fact that the cast was made up of super girly characters that <em>were not annoying.</em> Hell,  Rarity is one of my favorite characters despite being the fashion-obsessed snob archetype which I HATE to no end.
<p></p>That being said,  the plot is very lacking,  and I agree completely.
