            Well,  I'm sorry you feel that way. But there's a good balance of humor imo.

            Not everyone has a tolerance for cuteness. It's a little strange that you would look at it if you have that kind of reaction to intentionally cute things. I can understand trying to broaden your horizons of course,  but <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a> is a show that pretty much revels in cuteness. In comparison,  I hear that Lord of the Rings is a good series,  but I'm not into old medieval,  wizards and elves type settings,  so I never really bothered with it

<p></p>Well,  admittedly,  I'm not sure what episodes you've watched,  but I recommend you at least watch Party of One and Bridle Gossip. They're good ones.
<p></p>And if you don't like it after those two,  well,  you tried. Next time someone tries to shove it down your throat,  punch them where it hurts. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            @Jack: I don't hate the show,  or people that watch it. I just don't get the appeal.
<p></p>@Death: I've no idea which one I watched; there was some kind of contest,  and the pony with the rainbow tail was having confidence issues...because the pony who was all hot and stuff got the central part said contest and took it way too seriously.  There were rainbows and flying horses,  and a lot of cheering.  That's all I really remember.

<p></p>Bridle Gossip is the one in which a certain pony starts talking in an incredibly deep black guy voice.

            Out of curiosity,  Drunk,  have you seen Firefly/Serenity,  and if so,  did you have the same reaction of "actively dislike" to Kaylee that I had?  Because I definitely got the "I'm cute so I'm exempt from consequences" vibe off her,  and I think I'm the only one on earth who kind of wants to smack her across the face and tell her to grow the hell up.
<p></p>For my part of "why do I enjoy it?":
<p></p>The ponies kind of fall into the "kitten category" you mentioned,  for my money.  I do normally dislike <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes">really cutesy stuff</a>,  so it's kind of odd that I enjoy this show so much.  I guess part of it is that being cute doesn't exempt a character from bad things happening to them in this show (for the cartoon definition of "bad things",  anyway),  and a lot of the morals are about how not to be a bitch or an asshole,  and they actually manage to communicate them effectively without being overly-preachy.  Most of the time,  anyway.
<p></p>Also,  the show realizes that it can't base all its appeal around cuteness,  and so actually makes an effort to have funny gags and interesting storylines and characters.  Yes,  most of the episodes are stock cartoon storylines — this show doesn't get too many points for originality — but they tend to execute the old standbys very well,  and add just enough to them to keep them interesting.  I think the show would still stand up well if it had the animation style of,  say,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdEddNEddy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdEddNEddy">Ed,  Edd,  n'Eddy</a>,  though it would definitely lose something without the cute factor.
<p></p>Then there's the great voice acting,  background music and songs,  and animation.
<p></p>Finally,  it's a My Little Pony cartoon in which the soundtrack has featured Heavy Metal on two separate occasions (so far),  so I really have to give it points for that.
<p></p>It's definitely not for everyone — nothing is,  outside of breathing — but I think a lot of effort and love has gone into it on the part of all the creators,  and it definitely shows.  Thanks for giving it a fair shot,  anyway.
