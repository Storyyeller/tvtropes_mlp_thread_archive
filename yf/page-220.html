            @ABNDT: It's my favorite episode,  for the following reasons:
<p></p><ul><li>Introduces Zecora
</li><li>First episode in which Applebloom has a major role
</li><li>Pulls off the "respect other people's cultures" moral without being overly-preachy,  and with a surprising amount of nuance for a kids' show.  I particularly like how it emphasizes the role of fear in instilling bigotry in generally good people/ponies.
</li><li>Contains Flutterguy singing Pinkie's Evil Enchantress song.
</li><li>Jokes are consistently solid throughout the episode.
</li></ul>

            I also think Bridle Gossip is the best introduction episode.  There are the reasons listed above as well as .. I'm not sure how to say it,  but somehow having the mane cast be different from their usual selves gives an idea of what their usual selves are like.
<p></p>Maybe it's because they are deprived of the things that are most important to them,  like beauty,  ability to fly,  strength,  being the voice of reason,  etc.

<p></p>Bestter use Dragonshy or swarm of the Century.  Horever Ticket Master may be best if,  it first ep after pilots and it show all mane cast.

            Honestly,  I still hold by watching the series in order. It's really not that jarring to go from the openers to the slice of life stuff; they do resolve the plot so it's not as if it seems out of place. And besides,  they were <em>designed</em> to introduce people to the show.
<p></p>Also,  it's Saturday now(technically)! That means I can switch back to being Colt!Twilight!

            Feeling Pinkie Keen is a great episode to watch after knowing the cast. So a 2nd or 3rd one to put on your list.

            Dragonshy is a pretty decent introduction to the characters,  as it has characterization moments for each of the mane 6. Twilight is organizing the team to deal with the dragon,  Dashie is being all "Fuck yeah,  let's do this!",  Fluttershy is having trouble facing the dragon,  Rarity is constantly worrying about her appearance,  Applejack takes charge by helping Fluttershy around the mountain,  and Pinkie...well,  she's Pinkie
<p></p>On a different note,  I'm trying to find ways to keep myself awake until 7:00 alongside marathoning Friendship is Magic,  and because it involves movement and focus,  I decided to put on Beatles Rockband. I gotta say,  listening to Friendship is Magic and playing Beatles Rockband at the same time is really awesome

            I'm pretty much just forcing myself to stay awake. It's annoyingly difficult,  but also kind of fun at the same time. Usually when I stay awake until the morning,  it's usually just because I feel like it. It's kind of interesting having an actual reason to stay up for once

            Initial Thoughts:
<p></p>EDIT: Oh my god,  I am so sorry,  the spoiler blockout didn't work!  Did I accidentally spoiler anyone?!
<p></p>Let's try this again.  Avert thine eyes if the following is not blocked out:
<p></p><ul><li><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Discord is EPICALLY EVILAWESOME</span>
</li><li><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">I'm really glad to see they've given a bit more detail on the history of the world.  A thousand Headcanons died this day — but their deaths were not in vain.  I really hope we see more.</span>
</li><li><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fluttershy's "corruption" felt kind of like a cop-out.  But then,  I suppose that was the point — she's so pure Discord had to cheat.  Also,  holy shit Fluttercruel is even more surreal than Flutterage.</span>
</li><li><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pinkie's corruption felt pretty cheap — until I remembered that she's been established to have insecurity issues RE how she's perceived by the others and Discord can cheat using magic.  I was really wondering if they were going to have her go Pinkamenahair when she "fell",  and that would have been AWESOME,  but alas,  no dice.</span>
</li><li><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The beginning felt really rushed,  but that's understandable,  given all they had to do in the span of 22 minutes.</span>
</li><li><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out the haters are right: the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs">CM Cs</a> really do ruin everything.  I still can't hate them,  though.  "And the moral of the story,  kids,  is don't fight with your friends,  or you'll unleash an ancient primeval force of destruction upon the entire world."</span>
</li></ul><p></p>All in all,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">I am most definitely not disappoint</a>.

            @Smilingcloud: Not as of yet.  Equestria Daily will link them once they're up,  and they'll probably get them in there as soon as they go up — my understanding is they're pretty good about that.
<p></p>You're not the only one checking — their pageviews are climbing at a steady 2-3/second as people refresh the page looking for the links.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">
