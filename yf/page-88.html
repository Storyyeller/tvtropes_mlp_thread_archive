            Excellent point.
<p></p>@The Mighty Anonym,  I'm sorry...? I just don't like her and I only considered the mane cast and recurring characters.
<p></p>Narcissists always had the patented ability to infuriate me. I can sympathize with her,  understand her pain,  and even feel sorry for her,  but overall,  just no.

Not the editing itself,  but deciding which clips to use where. The lyrics where they talk about romantic things is especially hard,  because there's really not any scenes that talk about that kind of thing (I don't think,  at least)

            Yeah,  that's tough.  You're basically limited to Rarity's fantasy sequence from The Ticket Master and scenes of Spike crushing on Rarity,  unless you're willing to take scenes out of context to ship Apple/Dash or something.

            I managed to get past most of them so far,  but it's getting harder and harder. The first lyric where they mention love is "What do I do when my love is away? Does it worry you to be alone?" I took it in a different direction by making it about Applejack's love for her family (with her flashback scene). The next part,  where they say "Do you need anybody? I just need someone to love. Could it be anybody? I want somebody to love" I mixed it up a little bit and used both clips of Applejack with Twilight and clips of Applejack with Dash. Then finally,  when they say "Do you believe in a love at first sight? Yes,  I'm certain that it happens all the time",  I made it about Fluttershy's love of animals with her flashback

            Well,  I WANTED to use the part where Pinkie walks up the hill playing her instruments (from Swarm of the Century) or maybe the trombone part at the end,  but it was a bit too silly looking for the first part of the song. Most of the Pinkie singing clips are a bit too silly looking,  and I didn't want the beginning to look silly and ridiculous right from the start. I ended up compromising by using a clip of her dancing in the party (from Party of One). It works because it's a serious enough looking clip,  but still involves Pinkie and music. Not to mention the dancing actually goes to the beat of the song

            So I just watched Pinkie's Singing telegram again,  and noticed something...that pinkie in a tux is the most adorable thing I've ever seen. NO!

            I doubt that'd work,  because WMM needs the source files (the original videos and music track that I made the AMV out of) to read it. If I sent it to someone,  it'd probably just be a blank video

<p></p>Favorite character: Twilight Sparkle
<p></p>Second favorite character: Spike
<p></p>Third favorite character: Pinkie Pie
<p></p>Character you can relate to the most: Twilight
<p></p>Least favorite character: There isn't one that I dislike,  but I can't say I'm pleased when Applebloom gets a lot of screentime. Actually,  Silver Spoon and Diamond Tiara were pretty aggravating. Or Twist... Call of the Cutie wasn't my favorite episode.
<p></p>Cutest character: I don't see how this can't be Fluttershy. Or <em>filly Fluttershy</em>.
<p></p>Favorite meme and/or fan based joke from the show: Does "secret butt fun" count? If not,  I'll go with the Moonbase Alpha memes.

<p></p>Seems strange that it's missing the feature to actually properly export the video. Is it a trial version? Given how huge the files involved must be,  it would probably be easier for someone to just send you a program that can do the job instead. I don't know how far you've got in your work,  though,  and if it's definitely something that should be recovered. If you could save it internally within the program,  the data must be somewhere,  and maybe it's somewhere that can still be exported to a version of the program that can export stuff.
<p></p>Buuut I'm hardly an expert on that stuff. You'd be better off asking on an actual Pony site to reach a larger pony audience. I think the only one here who has shown any sort of expertise in creating videos is Josieph.

            I really don't understand the objection this fandom seems to have to furries. I mean,  I really don't care for the general objection to furries,  being one myself,  but it doesn't even make sense as carry-over here. And not just because of the whole message of tolerance,  these are sentient,  talking horses with humanoid expressions who occasionally walk erect and deal with everyday human objects. We are literally <em>fingers</em> away from being in furry territory here.

            To make a sweeping generalization here,  furry fans make shitty art and unfunny comics. The linked comic was an example of that,  and was what cued the fist shaking. Anthropomorphic animal characters don't bother me at all. If that were the case,  I'd be annoyed by a huge number of cartoons,  including Loony Tunes and Disney characters.
