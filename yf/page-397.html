            The overall game would be against Discord form the beginning,  so the main cannon fodder would probably just be whatever weird shit I could come up with.  Main bosses would mostly be brainwashed characters.
<p></p>It'd only get into scary-weird territory for the last two levels.

            Yes,  but since Discord is a reality warper,  he likely knows of what kind of stuff exist's in the fandom {And he'd probably be aware of the fact that he's in a tv show},  which is how he comes up with the various bosses and enemy's for that level. Plus,  he's techiclly a troll,  so that's where the trollface enemy's come from.
<p></p>I wonder if Trixe or Gilda would be involved in the game at some point.

            Trixie would be the stage 2 boss.  Her opener attacks resemble stage fireworks,  and she uses a Most Definitely Not Master Spark.  Her last couple patterns have a twist I'm gonna go ahead and keep close to the chest just in case I ever make it.

            Allright then. I hope that one day,  you'll get around to making this game,  because I like what you've told me so far. I have just two more questions about it though:
<p></p>1: What would the title be?
<p></p>2:What would the gameplay probably be like? I can't help but picture this as a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doom" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doom">Doom</a> type game.

            1) Not sure.
<p></p>2) Shoot-em-up.  Like the video I linked last page,  though not quite as absurd.  Typically shoot-em-up refers to Gradius-style planes and flak,  not FPS-style.
<p></p>If for no other reason,  than because a shoot-em-up is one of the easier types of games to program.  The basic engine is really,  really simple and you can spend more development time on the game itself.
<p></p>I might have a bullet hell option unlockable,  but as much as I enjoy it I feel like it's kind of taking over the genre lately and I'd rather at least start out with a more classic style.  So that would be less crap on the screen,  but generally coming at you quicker and you actually have a reasonably-sized hitbox.

            As the animation is flash based you could probably create a game that catches the look of the show to a tee if you knew what you were doing.

            It'd pretty much have to be C++/C# based.  Flash has major issues with memory management,  and its graphics processes tend to bring good systems to their knees over trivial stuff.  It's great for little things,  but tends to break down pretty badly after a certain point.
<p></p>Let's put it this way,  if you're generating potentially hundreds of objects in a few seconds,  you probably want to actually have a way to straight-up delete them.  Flash doesn't have that,  and it's way too easy to leave enough loose ends that the garbage collector doesn't find it.
<p></p>Most of the animation would be top-down spritework and still portraits anyway,  so yeah.  I'd probably use Flash to generate the image,  then capture it from there.
<p></p>Anyway,  <a class="urllink" href="http://raikoh14.deviantart.com/gallery/32882385?offset=0#/d4quoqo">here,  best pony.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>  And everything that artist has ever drawn for that matter — does an amazing job of giving a sense of depth without looking creepy.

<p></p>Okay,  I don't mind the fact that they uncrossed her eyes,  nor do I mind that her voice is slightly different (it's still the same actor),  but they don't even have the common decency to SAY HER NAME?! FUCK.

            I do prefer the new voice (I mean,  it helps when your voice actress knows she's not supposed to be a dude <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">),  but still.  Feels like we lost something wonderful just because a small handful of people decided to be assholes on behalf of another small handful of people who weren't offended in the first place.
<p></p>I mean I feel that bears repeating.  Everyone I heard in this argument who <em>actually had some sort of mental disability</em> was okay with Derpy.  This was almost all white knighting gone mad.

            I'm fine with the new voice,  but "fixing" her eyes and removing her name is just asinine. Watching that edited scene makes me cringe.
<p></p>I am disappoint,  <strong>but</strong> I'm not going to send death threats to Hasbro or anything. The real villains are the fuckwits who complained about Derpy when the episode first aired.
<p></p>This pretty much sums up my reaction:

            Well technically they never said that Derpy <em>wasn't</em> her name,  so I guess there's still that.

            If anything,  the edit itself would be more "ableist" than the initial portrayal.  I mean,  imagine if someone got offended over the portrayal of a black person,  and the network responded by digitally altering the footage to make the character white.  It kinda raises more problems than it solves,  you know?
