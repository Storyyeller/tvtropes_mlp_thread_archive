<p></p>well,  it makes it hilarious. Let's leave it at that.
<p></p>I quite enjoyed the pilots,  myself,  but I think I enjoyed them in a bit of a different way from the others. There was the cutesy-ness that persist throughout the series,  but I think it was the novelty that brought me into it. I was so surprised to see these pastel-coloured ponies going up against an ancient evil god...
<p></p>This is the thing that get's me about debates over whether slice of life or epic is better. I love the slice of life for the characters. I didn't get enough of an epic dish to really give an opinion on it. For all I know,  it could simply be the novelty of it,  and once that wore off you would simply have a very odd premise with an overall meh execution. Because let's face it,  the pilots were pretty generic.

            Personally,  I don't really care either way,  there's something to be enjoyed about both.
<p></p>It's just that since the show already seems to lean in the direction of episodic slice-of-life,  it would take a lot of work to pull off a successful transition to epic adventure. Or something approaching that,  at least.
<p></p>I could see them pulling an epic adventure for a movie adaptation,  but not as the main series.

            I think the series is doing well as a slice of life series with mini-adventures mixed in.  Some of my favorite episodes are ones where they have to go on some type of quest to do something,  but episodes about the ponies day to day lives are cool too.

            The pilot was pretty generic. And I found it ridicilous how Twilight pretty much made "best friends forever" in the span of a single day. Of course,  the um... <em>Story</em> needed to get started and couldn't sit around for a better portrayal of ponies bonding.

<p></p>I imagine Fluttershy would've went to the ground eventually,  Rainbow Dash would've probably still figured out she loved racing,  Twilight was a fucking time bomb of magical power and the boom just accelerated her,  and Applejack probably would've gone back to the farm eventually. She hated it in Manehattan.
<p></p>...I bet Rarity and Pinkie Pie would've been screwed,  though.

            I still remember the one episode where Fluttershy said,  "You're.  Going.  To.  LOVE ME!"
<p></p>At that point I was thinking,  'Oh shit...  Someone's going to die or get seriously injured.'

            @Kuro: Look at the house she lives in. She's <em>always</em> lived in that house. Her parents are probably absolutely loaded,  and she's like one of those trust fund kids who just does the dresses not to get by,  but because she loves doing it. And besides,  there always seems to be some sort of order for her. When you really think about it,  evening wear isn't in huge demand for us,  either. If nothing else,  she can probably sell some of the gems she uses if money get's light.

            Hmm,  good points all around...
<p></p>EDIT: Game Chainsaw,  I raise you a page image from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapstickKnowsNoGender" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapstickKnowsNoGender">Slapstick Knows No Gender</a>.
<p></p>But yeah,  that's about as much "<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">hurt</a>" they'll ever get.
<p></p>So,  season 2 promises us more Luna and possibly a voiced role for <span class="strike">Derpy</span> Ditzy Doo. Well,  if they decide to make that Derpy's canon name.
<p></p>I mean,  "derp" is a bit too "made up internet word" and usually carries negative meanings about low intelligence. Though Ditzy Doo sounds <span class="strike">kind of</span> really silly as well.
<p></p>LET THE WILD MASS GUESSING OF THE CANON NAME OF DERPY HOOVES BEGIN!

            RE generic pilots: Honestly,  most of the plo- er,  stories of the entire series were pretty generic.  They just take the old stock kids' show stories and do them so well that it's entertaining.  The best example of this I can think of is the Pinkamena party scene from "Party of One".  "Character feels unloved by their friends due to a misunderstanding,  so holds parties/conversations with inanimate objects" is among the most ubiquitous and overdone stock cartoon tropes in the book.  But the writers and animators just execute it so well that rather than hackneyed and boring,  it becomes legitimately sympathy-inducing,  hilarious,  and slightly terrifying.
<p></p>The same can be said of a lot of the episodes.  "Dragonshy",  "Fall-Weather Friends",  "Bridle Gossip",  etc.
<p></p>TL;DR: MLP:FIM doesn't really win many points for originality in its episode storylines.  They just pull off the old stock tropes so well that it's quite entertaining.  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreNotBad" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>,  and all that.
