            Fallout Equestria is an exception,  mostly cause I've never read it.
<p></p>As for those infamous ones like <em>Rainbow Factory</em> and <em>Cupcakes</em>,  I've been able to laugh at 'em. I think it's mostly because of their portrayal in <em>Rainbow Dash Presents</em>.

It has awful charector derailment,  the story itself is okay at best,  and it started the pointless trend of having a bunch of torture fics in the fandom. On the other hand,  the alernate endings are hilarious or at least intreasting depending on which ones you've read,  I love the alternate ending fanfic "A Precious rainbow" and it's sequels,  and some of the fanart that comes from this fic is hilarious,  or awesomely scary.
<p></p>Rainbow factory is just plain dumb,  although I love the song that it's based off of. Go figure.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            I still haven't read Rainbow Factory. I need to get around to that sometime,  at least to see.
<p></p>Cupcakes was pretty badly writtenâ€”I probably wasn't supposed to laugh at the organ puns. I think it's interesting how cupcakes!Pinkie,  or Pinkamena as she later became,  got absorbed into the fandom so much,  though.

<p></p>I mean,  cupcakes was written before Party of One aired. It already had some weight for being the first notable grimdark fic in the fandom,  and then Party of One comes along and shows a borderline homicidal Pinkie...

            Surprisingly,  I never read Cupcakes . . . but I <em>did</em> watch an animated adaptation of it. The one that was supposedly done by one of the show's animators,  but I have my doubts. That thing was the single most gruesome animation I ever saw. I could feel a great deal of the torment Dash was put through by Pinkie (that was too weird to type,  I simply cannot imagine Pinkie doing that). Great stuff,  if you're into it.
<p></p>That dancing in-between scenes was weird,  though. Seriously,  what was up with that?

            Cupcakes and Rainbow Factory were both pretty stupid.  The infamy is just that Cupcakes was the first really noteworthy shock fic that was at least kind enough to be written legibly.
<p></p>Fallout Equestria was more disturbing than both of them (I mean,  the raiders in Ponyville alone did exactly that <em>and worse</em> several times over),  and moreover had a <em>point.</em>

<p></p>I saw a very sad PMV called Exile that featured the song <em>Exile Vilify</em> from <em>Portal 2</em>. The video was about Luna's corruption and transformation into Nightmare Moon,  and the great emotional trauma experienced by both her and Celestia (but then again,  what else would PMVs based on those events focus on?). The song matched the mood oh-so perfectly...It made the ending of <em>On a Cross and Arrow</em> pale in comparison.
<p></p><em>You've got sucker's luck</em>
<p></p><em>Have you given up?</em>
<p></p><em>Does it feel like a trial?</em>
<p></p><em>Does it trouble your mind</em>
<p></p><em>The way you trouble mine?</em>
<p></p><em>Exile</em>
<p></p><em>It takes your mind again</em>
<p></p>-sniffle- So very sad...it's the kind of song that plays when you're feeling hopeless and alone...

            Pfft,  the Alucornus aren't goddesses,  they're just beings of great power.  They have natural powers which are far surpassing those of every-day ponies.
<p></p>However... I do believe that every pony is born with a sort of unwritten energy within them.  An energy which manifests itself entirely once the pony's abilities reach fruition.  *Nod-nods.*
<p></p>Every unicorn has the innate ability of levitation,  and while most of them have levitation of objects geared towards their mark,  a practiced unicorn could use it to cast spells,  (like... from a book!)
<p></p>Pegasus are able to manipulate clouds like cotton candy?  Sounds feasable.  So are the birds in Equestria,  aparently.  I'm willing to bet any creature with feathery wings is able to.

            @Pegasi: Not just pegasi and birds,  but all flying creatures have been shown to possess the ability to stand on clouds,  as seen in that one scene from May The Best Pet Win. A butterfly,  a wasp and a bat was seen perched on the clouds too,  if I'm not mistaken. Also,  Gilda was able to do the same thing. Taken together,  it can be believed that all flying creatures share this ability.
