            Pinkie theme is go!
<p></p>I'd been wondering why Pinkie was the only one who knew what the parasprites were and how to get rid of them. The last episode indicates she wasn't raised in Ponyville (And neither was Twilight,  but Rarity was so where'd she get the accent from?) so it occured to me that she must have encountered them in her old home.

            I joined the Pinkie bandwagon.
<p></p>That actually is a good question about Rarity's accent. Maybe her parents had a really thick accent and she picked it up from them?

<p></p>Rarity: So how was Manehattan?
<p></p>Applejack: Oh it was just awful. Everyone was all proper,  you had to wash before <em>and</em> after each meal. They talked to gosh darn fancy. And if your clothes weren't the most fashionable you might as well not done exist! I tell you... Rarity? Where'd you get that suitcase?
<p></p>Rarity: There's another one upstairs! Help me pack,  I know where I'm going for the summer!

            Maybe that has something to do with where the rainbow comes from.
<p></p>Maybe that's why nobody's done a sonic rainboom (enough to make it the stuff of legend). Nobody's had a rainbow mane and tail like Rainbow Dash in the longest time. The tail is what flares up and leaves the rainbow trail.

            Regarding parasprites and Pinkie's backstory.
<p></p>Parasprites are likely not exclusively native to the Everfree Forest surrounding Ponyville,  since it was implied that they were infesting Fillydelphia. However,  they do appear to be rare occurrences if we are to believe Celestia was genuinely ignorant of them. In any case,  Pinkie was the only one immediately familiar with them,  so living in Ponyville definitely wouldn't have helped her find out.
<p></p>Now,  she's mentioned that since she was a little filly she's ice skated and was taught by her grandmother to laugh at her fears. That doesn't seem likely to have happened before getting her cutie mark,  so it seems to me that her parents thought it might be best for her to go live with her grandmother when it was revealed that being a "rock farmer" wasn't her calling. Her grandmother might not have lived in Ponyville,  but if that's true,  something in between must have motivated her to move to Ponyville.

            I dunno,  it seemed to me like Celestia knew what the little buggers were,  but feigned ignorance (and found a handy excuse to postpone her visit) to save Twilight Sparkle the humiliation.

            Nobody wants to embarass themselves in front of royalty. Or in front of their friends. Especially not both. And having your honored guest arrive in a disaster zone is probably <em>very</em> embarassing.
<p></p>Also,  I have a hard time believing Celestia not knowing what a parasprite it. Even Pinkie Pie knows what they are,  and she's not even a hundred years old (probably).

            Well she's... Pinkie.
<p></p>And I don't think they're going for levels of subtlety that deep in a children's cartoon. My general rule of thumb for this series is that something is true if it's obviously implied to be.

            I'll grant you that... reservedly. I mean,  they could have written that detail for the older audience (the parents,  presumably),  or something. But okay,  I'm not going to deny <em>that</em> possibility.
<p></p>Still doesn't explain why Celestia wouldn't know about parasprites after ruling Equestria for more than a thousand years. That by itself just seems too implausible (barring further explanation as to why she'd be clueless about them).

            I'm not arguing with you there.
<p></p>It's unlikely we'll get an answer,  but I figure it could be explained by Parasprites being a very rare and foreign species (maybe from the same place Zecora came from,  since she knew about them). Celestia only rules Equestria,  and there are parts of the world that are outside it. It could also be the case that the species is a very new one.
