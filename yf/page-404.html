            Yet we still don't get as much action as the main MLP thread.
<p></p>I saw a Team Fortress 2/Portal redub of "Luna Eclipsed" called "My Little Team Portal 2: LunatOS". Can't remember much about it,  but from what I remember I can present something resembling a plot summary.
<p></p>It's Nightmare Night and everypony's having tons of fun. However,  Princess LunatOS (voiced by Potato GLaDOS,  AKA PotaDOS) has appeared to warn them that Ponyville is going to explode for some obscure reason. But Medic Pie and everypony is afraid that she is a Spy,  and they completely ignore her. Twilight Soldier decides to clear her name by trying to convince everypony that she is not a Spy,  but a robot,  with some help from Heavyshy and Apple-Engie. Their efforts soon turn out to be fruitless,  thanks to the cowardly Medic Pie.
<p></p>And then suddenly,  just as LunatOS warned,  Ponyville exploded. They got better,  of course.
<p></p>The premise is just so silly that I can't keep a straight face.

            Well,  I guess that's what happens when you mix together Team Fortress 2,  Portal and My Little Pony. There were two other videos that came before that one that featured Nightmare Moon as GLaDOS and Discord as Wheatley.
<p></p>I never found out why they withheld the new episode last Saturday. Does anypony know?

            Some time ago,  I wanted to make a pony of an Aquanaut from one of my playthroughs of <em>X-Com: Terror From the Deep</em> called Nuclear Sandwich. He was one of my favorite soldiers,  mostly because I thought the name "Nuclear Sandwich" was just frakking awesome. I can imagine him as a pony wearing a suit of Magnetic Ion Armor (with two shots of him with the helmet on and off) and equipped with a Sonic-Blasta Gun and M.C. Disruptor.
<p></p>Couldn't imagine him without the armor,  though,  mostly because you never see X-Com soldiers wearing anything besides their default outfit or Personal Armor. As for his Cutie Mark,  since he was a squad commander (if memory serves),  I think it would be some sort of military decoration.

            That's food for thought!
<p></p>Or maybe they change in accordance with their rank as they progress.
<p></p>Now I can't help but think that there is some sort of caste system in Equestria.

            I find it strange that there just happens to be a pony with a special talent for just about anything.
<p></p>Also,  some more lore from my story.
<p></p>I originally intended to make the Alicorns related to Unicorns somehow,  but I now had the idea of making them the Equestria equivalent of High Elves or some sort of enlightened race. I admit,  it is very difficult to work with something that has been frequently established as a godlike entity.

            Alicorns were not listed as one of the three tribes in Hearth Warming's Eve,  and really,  we only ever have seen two of them,  both more deity than normal pony,  so - I don't think there even is such a thing as an Alicorn people. There's just Celestia and Luna.

You have three tribes of ponies who couldn't work together until they faced the windigoes and ended up founding their own nation (Equestria).  Where do Celestia and Luna fit into it?  Did they just show up out of nowhere and say,  "Yoink!  Equestria is ours now!"
<p></p>I doubt that's what actually happened,  but my question remains,  where to the Princesses fit into the founding of Equestria?

            Well. The flag of the new Equestria already clearly shows Celestia and Luna - but that's not shown in the retrospect but on the actual theater,  so it could be an anachronism. In any case they were not yet leading figures.
<p></p>Personally I like the idea that they only came to the forefront in the fight against Discord. They banished Discord using the Elements of Harmony,  and from then on became active and public in mortal affairs. So in a way they might just have said "We take over now, " but the people were probably glad about the defence against Discord,  so... and clearly some institutions remained: I'm sure Prince Blueblood is a descendant of the Unicorn royal line. Later the Alicorns had their little dispute during which Celestia used the Elements on Luna. Before Discord they might already have been mysterious divine figures or not,  there's really no telling,  but in any case they clearly did not intervene in mortal affairs yet.

            I hope we get the answer (even if it's at the cost of millions of fanfics crying out in terror and being silenced) at some point,  even if it's just a short flashback or history lesson. I mean,  we're getting dragon world-building in an upcoming episode.
<p></p>Oooh,  an idea. The season finale is going to have this Princess Cadence alicorn character,  right? And it'll be a two-parter. Perhaps we'll learn more about alicorns then.

            For God's sake,  it's a show originally intended for 6-year-old girls about colorful ponies learning the ins-and-outs of friendship and being a decent person/pony. There is no need for people to get as worked up and obsessed about it that they have flame wars over a 20-minute-episode involving buffalos.
<p></p>Similarly,  the flame wars about The Mysterious Mare-Do-Well just mystified me. And they make the rest of bronydom look insane.

<p></p>Well,  theirs alot of debate over wheather the mane 6 were mocking Dash {Particularly when they were talking about how great the mare-do-well was infront of her}. Some people say that they didn't take how well she'd react into consideration. Then there's the fact that they didn't try to talk to her about her ego problem before deciding to go with the mare-do-well idea. And then some people say that Dash was a little out of charector,  and that she'd beecome nothing but a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt monkey</a> since this episode came out,  rather then the badass she was back in season 1.
<p></p>Trust me,  I could go on about this.

That was a complaint that a friend of mine had about that particular episode,  too.  It didn't affect me all that much,  since I feel like I've seen that particular plot before on so many other shows.
<p></p>I have to agree with Accela: People need to stop making such a fuss about a show that's intended to be watched by young girls.
<p></p><em>Dear Princess Celestia, </em> <br><em>Today I learned about</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GIFT" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GIFT">GIFT</a>.</em> <br><em>I learned that sometimes,  when people feel really strongly about something,  and they have no way to release their anger,  they like to go to a place called "The Internet",  where they can remain anonymous and not have to answer for anything mean or spiteful they might say.  They just don't seem to realize or care if they hurt someone's feelings.  However those people have to remember that,  just like them,  the boxes of text that they find online are people,  too.  We're all people. (Well,  except for me and my friends.  We're ponies. ^_^)  But the one thing we share in common is that we all have feelings,  and sometimes those feelings can get hurt.  Everyone should remember to take that into consideration when they post.</em> <br><em>Your faithful student, </em> <br><em>Twilight Sparkle</em>
<p></p><em>P.S. - Personally,  once I got past my initial astonishment and embarrassment,  I thought that the picture that Tara Strong posted of that pony who looked an awful lot like me was pretty funny.</em>
