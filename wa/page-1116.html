            I can't buy into "Cupcakes" because Pinkie Pie <em>canonically</em> has never shown the slightest inclination of that sort of behavior.  Given how ready she's willing to forgive <em>everyone</em> who wrongs her,  and her strong disdain for "secrets and lies, " the only way for a person to buy into the fic is for them to be cynical enough to believe that <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotDumb" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotDumb">nobody could be that pure</a> <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">and optimistic.</a>

            Yeah Cupcakes really doesn't make sense to me either.  I just can't see Pinkie Pie as the serial killer type.
<p></p>Also,  considering her abandonment issues I just can't see her going down a path that would lead to her eventually having nopony to party with.

            Of course she's not a serial killer. This is a kids' show,  not Happy Tree Friends. I wish I could write for the actual show,  but then I might be in trouble for poking around at some of the fanfics (none of which I really liked/ Comic Book Guy)

            At least Trollestia has something of a basis in canon; you can't deny that Celestia enjoys messing with people a bit and the first episode did show her to be something of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a>.  Whereas cupcakes!Pinkie has pretty much zero basis in the show except for that scene in <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartyOfOne" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartyOfOne">Party Of One</a>,  and even that didn't really give me any serial killer vibes as much as "Okay,  now she's off in her own world".  It was creepy,  but that was because it was sad to see the most upbeat pony be horribly depressed,  not because she was at all dangerous.

            Not to mention the scene from A Bird In The Hoof,  where she tricks the Cakes in dumping tea everywhere.  She definitely has a mischievous streak,  and Trollestia is an exaggeration of that.  Whereas Cupcakes has pretty much no basis whatsoever.

            Ginger: To be fair,  the Gala was really only truly ruined by Fluttershy.  Twi spent the whole night with Celly and they were just talking when they walked in.  Rarity would have been perfectly fine if not for Blueblood,  and let's be honest here,  any of the mares there probably would have been at the end of their rope trying to deal with Blueblood.  Dashie was being a bit of a show off,  sure,  but she caught a statue that could have rolled and hurt somepony else.  The only reason things went badly for her after that was none of those doofuses in the room thought "hey,  let's help the mare that just stopped that heavy statue from crushing somepony out."  Pinkie was being annoying,  but none of the Gala attenders had much of a problem ignoring her.  AJ was just trying to sell food,  albeit in probably one of the stupidest ways possible (she really should have known better than to just try to set up a stand without making arrangements) and she was mostly harmless as well.  Fluttershy,  on the other hand,  brought in an animal stampede.  And let's face it,  who would have expected sweet little Fluttershy to end up being the most problematic?

She wanted them to attend the gala with the express purpose of livening it up. She was doing it primarily for her own benefit,  since SHE was the one who found it boring,  and she didn't really take into account how the OTHER guests would react to their shenanagains.

<p></p>It's just as much their party as the mane cast's,  if not moreso considering they were in the majority. If the cast didn't like it then they should've just left.
<p></p>I dislike the: "Oh they're jerks,  who cares what happens to them" argument. The still have the right to enjoy their party dammit.
<p></p>A single film snob being invited to a star trek convention by his mate who runs it and spends the entire evening bitching about the fact that they're watching star trek all the time deserves no sympathy. (okay that analogy doesn't quite work,  but it's still  kinda represents what I'm getting at)
