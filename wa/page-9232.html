            @ Kegi,  except if not for her,  far far far more ponies would be dead. Either way ponies would die as a result of her diecision,  she choose the one that would only reuslt in a single,  very very much not innocent pony ding,  instead of dozens of innocent family
<p></p>also keep in mind circumstances,  not 3 days before this they found a little fillie orphaned,  alone and driven to a completle psychological breakdown because she saw raiders led by this pony they are killing slaughter her parents in front of her.

            Also,  Core Moral Principles. She wasn't going against them,  she accepts violence if there's no other way,  that's her character development. Growing away from blindly not doing what she knows is necessary just because it involves violence.

            @Seraphem: That's what I meant by 'take responsibility for your actions'. There is a situation in which killing is the only option. Yes,  I understand that,  despite being a pacifist myself. But I'm a firm believer in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlaceForMeThere" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlaceForMeThere">No Place For Me There</a> in a situation like this. the only,  repeat,  the ONLY situation in which it is acceptable for a pacifist to engage,  or help engage in murder is one in which it is immediately followed by said pacifist coming to grips with what they've done,  and being willing to accept that they are now part of the world they are fighting to remove - and everything that includes.
<p></p>On the other hand,  if you have a token pacifist teammate,  keep them pacifistic. Would it have been so hard to come up with a different plan? For her to not get involved? Clearly they were all going to be gathering there anyways,  how hard could it have been to set something up?

            Yeah,  the fact that just walking away wasn't even presented as an <em>option</em> is kinda stupid. You can say that they had no choice all you want,  but a good story will at least acknowledge those "bad choices" and explain why they can't/won't do them. FE dropped the ball there.

            But they were <em>already gathered there</em>. If they're already there,  why does she even have to do it? Pip knew where the hit was,  she could have taken them out while they were waiting for Velvet to perform.

If the only way is to sacrifice your ideals,  then fine. But know that you are no longer representative of your ideals,  and you cannot exist in a place where those ideals rule anymore. Not until you atone for what you've done. A man fighting for ideals he cannot himself uphold will never win the battle.

            @ kegi,  yes it would be that hard they were on a massive tie crunch,  and pip made the plan on the fly,  and they were stuck with it. and as ginge said,  it's part of her CD that she DOES slowly come to terms with the neccessity of violence. and also it is made clear that her needing to do so is NOT a good thing,  but just one more sign of how f-ed up the Wasteland is.

            Eh,  for the part of the character growth I'd put a pacifist in a "kill or be killed position."
<p></p>Then derail them for a bit,  give em a heel-realization,  then have em balance pacifism with aggression.

            @kegi because Deadeyes wouldn't have allowed them to gather if he hadn't SEEN Velvet there first.
<p></p>The plan was also arranged so that the killing had to take place at a very specific part of the performance,  otherwise the group would've collapsed in on itself and caused anarchy

            @Pannic I never saw her as a hpocrite (at least not consciously) but I DID dislike her on the drugs.
<p></p>Personally,  I LOVED it when she got oof them,  when she finally notices how much her actions have been making her friends suffer

            @Chad: ...A situation of kill or be killed would be a terrible place to put a pacifist,  if you want them to have character growth out of being a pacifist. A better situation would be a situation of kill or a bunch of people die,  such as he/she is in a room next to a gun,  and someone is about to hit a button to launch a bunch of nukes at major population centers.
