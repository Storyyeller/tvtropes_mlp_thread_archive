<p></p>...maybe the episodes <em>are</em> shown in order,  explaining why the autumn ceremony is shown in the episode immediately after Winter Wrap-Up - most of the lessons in the intervening time are fairly minor,  so they didn't merit episodes of their own.

            At least a hundred?  It looks closer to 60 to me... oh well. =)  I'm sure someone will use dimensional analysis to find out Spike's average circumference and use it to see how large that pile is,  and all that.

            I estimated 100 because the part of the heap closer to Twilight looks like it's fairly piled up. 60 would be my estimate if it was relatively flat.

            keep in mind that nothing says Twilight sent ONLY one per week,  she'd just never gone MORE then a week without one,  there could have been weeks where she sent two or three messages to Celestia.
<p></p>Also saw the Rarity switch coming,  not sure exactly what it was that made me notice,  but I do know it was during the egg carry that I suddenly went,  "That's Rarity."

The fact that she had to check implies that this is the first time she's gone that long wihtout one,  further implying she did normally send them more erratically then every seven days,  but never going more then 7.

            ^^That makes sense - at least one letter a week,  with no minimum time constraint.
<p></p>So it really could be any length of time,  depending on how often Twilight sends letters - the most we can say is that it's not <em>more</em> weeks than the number of letters after the Nightmare Solstice.  And since Spike is still burping letters when Twilight leaves...

<p></p>also @Japanese Teeth just read the reviews you had up,  very nice,  pretty much summed up the way I thought about the episodes,  few minor differences,  but over all very nice.

            Since we now talking about time what was between s1 begining and s2 begining  I have questrion where (when) put Lunar Eclipsed?  Or when Return of Harmony hapen.
<p></p>LE showed propably first Twilight Nightmare Night in Ponyville  and first Nightmare Night after Luna return.
<p></p>Twilight wasn't aware of fact that Pinkie goes T&amp;T.  And Luna is not aware of anything about NN,  and it maybe her first apperance in public (at least outside Canterlot).
<p></p>If NN hapen in same part of year what  Halloween this mean that LE hapen in midle of s1 before Winter Wrap Up.  But if it hapen  in diffrent part of year (between winter and summer)  this can after  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoH" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoH">Ro H</a> (horever Luna improving her image and social interaction in less time after her return make more sense).

            ^Actually,  that makes a lot of sense.  The Summer Sun Celebration takes place on the summer solstice,  which is June 21st.  Assuming Nightmare Night is Halloween (and really,  there's no reason not to make that assumption),  and since Twilight doesn't know that Pinkie trick-or-treats (meaning that this is the first Nightmare Night she's spent in Ponyville),  that means that Luna has been back for four months at most.  That's much more believable than the idea that she's spent the last year in Canterlot.

            @Kuroi: I thought the same thing about the absence of the rest of the cast.  I'm fine with the fact that they didn't have any speaking parts,  but none of them were even mentioned.  You'd think they'd at least get mentioned,  or that Fluttershy would be in the stands cheering or something.
<p></p>Re: Spike: There's also the fact that Twilight might have sent stuff other than Friendship Reports in; like just little things informing Celesita of what's going on in Ponyville or amusing anecdotes about what mischief Pinkie got into this time.  Then Celestia figured it couldn't hurt to send those too.

            Just because they're friends doesn't mean they're always going to be at every event together.  Besides,  the Sisterhoof Social was a family thing.  I usually don't drag my friends along on family picnics and the like.  The only one I'm surprised wasn't there is Twilight,  since it was a good opportunity for a letter to the princess.

            I also agree.  Although I do think that the non-shaded gives the picture a sort of "storybook" feel.  In this case the shaded one looks better,  though.
