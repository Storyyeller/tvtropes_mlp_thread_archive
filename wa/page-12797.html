The teen dragons were immune to lava,  but not immune to phoenix fire. An adult dragon would presumably have a greater fire immunity,  but we don't have any evidence of how far that immunity goes. We also don't know the full extent of Celestia's firepower. So any attempt to definitively rank two complete unknowns is going to make us look very silly.

            Of course. But I'm not just talking about adult dragons,  but their royalty. But it's just headcanon of course. Like Badwolf,  I think that each race has their own equivalents to alicorns. Some of which are far  more powerful than alicorns. Draconequii (yes,  more than one) for a start (though I think that Discord is the strongest Draconequis).

            Why wouldn't dragons have a civilisation? According to the map they've got lands. In Dragon Quest we see they've got some culture and do events together.

            All evidence suggests that they are solitary and fiercely territorial,  with the exception of the Migration,  which is probably just mating season. A society would require the sharing of wealth and knowledge,  but dragons are greedy hoarders by nature.

            Dragons who are greedy hoarders above all else appear to become bestial in nature. All dragons we've seen have suppressed that instinct dominating their lives. I'd say that implies they'd have a society,  otherwise why suppress it?

            @Bad Huh? Every single dragon we've seen has been a greedy hoarder except for Spike,  and even he has possessive issues and relapses occasionally. A group of like-minded altruistic dragons could probably form a society,  but they'd be exceptions rather than the rule,  and there's nothing to suggest that they exist.
<p></p>EDIT: I just want to say again that I don't have any issues with people's headcanon,  but if we're arguing facts and evidence,  then headcanon can't come in to it.

            @ Lurker: No,  in SOME Spike becomes bestial when he hoards,  most likely because unlike other dragons he wasn't taught not to let that urge dominate his life. In Dragonshy,  Owl's Well and Dragon Quest all the dragons are clearly sapient.

            Being sapient doesn't mean that they weren't greedy hoarders. I never argued that they weren't sapient.

            @ Lurker: But are you arguing there's a difference between Spike's and their behaviour? Because look at how strong Spike became when he gave into his impulses. If dragons only cared about themselves why wouldn't they do the same?

            I don't think he was disputing their sapience,  just pointing out that all the adult dragons we've seen thus far seemed to be fiercely territorial and prone to hoarding wealth.  Even with the teenage dragons a lot of their games and such are simply emulating those sorts of power struggles.  Just because they're sapient doesn't mean they aren't generally predisposed to certain types of behavior; in this case isolation.  They probably do have some sort of culture,  but I'm guessing it's a lot less social than that of the ponies.
<p></p>As for Spike,  he's either a different subtype of dragon,  or being raised by ponies did something weird to his development.  My personal theory is that dragons can mature in different ways.  They can either do what Spike did in "Secret of my Excess" in which they give in to hormones which jumpstart the process but leave them as far more brutish and bestial (or it's just a phase that they natural progress out of before maturing normally) or they can take the slow path,  which tempers the greed a bit more.

            Really,  all the dragons we've seen are Spike,  one that didn't watch where he slept,  one that tried to kill an intruder and teenagers. We don't have much to infer out of the teenagers,  and the rest are very different among themselves,  so we can't really say much.

            @Bad Spike didn't stop being sapient when he was on his rampage. He was clearly able to plan and adapt. And what happened to Spike wasn't as simple as just "giving in",  otherwise he would have transformed plenty of times by now given his poor impulse control. What <em>did</em> happen is up to headcanon,  but it's irrelevant to the current debate.

            On this I agree completely with JT. I actually think that there are <em>many</em> ways for a dragon to mature whch will affect how they eventually end up. I even think that Spike's fantasy from A Dog and Pony Show is something he is capable of growing into (admittedly,  this is mostly me thinking,  "because it'd be cool!")

            @ Lurker: Being able to adapt doesn't mean he was necessarily sapient besides you can quite clearly tell the difference between Spike and the other dragons in that state Spike couldn't speak,  all other dragons we've seen can speak and it quite clearly was giving into the instinct to hoard because we're told that in the episode.
<p></p>I still don't really know how you could argue against dragon civilisation. They quite clearly interact. We've seen a total of two dragons other than Spike who weren't with company. Dragonshy's,  who was sleeping so it was unnecessary to have company,  and Owl's Well,  who is clearly an outlier since unlike all other dragons he attempted to kill a baby for being in proximity to him. The fact that all dragons don't turn out like Spike did means they must be raised to not be like that or they wouldn't know not to act like that so they must have family units at the least.
