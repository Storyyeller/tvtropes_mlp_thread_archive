            It's like Zapp Brannigan and Kiff times three!
<p></p>From Return of Harmony: "Discord is the mischeivious spirit of disharmony. Before my sister and I stood up to him he ruled Equestira in an eternal state of unrest and unhappiness. Luna and I saw how miserable life was for earth ponies,  pegasi and unicorns alike,  so after deiscovering the Elements of Harmony™ we combined our powers and rose up against him turning him to stone." So,  Discord had to have come after the events in the play because Equestria wouldn't have been called that yet. Guy probably lived there before the ponies came and was all like,  "Get off my lawn!" Or maybe he came around later. What I can't figure out is where Celestia and Luna came from. How exactly do you make an alicorn?
<p></p>Discord and the Windigo's probably know of each other,  both of them are spirits of disharmony. Discord loves to cause mischief and the Windigos feed off disharmony and use it to generate cold. As to why they're still around,  they're spirits,  ghost-like entities without a corporeal form. How exactly do you stop that?
<p></p>On a related note,  I just saw the Powerpuff Girls christmas special. During one scene you get a look at Santa's Permanant Naughty List™ and one of the names on is was Ryan Faust. Is this Lauren's brother?

In their powerlessness they prayed for a saviour to arrive and protect them from their cruel overseer. With all of the ponies praying as one the unified magic we see at the end of the play kicked into overdrive and created two Alicorn fillies who,  with the aid of some of the pony's greatest heroes; Starswirl,  General Hurricane,  Smart Cookie etc,  would grow up to craft/find the Elements of Harmony and defeat Discord.

            Think about it,  The Windigos NEED Discord. If they freeze all their sources of food,  they'll need someone to make more. That's where Discord comes in,  and as chance would have it,  the windigos would have uncovered all the places that Discord would have the most fun corrupting (the countries that are natrually harmonious)

            Yeah but the Windigo's are still around now even without lots of disharmony. They obviously don't need it to survive. Alternatively,  they live somewhere else where there is constant disharmony of some kind but their constant snowstorms aren't detrimental to the ecosystem.

            @Will,  top o' the page: I'm still going to go with my primordial gods/old souls theory. Discord is one of the primordial spirits who first made the world,  similar to coyote of native american myth. Extremely powerful,  likes to dick around.
<p></p>Celestia and Luna are old souls,  immensely powerful ponies whose souls bonded to the flow of magic after their death,  and were eventually reborn and bonded to an element (in this case,  the sun and the moon). They're still ridiculously powerful and nigh-immortal by pony standards,  but no match for a <em>true</em> god like Discord without some help.

            Maybe after being struck by the original friendship beam,  the Windigos became severely weakened and now survive on very small amounts of disharmony (people argue every day even in Equestria). The windigos have become "dormant" in a way. Still alive,  but no longer an active threat unless something REALLY unharmonious happens. Something strong enough to make them ACTIVE again.
