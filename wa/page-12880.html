            Nothing much happened,  other than me establishing a more solid base,  and feeding a useless migrant to radscorpions before sending in my actual military of one earth pony mare with a pitchfork and one with a chainsaw. Surprisingly,  it was the pitchfork pony who killed both radscorpions,  while ms. chainsaw took a claw to the leg and ran away like a coward before the first one died.
<p></p>After this I'll have to figure out how to work the spell researching system,  build a more decent military to prepare for raiders (a few thieves and child snatchers have shown up,  but ran away,  except the one that got stomped flat by my radioactive cows) and organize the 30-something migrants that just arrived in a single wave. Fun times.

            Well,  word of Sibsy is that they or at least she,  wanted to make Berry Punch the town drunk,  even before the fanon about it came out,  in fact she intended the very scene that started to fanon to be an even more obvious hint at it but it got rejected. So at least some of the showrunners think there's alcohol in Equestria

            I've always gone with the headcanon that they don't have booze in Equestria,  largely because I took Faust's "nopony approves of boozing it up" to mean that. I think someone else might've said something to that effect,  as well.

            ummm,  wait,  her saying "nopony approves of boozing it up" would mean that they would have to know what boozing it up was,  or how could they not approve? Seems like,  alchohol exists,  and is just soemthing to relax with,  nothing any pony minds,  but getting drunk is frowned on.

            You cannot disapprove something that doesn't happen because one of the components simply doesn't exist. So,  the fact that it's frowned upon implies there is booze to do it. That's how I see it.

It more or less makes it clear what happened to Lightning Dust and what it means for Rainbow Dash,  and it doesn't change the events of the episode at all since it was just cut for time,  so I'm willing to take it as canon.
<p></p>In summary,  Lightning Dust was reprimanded and demoted to Wing Pony. She had realized what she was doing wrong after a bit of an attitude adjustment. RD completed the course at the top of her class,  which means that she's a top prospect for future recruitment,  but isn't a Wonderbolt just yet.

            @Seraph It's two parts of the same ending,  not two different endings. And it's not really an <em>alternate</em> ending,  either,  just some additional exposition that was cut for time.

            Anyway,  think it was a bit to soft on Dust for what she did,  but to agree the medal and not yet a Wonderbolt but near the top of their recruitment list part being the most likely way things worked out.

<p></p>AJ spends the whole episode forcing everypony to do stuff they don't want to,  and at the end,  decides to solve the problem by making them raise a barn...

            It sounds more like a deleted scene than an altnerate ending. Anyway,  I think we should consider it canon unless for some reason it ever gets contradicted. Likewise,  I consider the Rarity scene in Luna Eclipsed to be canon too even though it got cut.

            A real shame that they have to cut that part. The ending was the one part I didn´t liked of the episode,  especially because it turned Lightning Dust into a villian for no reason. Hve they kept this she will have been much more likable and get a better story arc. Also it finally answer my doubts about the status quo,  basically it doesn´t change. Dash still tried to be a Wonderbolt but the show will most likely never get to that.
<p></p>Like I said,  a shame they have to cut this.

<p></p>I'm going to agree with the RD finishes the course,  gets the medal and is on the top of the future recruits list part of that.  With regards to Dust...I don't know.  That seems like getting off too easy for reckless endangerment.
