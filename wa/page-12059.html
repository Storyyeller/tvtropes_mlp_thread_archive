            I imagine that Cadance did it one day as Shining got home from work to glomp him,  then she thought it was fun so they made a game out of it XD

            My main reaction: Woah,  Shining Armor threw Cadance!  I was kind of surprised that happened,  given that Cadance was so tired,  but I think I also partially forgot that she could fly until her wings came out,  so throwing someone who can fly is different than if she couldn't.
<p></p>I think it was interesting and I liked it in general,  although I think the Discord stories were my favorite opening because his type of chaotic villain is like something I would make up.  I do think this was interesting from a sociological perspective,  by having what I originally thought was going to be just a traditional fair turn out to be something the Crystal Ponies did to literally preserve the safety of their society.  That would be like if the ball didn’t drop on Times Square on New Year’s Eve,  then the new year would never come or something.  Or if it was powered by people’s hopes for the coming year.

<p></p>I thought it was really stupid. Cadance was exhausted,  practically dead on her hooves.
<p></p>Rainbow Dash was right there and is close to being the fastest flyer in the world. She should have caught the heart and Spike before Shiny even had time to grab Cadance.</div>
<p></p>I was highly disapointed at the lack of RD too. She also could have helped a lot with the stairs.

            Rewatching the episode in HD.
<p></p>I noticed there was a bit of jitter cam during Twilight's OCD freakout at the beginning. Also,  when Twi throws the quills and Spike catches them in the bag,  the quills move so fast that their points poke through the bag's bottom. Nice.

I don't think she knew where the spire ended,  so taking a guess could have ended in a big fall to the top of the staircase or being encased inside.

            During the livestream,  a commercial for GAK (which consisted roughly of people saying GAK a whole lot) aired a <em>lot</em>.  Like over the course the episode there were probably over a dozen GAK commercials,  often in clumps of 2 or 3 in a row.  Needless to say,  people latched onto it.  Some of it amusing (like the pic that David linked,  or the other things that actually use it for a legit joke),  but as usual,  some people decided to run it into the ground via mindless repetition.

            @ JT
<p></p>I enjoyed it!  I'd agree with what others said around here,  that it wasn't the 'deepest' episode...and some elements could have been explored further...<em>but</em>...it was different to what's been done in the other two openings...and there was enough gags and tender moments to make me happy.  Seriously...I saw the disguise...and the horn playing...Pinkie is more my favorite than ever.  And I think all the girls had enough parts to make it good.
<p></p>So,  yeah...great opening...looking forward to more!

            @Applelight: That's pretty much how I think of it.  It wasn't quite as awesome as some of the other two parters,  but it was still very good. Mainly I wish Sombra had gotten developed more and that they would have somehow cut down on the exposition a bit.
