<p></p>I can see that happening actually. I can picture it being a similar situation to the scene in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillBill" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillBill">Kill Bill</a> with Pai Mei and The Bride (Celestia and Trixie being in Pai Mei and The Bride's positions respectively),  where the cocky student thinks she can beat the undefeated master,  but slowly throughout the fight,  the master shows her how inferior the student really is and that she has much to learn before she can even think about defeating the master

            Actually,  I guess that setup would make more sense with Trixie as Elle,  considering the characters. But there wasn't a fight scene with those 2,  so The Bride will have to do
<p></p>But just imagine a Trixie VS Celestia battle going like this (skip to 3:00 for the actual fight):

            That looks related to northern Shaolin kung fu... he says,  as if he knew anything about it.  I've never seen that movie,  actually.
<p></p>Yeah... Trixie versus Celestia would go something like that.  I doubt Celestia would put Trixie into a magical submission hold,  but she'd definitely gauge exactly how much she knew and then teach her after the fight.

            Well yeah,  I would imagine Celestia would be much more polite and gentle with Trixie than Pei Mei was with The Bride,  considering her personality. But the basic situation would play out similarly. Maybe after the fact,  Celestia would actually take Trixie under her wing (pun half intended) and teach her like Twilight,  becoming somewhat of a rival of hers in the process. This is actually sounding like an interesting plot idea...

            We also saw Pinkie's parents briefly.  But where are Rarity's?  Applejack's?  Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy probably have their parents still in Cloudsdale,  or some other flying city,  but the rest?  Who knows.
<p></p>Though Applejack's may be gone,  since it was Big Mac and Granny Smith who were there when Applejack went to Manehattan.

            Yeah.  I've never really had the opportunity or the the inclination; I'm not a huge Tarantino fan,  but that clip was fairly interesting.
<p></p>Anyway,  that <em>would</em> be interesting,  especially depending on whether Celestia came across Trixie or Trixie came to Celestia (either for teaching or combat,  though she'd have to hold the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> pretty hard to challenge the god-queen of Equestria after the Ursa Minor thing).
<p></p>^Applejack's parents might still be around,  actually.  Appleblossom's way too young to have even been born when Applejack set out for Manehattan,  after all,  though it is strange that Applejack and Big Mac talk like she and Mac are the only two able-bodied ponies for the Applebuck season if their parents are around.  Maybe they live somewhere else,  and didn't want to bring their kids somewhere potentially dangerous...?   Though Ponyville seems pretty frontier itself,  what with the Everfree Forest and all.
<p></p>Rarity's parents probably live in Ponyville; Sweetie Belle doesn't live at Rarity's shop,  and she's too young to live on her own.

            Now I'm imagining some like,  samurai movie style plot,  where Trixie is down on her luck after being humiliated,  and word has spread. So she's really defensive about her abilities,  and when a few hecklers in a crowd call her out,  she challenges them. Then Celestia,  in disguise,  accepts the challenge...

            Well I'm a big Tarantino fan,  so I feel inclined to recommend it. It's definitely not perfect (and not even one of his best movies) and certainly has a lot of things wrong with it,  but it's worth seeing just for how fun and bizarre it is,  and it's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeLucasThrowback" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeLucasThrowback">George Lucas Throwbacks</a> to the old samurai movies
<p></p>As for TVC,  I like to think Trixie didn't learn her lesson. It was implied that she did,  but I like the idea that she didn't more,  because it subverts the idea that in girly/kids shows,  the bad guy always learns their lesson and ends up getting along with the good guys. If she didn't really learn her lesson at the end of BB,  I think her trying to go up against Celestia isn't that ridiculous. Maybe throw in a few more justifications,  like maybe Trixie can't grasp exactly how powerful Celestia really is,  or maybe just doesn't recognize her at all (we don't know that much about her,  so maybe she comes from somewhere other than Equestria or something). Just ideas

            I imagined Trixie going something of a middle route.  She doesn't repent of her pride completely,  but it does cause her to think about it a bit more.  But she wouldn't have the full epiphany until some other event (like battle with Celestia) triggered it.  In fact,  I kinda like the idea of it being a battle against Luna rather than Celestia.  Luna isn't as powerful,  but she could still likely wipe the floor with Trixie,  and she would sympathize a lot more with her.

            Actually that could make sense,  considering how Luna was in the moon for 1000 years and probably isn't as recognizable as Celestia. Maybe Trixie could travel to Canterlot to do a show or something,  and she accidentally picks a fight with Luna through some kind of misunderstanding,  thinking that she's just a regular old pony. Then,  when she finds out that she clearly isn't,  Luna decides to teach her and improve her magic. Soon,  Trixie meets up with Twilight and rubs it in her face that she's getting taught by a princess now too. This could maybe even start a one sided rivalry,  a la Kakashi VS Gai or something,  where Trixie is determined to be better than Twilight,  where Twilight just doesn't really care

<p></p>I can see how they may be around,  but they may not.  The problem is they aren't mentioned at all,  nor are Rarity's and that's just a big gaping hole for both of them.
<p></p>Especially since we met Applejack's family.
<p></p>Of course,  Rarity's sister was also absent for a considerable part of the series (though she was in the background somewhere,  since she showed up in that shot under the table.

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">an outside factor gave Nightmare Moon her form</div>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">No page on Berserk's High Octane Nightmare Fuel can begin without mention of the way that Apostles are made. It starts when somebody that possesses a Behelit hits a moment of absolute despair,  where he would do absolutely anything to escape his situation. When this happens,  the Behelit,  a creepy little egglike thing that has human facial features scattered randomly all over its surface,  rearranges those features into a human face. Which then proceeds to bleed from the eyes and start screaming. Then the angles in whichever area this happened start changing and the Godhand,  the Big Bads of the series,  show up to make the Apostle-to-be an offer. The offer involves sacrificing whoever the Apostle-to-be loves most in order to be reborn as a demon,  which is a way of having the Apostle open himself or herself up to evil. Since Behelits invariably activate at the Apostle-to-be's lowest point,  that means that this offer sounds very much attractive,  particularly if the friend or loved one to be sacrificed was the cause of the Despair Event Horizon in the first place. If the Apostle-to-be accepts the offer,  the Godhand mark the person with the Brand of Sacrifice and what happens next is often a truly horrific death as the other Apostles eat him or her alive.
<p></p>And things only get worse when it comes time for a new Godhand to be born <em>[which Luna definitely has the potential to be]</em>,  which happens once every 216 years during what is known as the Great Eclipse. A very special Behelit makes its way into the hands of a very special individual. This individual,  a charismatic leader of men,  achieves great things during his lifetime,  but then things start going straight to hell for him,  culminating on the day of the Eclipse when he loses all hope and activates his Behelit. When a Behelit of the Godhand activates,  the bearer and everyone currently present with him is transported to the Nexus,  a nightmarishly surreal place that to mortal eyes is a scene right out of hell itself. Instead of just one or two victims like is the case with Apostles,  the Godhand demand that everyone the Godhand-to-be has led be marked for sacrifice in order to become one of their own — and instead of just a good number of monsters,  every Apostle in the entire Berserk universe has gathered for the feast,  and comes out of the woodwork to eat everyone alive once everyone is marked for sacrifice.
