            Alright Over Analytical Cap ON! I meant the fact that the green beam was associated with the changelings love siphoning. Using that spell along with Celestia's love for her people gave the queen a boost.
<p></p>This is noticeable during the scene when the camera zooms on to Celestia's face,  then back to the queen's. The queen's horn glows brighter before her beam overpowers Celestia.

            @Enlong I think she intentionally waited until she'd heard the Queen's speech before making a move so she would know the full scope of the situation. She was gatherig intel,  you don't make a move before knowing what your enemy is doing. Besides,  I don't think they could've reached the elements anyway,  they would've needed Celestia to open the door. I think her sending them there in the first place was so that they could fail and again make the queen even more sure of her victory.

            It glows brighter because more power's being fed into it. More power siphoned from Shining Armor's love,  that the queen didn't realize was there.
<p></p>The simple explanation is that Chrysalis didn't realize just how <em>much</em> power his love would give her.
<p></p>Edit: But the "false sense of security" ploy is such a rookie plan,  that can go so very wrong so easily. If Celestia is a schemer,  I like to think that she's better at it than that.

<p></p>And think what would have happend had she beaten the Queen?
<p></p>SA would still be mind trapped,  the Changlings would still be invading,  and everything would still have been a cluster fuck. Sure,  with time they could still have set everything right but it wold have cost much more then it ended up being.
<p></p>What really needed to happen was SA needed to be set free so he could cast his spell and the only was to do that was through <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a>,  which for Cads to get close enough to try on SA The Queen would have to be convinced she had won.

            Celestia falling was downright <em>traumatizing</em>. Seriously,  it left me <em>gaping</em>. Maleficent,  I mean Chrysalis,  somehow managed to make a long self-introduction while holding the floor all to herself,  with celestia nowhere on-screen: honestly,  I thought she had pulled a fast one again and just left the premises,  but then she actually fought.
<p></p>And lost.

            @Ginger: The thing is that losing to the Queen when she could have won is entirely counterproductive.  If she can take out the villain herself,  there's no need to lull her into a false sense of security.  Deliberately throwing the fight arguably makes her look <em>more</em> incompetent.  Her first priority is "eliminate the threat to the nation"; having the opportunity to do so and deliberately passing it up would be a startlingly bad call.

            @Enlong I think she was making do with what she had available to her. If she beats the queen,  good,  she gets the elements,  hands them to the mane 6 and they purge the city. If she fails then the queen becomes cocky.
<p></p>I also think that she had Luna sleeping outside the city,  so even if the "get her cocky" plan didn't work Luna would've seen the danger when she came back,  and would've gone to warn others

            Sometimes,  one doesn't have so many irons in the fire that losing is some convoluted path to victory. Sometimes,  one just fails.
<p></p>Again,  I ask what would be the point of allowing Chrysalis to win that fight? I can see no plan that would not be better off with an unconscious Chrysalis and an unrestrained Cadence.

            @JT No. I don't think she intentionally threw the fight. I think she entered the fight knowing that she would most likely lose,  but there was a chance that she wouldn't.

            Yes,  but with the largest direct threat out of the way,  it frees up everyone else to go help out with the invasion.  And as noted,  she's the one preventing Shining Armor from casting his spell; without her control over him negated,  it would probably be a lot easier to get the shield back up.  And it's not like Cadence and SA couldn't have used <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a> in the exact same way they did in the show; the only difference is that the Queen is already out when the spell goes off.
