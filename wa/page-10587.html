            I just found that establishing that the audience's general views and expectations of a character were actually exactly the same as the general views and expectations of the character in-universe before subverting them was brilliant writing.

            Equestria,  as I see it anyway,  is just starting to see the large returns of steam power. Most trains in Equestria are steam powered,  with the exception of the one from Over a Barrel that I can't remember. In my personal headcannon that is actually the last train line that is still run by good old pony power and the rail guys are proud of it. The only other thing that seems to be steam powered is the Flim Flam brothers jusicing machine and that seems to be a custom job. So I don't think motor vehicles are around yet,  or if they are they're all expensive luxury items owned by people like Blueblood and the like.

            I tend to think of Equestria as being around turn of the 20th century or so,  so to my mind Cars are a ways off,  but not TOO far. Heh. I recall readign a short story where the nephew of the couches-and-quills pony invented it. He was called Ottoman... so he named it the Otto-mobile.
<p></p>As for the oddity of tourism... my thoughts on it are,  the tourists are coming to look at the base of operations for the element bearers! Of course they don't know who the element bearers ARE,  since that would disrupt their lives rather considerably.

            I don't think that you can equate the technology to any particular time period,  since Equestria lacks the wars that drove our own technological advancement and has magic to reduce the necessity that would drive invention otherwise. That's why you don't see much outside of trains in the area of transport,  but you see more modern things in the realm of entertainment,  like arcade machines,  movie projectors,  and spotlights for stage shows.

<p></p>I suppose so.
<p></p>@Mio: Yeah,  I noticed that,  but we do agree on some things. Besides,  I knew that you disagreed with me on a lot of things from previous conversations anyway.
<p></p>EDIT: From your bottom tier,  I suspect that you dislike over the topness,  which is something that I tend to like,  so that's something.
