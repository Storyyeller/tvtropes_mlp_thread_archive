<p></p>In before fanfic about a changeling who made friends with a pony and chose to assume her friend's identity to "keep her alive" after her friend gets killed in an accident involving Everfree megafauna.

            i dunno the nature of evil is an interesting concept in fantasy works. I also love redemption stories too,  so when the to go hand in hand I'm hooked.

            Nature of evil as according to Granny Weatherwax is seeing others as things and not people. Redemption begins when you stop doing that and try to make up for your wickedness.

            I don't know about an urge to be "evil". That's far too nebulous a term to be usable. Urge to steal,  maybe. Urge to be murderously violent,  possibly.

            Take for instance the Black Dragon Flight Warcraft. Basically their leader was corrupted by an outside force and because so all his decedents are violent megalomaniac brutes. Save for one egg that after constant purifying experiments removed whatever it was that cursed its forefather.

            @Chad: Weeeeeeeell The Colour You Bleed deals heavily with what it means to be bad,  and the concept of redemption.  Not quite the same as 'what is evil',  but it does at several times dissolve into a discussion of the value of things an morality,  and in one chapter the main characters do discuss just what it means to be 'bad'. In essence they come upon the conclusion that the only men who are truly evil are the ones who don't realize they're doing something wrong; the moment you realize you are wrong and try to stop,  you are no longer a bad person.

<p></p>Rarity is apparently a martial artist. Did she start learning alongside Dashie or something?
<p></p>@Chada: She kicks a Manticore in the face in the Season 1 pilot,  lays out changelings with mean hooks,  and strikes some serious flank-kicking poses when Discorded in Return of Harmony. Maybe she takes combat aerobics to keep her svelte figure.

            I' m not quite certain what you mean... That the persons mind basically never wonders if they're wrong for hurting people? In that case even if they can't be called 'evil' they're still very fundamentally ill.
<p></p>In the terms that it's <em>portrayed</em>,  the difference between good and evil is compassion. When it's said outright the question is whether the protagonist,  Blueblood,  can still be a good person after he's basically made everyone around him miserable,  and it's stated that the fact he recognizes he did so,  and feels guilty,  is the reason he isn't as bad as he thinks. In practice the 'good' characters all feel actively guilty about something,  or seek change in themselves. Blueblood feels guilty about the way he treated his servants,  his mentor feels guilty about all the ponies he's killed in the past,  etc. The villains,  meanwhile,  show no signs of remorse or compassion. Each one of them only cares about their own goals. It's the capacity to think of others that separates them. In that case the inability to consider one might be bad - the inability to cinsider you are hurting somepony,  and you should stop - is what <em>makes</em> them bad.
<p></p>In another sense the difference between good and evil could be said to be the willingness and capacity to change versus complacency,  but that's a different question entirely and not necessarily a moral one.

            I'm of the opinion that a mind that doesn't allow for that kind of realization is a mind that can't process emotions at all. And if that's the case,  you can't even be said to be <em>evil</em>,  just very very dangerous to be around.
