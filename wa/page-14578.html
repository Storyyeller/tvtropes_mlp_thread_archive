            Ironic? Really? I'm afraid that I do not know anypony named "Lightning Dust". At least not ponyally. I could tell you about Lightning Dust the Glittery,  Lightning Dust the Spectacular,  Lightning Dust the Agile,  Lightning Dust the Defiant and Lightning Dust the Rapid,  though. They were all pegsi of history and should be more well known.
<p></p>I must say that I am also grateful for the oppertunity to study the Crystal Heart that I was given while here.

<p></p>While there have been rumours that Star Swirl the Bearded became romantically involved with Princess Celestia after the death of his wife,  this is rather unlikely as Princess Celestia was very young at the time.
<p></p>EDIT:<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Unfortunately,   Twilight Sparkle,  Bearer of the Element of Magic has blockaded the entrance to the pool and I need to apply directly to Princess Celestia to study it,  which I haven't had the chance to do yet. It is possible,  gven it's location,  that it was an accidental creation caused by a clash of Cosmic magic,  but I've been unable to confirm so far.

            Depends. If you could make food more delicious...
<p></p>Although given how it worked in the episode,  you'd probably get something back with a greatly enhanced flavor,  but none of the nutrition.

            I didn't get to study the clones,  Japanese Teeth. Unfortunately they refused to sit still while I tried to check their vitals. And I did not see the watching paint dry test.
<p></p>Well,  kegisak,  she would have been an adolescent at the time. While Star Swirl the Bearded was in his fifties when they first met. While such a relationship <em>could</em> have occured,  it is not probable.
<p></p>According to Pinkamena Diane Pie,  Bearer of the Element of Laughter,  Steventheman,  the Mirror Pool only works on those who say the rhyme,  which food can't do. ... Unless you are a carnivore or something.
