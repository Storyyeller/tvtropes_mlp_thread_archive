            Being paralysed in a nightmare happens to me often,  but I'm not sure what that's called.
<p></p>@Applelight: Yeah,  that's the reason that I say that as much as I'd like to marry a girl like Fluttershy,  the beggining of our relationship would be incredibly awkward as I'm pretty shy when it comes to new experiences (the personality test nailed me as Fluttershy myself). But I become more boistrous among those I know well. That's why I say that of the Mane 6,  Fluttershy is the one I'd most likely have long term happiness with,  Twilight's the one I'd enjoy the early dating with the most (the problem with Twilight is that I'm a slob and her OCD nature would clash with my...sensitivity to being controlled).

            Dear Princess Celestia:
<p></p>Today at breakfeast,  my wife told me when she started to see the pilot of MLP:FIM with me,  and first heard about "Elements of Harmony",  she thought immediately: "oh my,  this series gonna suck,  every single episode they'll fight some menace and defeat it at the end with those elements!"  or something like that in Brazilian Portuguese.
<p></p>Your faithful student,  Osias Sparkle.

            I see a lot of people's age guesses putting Fluttershy at the top and Pinkie at the bottom. If that were true,  then the whole of the mane 6 are essentially the same age,  considering Fluttershy is only one year older than Pinkie. I honesty find that to be a bit farfetched,  considering that when Rarity,  Fluttershy,  and RD were already in school,  Twilight hadn't even started magic kindergarten yet. I consider Twilight to be the youngest,  with AJ being the oldest,  and the others being somewhere I between with at least a few years between AJ and Twi. Of course,  it's all fanon,  really.

            Sunday...Okay. Point. I posted anyway.
<p></p>EDIT:<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I agree that it's farfetched that Fluttershy's the oldest and Pinkie's the youngest but there are several indications that they're <em>near</em> the oldest and youngest. I think that it's pretty unlikely that Rainbow isn't the youngest for instance. And I think that Applejack is older than Fluttershy. But I think that Twilight <em>was</em> already attending school,  just not one for the gifted yet.

            I just remembered,  I still can't believe they named Octavia well... Octavia! Heck,  I'm even more surprised they threw in the relationship with Vinyl or rather DJ-Pon3.
<p></p>And I get the feeling Rarity and AJ are probably the oldest,  Pinkie and RD are probably the youngest and Twi and Flutters are probably somewhere in the middle.

<p></p>First off,  we don't know whether Magic Kindergarten is even real. Second we don't know if Twilight was already in school. Third,  even if she wasn't,  they might do things differently in Canterlot.

            Who ever said that the apples are late bloomers? And what does that mean :P ?
<p></p>As for relationships,  I usually prefer not to think about who of the mane six would fit me better. Why? 'Cause,  in my humble opinion,  a person who's really in love with another one,  should be ready to change a part of him/herself,  even a little but visible one. So no matter if I date with Twilight,  Dash,  Aj,  Pinkie,  Shy or Rarity,  if they really loves me than they also should be willng to change one or two flaws in better,  and I in exchange should do the same with mines. Because love is also a matter of internal growth.

            Made an edit where I brought up similar points to Storyyeller. Personally I believe that magic Kindergarten <em>is</em> real,  but that Twilight had already finished it and was trying for the next level of her education.
<p></p>EDIT:The <em>Apples</em> said that they were late bloomers. As for the whole changing thing,  I disagree,  but let's not get into that.
