            Yeah,  on a ten point scale I'd give this a 7. Not bad by any means,  but it felt a bit less polished than the Discord episodes in terms of characterization.  I think part of it is that a <em>big</em> chunk of the episode went toward exposition about the Crystal Empire,  which meant they couldn't spend as much time on characterization.

            These crystal ponies must have a very low range of vision if they didn't see the sky keep turning all evil throughout the episode.

            Going by what I've seen and what you've said,  I'd say,  at the very least,  we'll see more of the Crystal Empire. Letting all the exposition go to waste doesn't sound like something the writers would do.

            It amused me,  therefore I enjoyed it. Yeah,  there's some wasted potential,  but I still enjoyed it :V
<p></p>It would be interesting it that's not the last we see of Sombra,  especially given certain things in the Spoiler Thread. (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">coughcoughtrixiecoughcough</span>)

            <div class="quoteblock">  I think part of it is that a big chunk of the episode went toward exposition about the Crystal Empire,  which meant they couldn't spend as much time on characterization. </div>
<p></p><span class="blue">Ya know,  I think that was a bit of a problem as well.  They spent all this time trying to establish what the Empire was like,  and in the end it's just like Ponyville,  but with sparkles.  Nothing unique or interesting about it at all.  About the only difference is that they like jousting.</span>

            Indeed,  I can already think of some ways that they might incorporate him into that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Like Trixie absorbing some of his magic for her upcoming duel with Twilight.</span>
<p></p>@Blue: Yeah,  I think my biggest issue with the episode is that it spends a ton of time talking about the place's history,  when it ultimately isn't all that different from places that we're familiar with.  Like with some minor tweaks to Sombra's backstory,  they could have set the entire thing in or near Equestria and not had to spend the time on it.
