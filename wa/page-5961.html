            Now that I think about it,  Pinkie really <em>did</em> have a good reason to name the bakers her prime suspects at the outset. Her conclusions and scenarios,  though,  were just plain batty.
<p></p>Ginger,  what did you think of the hat-switching thing? I know you were worried about Pinkie being the Sherlock figure.
<p></p>Personally,  I'm a bit annoyed that the hat situation switched,  because on second thought,  Pinkie and Twilight make a very good Holmes and Watson,  if you're going by the original setup. Watson was actually very bright,  and Holmes was nearly too strange to function,  at times.

            OK,  watching the episode:
<p></p>Wow,  how much does that cake weigh for Big Mac to struggle to lift it?!
<p></p>So,  the cake isn't for the wedding then... Ah well,  its no loss.
<p></p>It seems Celestria isn't only one who loves cake. Looks like is setting up everyone as a possible suspect.
<p></p>That griffon (new griffon!) is so evil. He has a evil French accent and everything.
<p></p>I don't think anyone expected the return of Doughnut Joe... also,  he has an evil laugh.
<p></p>It looks live everyone has motive... from sabotage to hunger.
<p></p>Pinkie so did it. Calling it now.
<p></p>Is it just me,  or is Pinkie paranoid? No just this episode,  but others as well.
<p></p>Pinkie isn't good at guard duty... It took her about 1 sec of intense focus to dose off.
<p></p>Actually,  I'm calling the driver as who did it now.
<p></p>Pinkie as Sherlock and Twilight as Watson? This can only go badly...
<p></p>Oh god,  I cracked up at the old timey film part... (what is is referencing,  I'm sure there is a specific film like this...)
<p></p>Now James Bond references?! Oh god,  the shipping,  I can see it already... Especially with that scene with him and the mares... (THAT SWAG!) Also,  I loled as his face when he heard that Rarity thinks he would look dapper in a Tux.
<p></p>And now ninjas. Why not? (This is probably referencing a film as well...)
<p></p>Damn it Pinkie,  your making me hungry,  and everyone else on the train... Hmm... The cake was the only one she described before...
<p></p>And now Twilight is in charge. Much better.
<p></p>Wait,  so It was FS,  RD and Rarity? didn't see that coming...
<p></p>And now the backers were caught too. The only good ponies there we Twi,  Pinkie and AJ.(honesty FTW!). And the driver too.
<p></p>... Pinkie is so going to the moon now...
<p></p>So,  final thoughts. Not as predictable as expected! (I was wrong on both guesses -_-). Also,  so many references! A good episode over all. No flaws that I can think of. Now to catch up on the thread!
<p></p>(also,  holy crap,  this post is long XD)

            Honestly I thought Mulia Mild was <em>way</em> worse than Gustav. Mulia's voice annoyed me when she spoke,  but Gustav had <em>class</em>. Dude was carrying around a spotlight for the sole purpose of bragging about his <em>eclairs</em>. I can get that shit at a 711 for a buck 50,  and he had a <em>spotlight dedicated to his</em>.
<p></p>He's like the showman of chefs. I respect that.
