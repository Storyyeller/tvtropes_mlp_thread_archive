            I've actually started watching the show on TV since I'm up anyway and it lets me watch with my sister.  Plus I've bought a fair amount of pony merch.  And I'll be buying the comics if I can ever be assed to head out to a comic shop.

            The thing is that I can't immagine many people willing to pay money to see the documentary. I guess anyone who would already contributed to the Kickstarter.

            Techinally,  Disney bought more than Lucasarts,  they bought LucasFILM,  which includes Lucasarts :P
<p></p>The only reasons for Disney to be interested in Hasbro is that Hasbro makes Marvel &amp; Star Wars toys,  in in that case they would more likely wait until Hasbro's rights to make those toys expired and then they go to someplace that Disney does own,  like what's happening with the Star Wars comics.
<p></p>But that's a tad off topic.
<p></p>Remember the documentary was originally just gonna be <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDeLancie" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDeLancie">John de Lancie</a> at Bronycon. They wanted to make it better. Also just because something met its goal on Kickstarter doesn't mean its going to cover everything. There's some indie games that have been using Kickstarter not to cover the whole production of a game,  but for other things like helping them through the final push or marketing money.

            The kickstarter funded everything needed to be paid for. But a lot of the people in charge and others took defferred salaries. They weren't paid at all,  and were taking there salary from the money made afterwards.
<p></p>Though,  I will admit as messed up as it is,  some of that is due to them making the digital available so far before the physical one. And the digital distribution setup they used having so many flaws. You get X number of downloads,  period,  and if your download gets interrupted,  you have to start over and it burns one of your downloads. Plus,  the majority of people that really wanted to see it already had a copy becuase they donated to it.

            The other problem is that it's inherently a niche audience since most bronies will probably already know most of the stuff in the documentary. It's aimed at nonbronies,  but they're not going to pay to watch it.

            Yeah,  I think the main issue is that most bronies simply don't have enough interest in the documentary to be willing to fork money over for it.  Case in point,  while I'm interested insofar as I'm curious about how it turned out,  I've been in the fandom long enough that I don't really have any reason to watch it beyond that.
<p></p>I'm much more likely to support the show by buying merchandise for it because there's no way of getting it otherwise.

            @Morning Star:  It's not like they need a reason.  Most of the worlds are just there for the crossover value,  very few of them tie into the main plot aside from the villains popping in to cause trouble.

            I think that that reddit post's thing in Season 4 was supposed to be the lack of Derpy. But that's a moot point now,  because the poster of that post <a class="urllink" href="http://redd.it/17j9lp">posted<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/17j9lp/season_4_the_goodbadugly_redux/c86f48f">again<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (spoiler warning,  though only a bit more spoilery than his original post) at the end of last month,  saying that he doesn't work on <em>MLP</em> and that his original post had a lot of speculation that he made based on what he <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowsAGuyWhoKnowsAGuy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowsAGuyWhoKnowsAGuy">was told by his friend who claimed to have a friend who had talked with Hasbro about the future of MLP</a>,  supposedly:
<div class="quoteblock">* <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alicorn Princess Twilight</span> was confirmed for the season finale
<ul><li> Season 4 was a thing
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Characters that didn't fit the "theme of the show" were going to be removed or phased out. Derpy and Pinkamina were mentioned as characters that didn't fit,  with hints towards "crazy twilight" ala Lesson Zero.</span></li></ul></div>
It's of course unknown whether the first two points were anything more than just <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt">lucky guesses</a>; as for the third point,  what the heck would <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pinkamena being removed or phased out</span> even mean,  given that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pinkie had already hardly ever been like that</span>?
