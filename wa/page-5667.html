            Indeed.
<p></p>Yeah,  overall it was pretty good; I thought the resolution was kinda weak though.  But still,  lots of good moments,  and it was nice to see the CMC take it upon themselves to fix things.
<p></p>@Absol: Same here.  I'm kinda surprised they didn't do that as part of their apology.

            don't think it was <em>weak</em> per say,  just a bit rushed,  which again is due to time constraints. Still a great episode.

            Big Mac is really sensitive about his hobbies,  I guess?(this episode has given me an idea for a sort of alternate continuity fic where the CMC accidentally outed Big Macintosh with their paper,  and him having to deal with all that entails - which would <em>really</em> give him a reason to be angry.)
<p></p>Also,  I love how Pinkie's revalation/breakdown went <em>completely ignored</em> by her friends. I wonder how often it happens.
<p></p>Also,  the return of Pound Cake and Pumpkin cake was great. Did Carrot Cake still have his stubble in that scene?
