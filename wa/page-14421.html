            For some ideas for my first fic,  it's <a class="urllink" href="../wa/page-14404.html#post-None">on this page.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<p></p>I only have some basics for my second. Las Pegasus is basically a more idealistic version than the original. Ponies only ply games for fun,  or small prizes at best. Unicorns use their magic to power dazzling light displays and fireworks at night.
<p></p>But not all the city is so sublime. In the further districts,  it's closer to the real world version. Drugs are sold to unsuspecting fillies and colts,  corrupt police take bribes for favors,  and cheating and corruption are wide spread.
<p></p>To stop the spread of such corruption,  certain police are chosen and trained to handle the darker side of the city. They do their best to keep crime down and arrest the criminals so an unaware public never learns the truth.
<p></p>I have three basic character templates,  though no names as of yet.
<p></p>The first is a Earth Pony officer who's been in the business for too long. Most of his friends and partners have died over the years,  his wife left him over the strain of his job and not being at home,  and he's giving into cynicism and hopelessness.
<p></p>The second is a young unicorn who comes from a wealthy family in Manehatan. His  stay at the Stirrup has been a fun one,  but one night after drinking one too many shots of cider,  he's mugged by a seemingly friendly mare and left wounded and bitless in the gutters. He's found and taken in by the reluctant first character to his home where he can get a place to stay long enough to get a job so he can buy a ticket back home.
And the last is basically a ponyfied Faye Valentine. She's a pegasus who regularly does whatever she feels like for the thrill of it. She regularly steals,  cheats,  and breaks into casinos for fun. Because she likes to be in interesting places,  she'll work on both sides of the law if it'll benefit her. She's just as likely to give a lead on a crime lord to the police as supply said lord with the police's investigation on him.
<p></p>I only have a very basic plot for the story. There's a conspiracy in the government and among various criminal factions. Using dark magic,  the leaders use them to increase the natural negativity and greed of more wayward ponies for pure power and material gain. The slow but steady increase of the darker elements in the city were deliberately engineered not only to go under the radar of the princess's notice,  bbut to spread corruption so that the city will be ready for complete take over.
<p></p>The story will follow the 3 protagonists and a supporting cast as they investigate and slowly uncover the conspiracy. And eventually work towards bringing down the authorities to make the city truly safe.
<p></p>You guys have probably left or lost interest at this point,  orry the summary's rough,  had to retype it 4 times so it's not as well put as I'd like. But that's more or less what I've got.

            So this is totally out of context,  and has nothing to do with anything,  but the Unreal Engine can SUCK A DICK and learn to deal with the fact that sometimes people make mistakes(Usually because of it's stupid control scheme) and neat to use its undo function without it having a freaking meltdown and crashing!

Moon you want to be mother,  <br>But you canâ€™t love a man; you will not find a man! <br>You are not like the others,  <br>Why do you need a child,  you are not a woman? <br>Ah,  ha,  ha,  ha/ Ah,  ha,  ha,  ha <br>Baby of the Silver Moon
<p></p>Of the man of brown skin <br>Was born a son,  <br>White like fur of ermine <br>The only one,  <br>White baby with grey eyes <br>For Gypsies to despise <br>For his father to hate. <br>Woman was beseeching <br>That there was no cheating <br>But it was far too late!
<p></p>Moon you want to be mother,  <br>But you canâ€™t love a man; you will not find a man! <br>You are not like the others,  <br>Why do you need a child,  you are not a woman? <br>Ah,  ha,  ha,  ha/ Ah,  ha,  ha,  ha <br>Baby of the Silver Moon
<p></p>Gipsy man felt disgraced by his own wife <br>Furious he ran home holding his knife! <br>How could you betray me? <br>Now you must repay me,  <br>And he stabbed her to death. <br>Then he took the infant,  <br>Climbed up rocky mountain <br>Laid him there and left.
<p></p>Moon you want to be mother,  <br>But you canâ€™t love a man; you will not find a man! <br>You are not like the others,  <br>Why do you need a child,  you are not a woman? <br>Ah,  ha,  ha,  ha/ Ah,  ha,  ha,  ha <br>Baby of the Silver Moon
<p></p>When the moon is full and itâ€™s shining bright <br>Itâ€™s because her baby is now all right <br>When the babyâ€™s crying <br>Moon is pacifying <br>Him; Sheâ€™s a cradle for child.</div>
<p></p>Okay,  now the events in that video make a bit more sense.  So,  it's basically a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustSoStory" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustSoStory">Just So Story</a> about why the moon waxes and wanes?  That's pretty neat.
