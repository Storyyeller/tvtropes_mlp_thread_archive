            @Princess - Due to your avatar I actually thought you posted here.
<p></p>Honestly,  thought,  welcome. Don't worry about being insane and whatnot; it's not like you will see what you haven't already seen in other corners of the internet.
<p></p>Maybe except certain discussions on pony anatomy.

            Actually,  I'm really pleased with the way Fighting is Magic went down. Yes,  we're denied an incredibly awesome game,  but it put the team in the position,  both skill-wise and publicity-wise to make an awesome game of their own. If any of those guys are planning on getting into professional game making,  they've now got the best resume fodder you could hope for,  and that's assuming their new game <em>doesn't</em> make a critical splash.
<p></p>Welcome to the thread,  Princess.

            Has anyone just had one hay of a depressing day? Sorry to bring in some negativity,  but I've been informed by doctor that I've only got about 4 months of useable vision left. It's not much to begin with,  but I've always hoped for a breakthrough or surgery I could try before the inevitable. I've been struggling with depression these last few years and although it's gotten a little easier,  this really isn't going to help. Again sorry,  I just didn't know where else to go,  you guys are pretty much the only friends I've got. Thanks for putting up with me and being welcoming these last few weeks.

            Sorry to hear about all of that,  <strong>darkabomination</strong>. My day hasn't been exactly thrilling or anything,  but it hasn't been awful either. I hope what I just sent you by PM brightens your day a little.

            Yes,  a warm welcome to anyone here to that might be new to me,  also. I'm afraid that without new episodes,  my reading of this thread tends to be very sporadic at best.

            I'm sorry,  darkabomination. My mother went blind as well (well,  that and paralysed. She had Multiple Sclerosis.) That said,  while I can't remember a lot from back when she could see,  I still cherish the time I spent with her,  including the time she was blind.
