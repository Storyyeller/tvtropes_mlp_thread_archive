            Sad because they hadn't gotten to really know each other despite being around for years in the same town? X3 That does sound sad. Not to mention extremely improbable.

            Well if we look at in terms of age,  with Rarity likely being in her early 20s and Sweetie Belle around 9-10,  its possible this is around the first time the latter's wanted a closer/deeper relationship with her sister.

            It would be probable IF Rarity had moved out of her parents home after Sweetie bell's birth or while she was still a baby.

Even if my sibling had been born after I moved out and I had no interest in seeing him or her,  I'd inevitably spend SOME time with them and wind up getting relatively close. If Rarity lived far away,  maybe,  but she lives in the same town,  and Sweetie probably comes over to visit often.
<p></p>I'm gonna subscribe to the theory that this was simply the first time that Sweetie had actually tried to get a closer relationship with Rarity.

            It would make sense,  especially given that Applebloom has likely talked at length about her sister,  and hearing about how close those two are could have made Sweetie Belle wonder why it wasn't like that with her and Rarity.

Swetie bell did  show signgs of admiration towards Rarity before this ep.
<p></p>Maybe Rarity only viewed her more as a kid/baby than her sister<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess"> until this episode now  they are tuly bonding and are bit more closer to each other (equals)

            Well,  we do see Sweetie Belle hanging out at Rarity's shop and annoying her in another episode (I think it's the beginning of Stare Master).  My thought is that Rarity has been living on her own for long enough that she views Sweetie Belle as a sort of intrusion.  And it's not just a clash of personalities,  it's that Rarity has a business that she's trying to run and work that she has to do,  and Sweetie Belle is rather severely hampering that process.
<p></p>@Count Dorku: Oh,  I understand.  Kinda.  After putting up with him for six hours a day for a month,  I can't even comprehend the idea of having live in the same house with that sort of thing.  I mean,  I'm sure I'd get used to it eventually,  but eaugh.  Don't get me wrong,  I love my cousin,  but he gets on my nerves incredibly quickly.  I could only assume that siblings would be similar only moreso.  *shudder*

            Can we all just agree that Rarity-in-the-rain is huggable and kissable and leave it at that?
<p></p>You know what,  it makes me wonder how Applejack would look after standing in the rain for awhile.  That's what would boost her popularity right there (although,  I think those ponytails she sports are cute in and of themselves).

            @J-Teeth: To me,  the definition of a sibling until either you or they turn at least fifteen is someone you could hug 75% of the time and strangle the other 25. And I would be willing to bet they found me at least as annoying as I often found them. Luckily,  we're all 18+ now and can get along for days on end without one elaborate murder-related plot! Truly,  maturity is a wonderful thing.

            I'm late to this sibling discussion,  but Rarity not getting not getting along with Sweetie Belle is in no way indicative of how strong their relationship has been in the past.  Sibling relationships don't work along the lines of fight for awhile,  then come to understand each other,  then everything is fine.  It's more like you get along for awhile,  then you get in a huge fight over something stupid,  hate each other for awhile until either you make up or,  more likely,  enough time passes that you get over it then you get along until something else irrelevant happens that pisses you off.  There isn't some magical 'now we get along' moment.  So I don't thing Rarity's failure to understand Sweetie Belle means they haven't had much contact.  It just means that siblings are sometimes blind about what the other one needs.
<p></p>This is one of my longest posts ever and no one will read it because it's the middle of the night.

<p></p>Yep.  And I'm fine with that,  as long as it doesn't result in episodes of that style becoming more common.
<p></p>And <em>what</em> does this have to do with finding ways to make Applejack look adorable and/or sexy?
