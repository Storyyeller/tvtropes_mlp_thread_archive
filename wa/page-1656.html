            I suppose they can always get really generic jobs. But even then,  they're obviously going to get overturned by somepony who actually has a cutie mark relating to that field.
<p></p>I have to imagine they managed to get <em>some</em> push towards a craeer that suits them,  though. The only one I have to wonder about it Seafoam - her mark makes me think of marine biology,  or something. Not a lot of jobs for scientists in a small town,  unless there's something really damn cool in the pond of thiers.

            I think Rarity combined her skill with her hobby. If she didn't make clothes,  she might've used those jewels for something else.
<p></p>Also,  I propose we call colts' cutie marks "macho marks".
<p></p>What is Applejack's skill anyway? Growing trees? Tending animals? Selling apples?

            Yeah. Her mark didn't appear when she found the cache of gems,  it appeared when she saw the results of her work. It represents her love of beauty,  particularly creating beauty,  much more than it does the actual gemfinding skill.
<p></p>On the other side of the coin,  Twilight had already found her passion of learning and the field of magic before her mark showed up,  apparently triggered either by her bout of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a> or by her becoming Celestia's student.

            I think the thing is that the symbols are largely symbolic - Cherrilee's has nothing to do with teaching,  on the surface. It's all about personal association. A lightning bolt doesn't have much to do with racing - but a rainbow pony wanted to move as fast as lightning. Likewise,  Rarity's mark is likely because she realized with the advent of the jeweled costumes that she wanted to make designs that <em>dazzled</em> - and she associated that with the gems she found.
<p></p>As with Twilight,  I think it was that she loved learning,  but she didn't quite realize that she could make a life out of that. then when Celestia offered to teach her,  she knew she wanted to learn really great magic from her,  so bam! cutie mark.

            @storyyeller: That's true,  but I bet he at least gets nervous if he sees Apple Bloom near the stand!  Although he was lucky he missed the part where she was purposely putting apples in other ponies' bags so it would look like they bought some.  I honestly don't know much about <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorWho" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a> aside from what has been said about it on this site,  so I don't know much about how that would relate to a pony character aside from him being a time-traveling pony.
<p></p>Apple Bloom's behavior in that episode and the latest one made me think of something.  If the CMC could use at least some of the Elements of Harmony,  which ones would fit them?  Apple Bloom might not be honesty like her sister but maybe loyalty would fit her more?  I'm not too sure about Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle.

            Funny enough there <em>is</em> a scene in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorWho" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a> where the Doctor (first episode with <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MattSmith" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MattSmith">Matt Smith</a> I think) says "Apples are rubbish,  I hate apples." This was before Friendship is Magic aired.

            A Rich Reeders post from earlier today,  when my computer decided to act up on me:
<p></p><em>It's not bad once I get started; you've seen what I can do,  it's just there's so much of it. And I can't just say "I quit". How would that make me look?</em>
<p></p>Sane?
<p></p>Seriously,  trying to "Zecorize" the <em>entire first season</em> makes Applejack's task in "Applebuck Season" seem small by comparison.  What you've done so far has come out great,  but you should just think about doing one episode at a time,  in installments or "chapters."   If you feel like tackling another episode somewhere down the line,  then go for it.  I wish I had your talent.

            I wonder if they'll introduce the idea that if a pony doesn't find her special talent before too long,  her cutie mark will turn out to be either just a representation of her name,  or something generic and meaningless like a heart or a butterfly.
