            I just really can't help but imagine them as ex-lovers. In part because I think the actual romance between them would have been something sweet to behold,  and in part because I like the element of tragedy it brings to the table. Plus the sheer levels of fury and disdain that probably exist on both sides... mm...

            I don't really ship seriously,  but the closest I get to shipping seriously is <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppleDash" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppleDash">Apple Dash</a>. If I want to ship Applejack with somepony else,  it's Soarin'. My first ship for this show was Spike x Fluttershy,  but I like him with Rarity as well and after Cutie Pox, with Twilight to a lesser extent. I really like Big Mac x Twilight,  but Big Mac with Cheerilee is good too. After that,  I dont really ''dislike' ships,  but they don't really excite me as much.

            I must admit that some popular ships don't make sense to me. I mean,  I'm all for <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackPairings" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackPairings">Crack Pairings</a>,  but for them to become incredibly popular as a serious ship,  I don't get it.
<p></p>Biggest offender I see is Twixie. They don't even have <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay">Foe Yay</a>!

            @Blue: I just ordered Persona 4 a few days ago. I'm soooo excited to finally be able to play it...
<p></p>@ginger: If nothing else,  you can't deny they have an obvious history. It's more than just a single fight,  too,  Discord did imply a good deal of familiarity.
<p></p>And it's not so much a <em>bitchy</em> ex lover plot,  it's more like... Okay,  I ad once had an idea for a story where a Supervillain fell in love with a super heroine. They had a relationship,  but the villain was a robot so it never went anywhere. The hero left him,  and in his fury he basically went into <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">Let's Get Dangerous</a> mode and showed what a guy with an army of robots at his disposal can do - he razed the city to the ground,  and killed the heroine.
<p></p>That's what I imagine their relationship to be like. It's not so much Discord is some jilted fool,  being snarky and whatnot because of it,  the broken relationship essentially filled him with some sort of righteous,  driving,  all consuming fury to just ruin everypony's day for the rest of eternity. He lashes out at <em>everything</em>,  whether it has to do with Celestia or not - she was the straw that broke the camel's back,  and <em>everything</em> has to pay for it. I kind of like that,  a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaddenIntoMisanthropy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaddenIntoMisanthropy">Madden Into Misanthropy</a> that ends with everything being punished.

            <div class="quoteblock">But it was established that they could do this in the first episode.</div>
<p></p>Second episode,  actually.
<p></p>And I have to admit,  even though I watched the eps in order,  even the first time I saw it the Elements of Harmony and the Taste the Rainbow just felt off.  Even the first time,  it felt like they were trying really hard to jam square pegs into round holes that they simply weren't meant to be jammed into.  That's prolly a large part of the reason I normally say I liked the first half,  but disliked the second.
<p></p>The thing is though,  Nightmare Moon's arc was the pilot episode,  and pilots are prone to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>.  If a concept is introduced in the pilot but then dropped in the rest of the series,  it should be assumed that it only happened because the project was still growing roots.  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a> does NOT mean "this is a perfectly valid concept to bring back later after the viewer has gotten used to something completely different."
<p></p>I mean,  the original Tatsuo Yoshida <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedRacer" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedRacer">Speed Racer</a></em> manga has a chapter where he fights a lava monster,  but nobody says "the manga had a monster,  so its totally okay that <em>The New Adventures of Speed Racer</em> has him fighting cyborgs and aliens!"  Likewise,  try writing a story where Lisa Simpson is a bratty,  reckless,  troublemaking kid and telling people "its in character because that's how she was in the original Tracey Ullman shorts, " and see how far it gets you.  Bottom line is that IMO,  bringing back the Elements of Harmony is just as bad an idea,  as if we brought back Bratty Lisa or Speed Racer fighting lava monsters.
<p></p>Gonna stop here because I keep getting sidetracked writing this post and I need to get done.
