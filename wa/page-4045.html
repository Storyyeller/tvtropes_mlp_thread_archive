            @Fallen: That's true to a point.  But like I said earlier,  there were some points in the episode where even Pinkie should have recognized that she crossed the line,  to the point that it's borderline OOC of her.  Like I could understand her mistaking the toupee for a spider and stomping it.  That's an innocent mistake that's annoying,  but understandable.  Climbing a flagpole and repeatedly announcing that Cranky is bald to the entire town when he's very clearly sensitive about it?  Even Pinkie should have realized that that was going to far.

            Pinkie might have one of the strongest unifying forces in the Elements of Harmony in Laughter,  the one that forges and/or strengthens bonds with shared good feeling. The power to sweep away sadness and fear with Laughter is definitely her greatest strength. Also she's an amazing Bard.

            I reapeat: Pinkie still got what she wanted in the end. She'll still be insistant upon making everypony she meets her friend,  because so far,  everyone IS her friend,  even Cranky.
<p></p>There WILL be people whom Pinkie can't help,  even if she gives them space. (heck,  the only reason she could help Cranky was cuz of her obsessive insanity in the first place) All she's learned is: "If I can't make them my friends this way. I CAN make them my friends in another way." It hasn't solved the underlying problem which caused all this in the first place.

            I should just note that I don't think Pinkie is bad either; I just think this episode didn't handle her very well.  My main issue is that her zaniness was exaggerated so much that the other aspects of her personality went by the wayside.  I mean,  she's so dead set on making ponies happy that you'd think she'd be able to catch on when her actions are having the opposite effect.  I don't dislike her,  I dislike the way that she was handled in this episode.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Yeah.  What it comes down to is that good intentions justify things <em>up to a point</em>,  but there's a line where it doesn't matter what your intentions are.  Even if you want to be helpful,  if you're causing problems you should back off,  because it's a disservice to keep going.

I totally understand why you think that
<p></p>I think that has always being a big flaw of pinkie. She is bad at knowing the feelings of others and conecting with other ponies. The problem perhaps was that the writers uplayed this particuar flaws a bit too much just to be funny undermining the moral in the process.

            @Applelight: I really don't think that that justifies her actions.  Someone who doesn't realize that breaking into someone's house isn't an acceptable way to make friends wouldn't even be able to function in society.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">That sums it up pretty well.  It's like what happened in MMDW with Rainbow Dash; they played up the flaws so much that the character's good side gets lost.  In this case,  they overplayed the zaniness to a point where Pinkie is utterly oblivious.  She may be on relatively good terms with every pony,  but she's definitely had conflicts with other ponies before and should be able to realize when she's offending someone.

            Ginger,  it doesn't matter that she got what she wanted in the end,  because she had come to terms with him probably not being her friend. <em>She actually learned a lesson there</em>. Just because she did get what she wanted,  doesn't mean you get to ignore that fact.

            Oh,  two weeks until next episode then?
<p></p>Jteeth: By the time she broke into his house,  it wasn't a matter of not knowing she was being annoying or anything. She was just too stubborn to quit. Anyway,  is your review out yet?
<p></p>^ No,  she said she learned the lesson. She didn't actually change her behavior at all to reflect it.

Notice how Pinkie NEVER stopped trying to find an apology. What if she hadn't known Matilda. I don't buy for one second that she would've quit
