            I dont like real time chats because I cant read fast enough to keep up with them usually.  Much prefer the forum format.
<p></p>Thats my main reason for not going to Skype chat.

            Why don't I brighten things up with another installment of <em>Pannic Hates Everything</em>?
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Mrs. Cake rushed back to Sugarcube Corner,  desperately trying to think where her husband could possibly be. She wracked her brains,  trying to think where he would be at this time of day. He should have just been there,  doing work like they normally did.
<p></p>"Ohhh dear..." she moaned. "Where could he have gone?"
<p></p>"Honeybun?"
<p></p>Mrs. Cake spun around and saw her husband standing at the door to the cellar. His mouth was drawn back in an expression of concern at his wife's distraught state.
<p></p>"Honeybun?" he asked again. "Are you okay?"
<p></p>"Where were you?" she asked.
<p></p>"Uhh..." said Mr. Cake. "In the basement. I think we're running a little low on frosting,  so we..."
<p></p>"So you haven't been out of the house?" she asked,  walking cautiously up to him.
<p></p>"Well,  not today I..."
<p></p>"So you haven't seen a stallion in a hat and jacket,  have you?"
<p></p>"Uhh... no?" He raised an eyebrow. "Honeybun,  is there something..."
<p></p>And with that,  Mrs. Cake shoved him through the doorway. Mr. Cake fell,  wide-eyed,  letting out an "oof!" as he hit every step on the way down.
<p></p>"I'm only doing this because I love you!" Mrs. Cake called down,  before shutting the door and propping a chair up against it. And,  satisfied that her work was done,  she sat down on the chair and took some much-needed rest.</div>

            You guys do realize that talking endlessly about the drama is quite possibly the worst thing to do,  right?  Needless to say the drama created in the pms should stay as contained as possible.  Even if it makes people curious,  there's no reason to spread bad blood among the posters by telling everybody who wasn't involved what's going on.  The best thing we can do is to drop that issue rather than going over it again every time somebody asks what happened.
<p></p>EDIT: Basically what Pannic said on the last page.
<p></p>I'd also like to point out that I can only remember 4 cases in the entire thread where somebody got banned for stuff they did in this thread.  Of those,  three were the same person,  and the other one turned out to be temporary. For it's length,  the thread really isn't worse than any others.

            @Broccoli: Give it a day or two.  We've had worse drama,  and it usually blows over within a few days.  For what it's worth,  I don't plan on leaving unless it gets locked,  which it shouldn't as long as we stop dragging external drama into the thread.

            I'm with Pannic here.  If anything,  people need to realize that the culture here isn't all that different from other threads,  no matter how much we talk about love and tolerance,  and that understanding is still something people here have to work for.

            What JT and Tutrle said,  just drop it and let it go. This thread is no worse for drama/mod attention then any other for it's size,  it's just so popular and big that more mod attention gets brought in,  but proportionally it's no worse then any other,  it's just the size that makes it seem like more mod attention is needed.
