            From a designers standpoint,  they sort of are. Not their games,  but their corporate structure. Every game is a passion project because they let you work on what you want. You always have a say,  because everyone is equal(though Gabe Newell is <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalFarm" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalFarm">More Equal than you</a>),  you never have to worry about deadlines or executive meddling because they're rich and publish their own games...
<p></p>From a consumers standpoint they make exceptional games but offer poor service for it,  which makes them sort of mediocre as a company.

            Oh no. Oh FUCK no. You don't get to pull card blanche here. Valve have an obligation to their fans. To the people who MADE them successful in the first place. It may not be a legal one,  but in my opinion it's sure as fuck a moral one.

            You know,  it's only been 5 years since Episode 2. I don't think we've quite hit <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWare" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWare">Vapor Ware</a> levels yet. You know what <em>I've</em> been waiting for? A revival of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Marathon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Marathon">Marathon</a>. I have been waiting for it for <em>16 years</em>. And I <em>know</em> that Bungie is working on it,  because their recently revealed contract with Activision specifically allocates 5% of their work force to work on it. I think I can wait a little while longer for Half-Life 3. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            Oh no,  don't get me wrong: Valve does let their fanbase down as far as time goes. They release a good product,  and noone can deny them that. But it takes them way too fucking long to do it most of the time. At the very least,  they shouldn't be announcing a project until it's very close to completion. I wouldn't <em>necessarily</em> say it's worth a lot of rage about - they do it to make the best possible product - but it's a valid issue with them.
<p></p>I just saying that from an artists standpoint,  they're THE company to work for. Nothing more.

            Actually,  to anyone here who is a fan of the FPS genre,  or just likes to see important parts of video game history in general,  you <em>need</em> to play <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Marathon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Marathon">Marathon</a>. All three of them. They're free for nearly every platform known to man,  and the fact that they were made made in the mid-90's means that your computer's specs shouldn't matter in the least,  so there is no excuse not to. It's probably one of the first FPS games to feature a fully realized plot,  with characters that had personalities vibrant enough to be carried by simple text in terminals,  to boot. Not to mention that it invented a lot of the FPS concepts that <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Halo" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Halo">Halo</a> is usually credited with popularizing.

<p></p>uh...isn't that kinda the point of a game being revolutionary? That nearly all games that come after it in that genre use things from it?
<p></p>you can't just dismiss doom like that because marathon came later on.
