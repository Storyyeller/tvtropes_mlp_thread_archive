Hi,  I'm here several hours earlier than I previously discussed!

That was <em>exactly</em> the kind of test that an inspector might want to throw in order to check the city's ability to deal with the unexpected,  I'd say. And it was a test that the Crystal Empire failed,  big time.

            And yet,  they got Cadence ready in record time,  had the city all spruced up,  and had a welcome to the castle ready.
<p></p>Also,  apparently the only distinguishing mark she felt like discussing was the print on her luggage (intstead of,  oh say her cutie mark). No way anyone else could have had a bag with flowers on it.

            The thing I don't get is she picks the city because they were nice to Poppycock. Because she's tired of special treatment due to being the inspector. So by accidentally giving the special attention to someone else and intending to treat the inspector like all the other cities did,  this proves them worthy?

            It was a mistake on HER part,  too. She thought that the treatment Poppycock got was the standard for the Crystal Empire's service,  so she judged the city based on that.

            @Crowfall - I wouldn't blame them. After all,  there are tons of tests where going so far as asking your instructor's name is a mark of failure. They should take <em>all</em> the <strike>apples</strike> caution that they should take.
<p></p>Why,  if I was the inspector and they asked for my name,  I would have immediately scratched the city off of the list. Such a despicable act,  urgh.

            Yeah,  the whole thing was kinda a Sweet and Elite "everyone learned their lesson,  so no need to ruin everyone's day" ending. It wasn't handled as well as it could have,  but the comedy in the episode more than makes up for it to me. Plus,  the fake inspector is one of the most endearing one-shot characters ever,  IMO.

            Hey,  Blissey,  I'm brainstorming for a time travel fanfic right now,  and I'm wondering what's the state of the art for pony stories on that topic.
<p></p>Specifically,  I'm wanting to write a story where the mechanics of time travel itself are the meat of the story—rather than a story where another time era is a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfAdventure" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfAdventure">City of Adventure</a> and time travel is just the plot device to get the protagonist there. Most of the time travel fics I've read from this fandom fall into the latter category,  but are there any stories in the former category?

            I wanted to let you all know that I'm okay...now.
<p></p>I lost power at 8:45 Friday night due to a blizzard.  With the power,  I also lost the heat and the telephone.  I kept huddled under a blanket.  By 12:00 Sunday morning,  the indoor temperature had dropped to 30 degrees Fahrenheit.
<p></p>Long story short,  my sister and brother-in-law came to my house this morning (Monday) to see if I was okay.  I wasn't in the best of shape. Shivering in my recliner under several layers of insulation. Hungry because I was far too cold to get up.  I'm at their house now.  They got their power and heat back sometime during the night.  I've warmed up now and had a tuna melt,  some mac and cheese,  and three cups of tea.  I'm gonna take a much-needed shower soon. I'll ask if they have a spare razor. I kind of look homeless right now.
<p></p>I've since found out that my town may not get power (and gas heat) back 'til Thursday.  And here I was,  trying to tough it out.  I needed to get out of my house TODAY.
<p></p>In other news,  I just watched "Games Ponies Play" online.

<p></p>@Meta Four: Yeah,  you have a point there.  Not that Rarity will ever succeed in integrating herself into the upper class; any more than Rainbow Dash will ever join the thunderbolts.

            Rarity did not really "climb the social ladder" that much,  I think. As a (good) tailor,  she is definitely still middle class.

            @ Kegi: Except Rainbow explained everything to her face that it's not normal treatment. And she'd know it wasn't normal treatment because she didn't get it.

            Thanks,  guys.  My sister and BIL don't know I'm a brony,  so I'll be limited to when I can post.  I snuck in my viewing of "Games Ponies Play" when my sis had gone shopping and BIL was doing laundry.
<p></p>I hope everyone else is doing OK.  I hope anyone else without power and heat has gone somewhere safe.  Don't be stupid,  like I was.
