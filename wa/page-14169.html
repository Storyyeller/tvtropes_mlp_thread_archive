            As odd as it sounds,  Pinkie's explanation for why we don't know how to get you a way to Equestria is actually quite accurate.
<p></p>Without direct knowledge of your world's physics and magical interaction,  it's impossible to figure out how to construct a passageway between the two worlds.  Honestly,  it's rather surprising that the internet connection even works.
<p></p>@Pinkie: Applejack is a perfectly competent baker as long as she isn't suffering from the effects of sleep deprivation.

            Yeah,  for the most part they did quite well with it.  This year I wrote up a plan ahead of time for Mayor to use so I wouldn't have to run the whole thing myself again this year.  For the most part it went pretty well.  Although I must admit I still haven't gotten the hang of using those snowplows.  I think I'll stay away from those next year.
<p></p>@Pinkie: Yes,  it has been quite a while.  I've been busy.

            <span class="evil">   Hey,  everypony. We're taking a short break at this Burger Princess and it has wi-fi,  so I thought I'd give you an update on the trip.   </span>
<p></p><span class="evil">   It's going slower than I expected. Turns out Steven is still a wanted criminal,  so he's insisting we need to take the smaller,  backroads highways. Says the trottobahn has too much risk of him getting caught. Also I do most of the driving during daylight,  so Steve can duck out of sight anytime we see the police.   </span>
<p></p><span class="evil">   "But Sombra!" you say. "Aren't YOU a wanted criminal yourself? Also incredibly handsome?" Yes to both of those,  but I have <em>audacity</em> on my side. Anypony who sees me driving down the highway is going to be too flabbergasted to report me. And if they do report me,  no one's going to believe them. As long as I don't do something stupid,  like rob a gas station,  I'm going to be fine.   </span>
<p></p><span class="evil">   Speaking of which,  every time we stop for gas,  Steve suggests we rob the station. It's getting really annoying.   </span>
<p></p><span class="evil">   Other than that,  not too terribly much to say about the trip. Just a lot of small towns. Jefferton was pretty nice,  though. We had lunch at a hole-in-the-wall diner. Those were the best fried daisies I've ever had.   </span>
