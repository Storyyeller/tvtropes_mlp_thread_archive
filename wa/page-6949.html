            @ Seraphem: Ah. Okay,  that makes a lot more sense.
<p></p>But I think an odyssey would be a really cool episode. It would be kind of long though by default. So maybe the Mane 6 got stranded on a boat and had to use teamwork and get along to get back to land?

<p></p>Actually,  they are in different ages. Apollo is in the Heroic age,  with the other Heroic age dieties being Aphrodite and Dionysus (my favorite). Artemis is in the mythic age,  with the other choice being Hephaestus (who is way cooler). Hera is the third mythic age diety but you never have to choose between Hera and Artemis.

            A Jiin myth could be really fun~~
<p></p>And the "mythology" of some of the Catholic saints could be really interesting too. Sort of like the Hearts and Hooves Day couple that caused the whole thing.

            Don't forget that the Phoenix designs are rather unique as well. It's not quite far-eastern,  but it's almost seems to be a cross between the European phoenix and Asian phoenix. (Or not. I'm not versed well enough in mythology to be sure).
