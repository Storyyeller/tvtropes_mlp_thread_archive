            People say Celestia was holding back during her fight with Chrysalis,  but I am not entirely certain if that's the case.
<p></p>I don't see why there would be any collateral damage. She was firing off a singular beam at a particular corner of the room. Note that it wasn't even the ceiling. At worst there would have been a somewhat large hole. With chitinous bits lying around.

            I dubbed it "Superman: Our Everything is Exploding Edition". Seriously,  I didn't look at who the director was until after,  but I totally wondered if it was Michael Bay about 2/3 in. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>EDIT: Roy: Well,  the theory is that the laser was holding back because it was a weaker attack instead of using a spell that would have nuked the room or something like that.

            @Roy: They only reason I'd see Celestia holding back is,  if in her magic arsenal,  her horn beam is her weakest and would have caused the least amount of damage. She could have possibly held back because she underestimated Chrysalis' power,  and/or has a personal qualms with killing other creatures,  regardless if they're evil.
<p></p>Or,  she decided that this would be a test for Cadence and Shining Armor to see if they're prepared to handle the Crystal Empire.

<p></p>Ska?
<p></p>Well funny enough,  I was thinking of 'theme' music for my crew and one would have ska as his theme of choice.  Something like what <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpecials" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpecials">the specials</a> would play.
<p></p>Another would have a theme similar to that song from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeparted" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeparted">the departed</a>.  The punk Irish folk song.

            Since we don't know have any definitive rules for magic,  it could be anything. I guess one explanation could be that putting too much power into it would turn it into a true mass destructo-beam.

            @Gwen - Dropping the sun on Chrysalis would have indeed undoubtedly caused massive collateral damage on other ponies. However,  saying that her horn,  the thing with which she does pretty much everything,  including moving celestral objects,  is her weakness doesn't sound like a satisfactory explanation.
<p></p>Also,  the latter is just plain ridiculous. A test should not risk national security.

            Ummm,  we don't KNOW what sort of spell it was,  or even if she simply could have pumped more power into that spell,  but might have risked soemthing else happening. It would totaly fit for her to hold back and only do the bare minimum she thought she needed. Which given Chrys' reaction,  would have been enough had she not been pumped up on uber-love.

            @Roy: I didn't exactly say her horn was her weak point— I said her horn beam was her weakest <em>spell</em>. If Celestia has a No Killing policy,  she might have chosen it because it would have caused the least damage to the other ponies in the room and Chrysalis.

            @ Seraph: She knows the Crystal Empire is cursed by Sombra. She knows if Twilight fails Equestria will be filled with hatred and fear. She still decides that she should tell Twilight to do the opposite of what she should do as a test.

            I'm leaning towards the interpretation that Celestia initially did want Twi to save the Crystal Empire all by her lonesome,  and only decided afterwards that "You saved the day but you got help,  so FAIL" was kind of stupid.

            @Gwen - It turns out I did misread that post,  my apologies.
<p></p>Either way,  I don't think it would be logical to say that it was her weakest spell. You have what is essentially an international terrorist revealing itself in a plain sight,  you would probably use something stronger than your weakest spell. Since we don't see any other of her arsenals,  we can't really assume if it is indeed her weakest weapon.
<p></p>This is as far as I will participate in this line of discussion.  There really isn't enough information about Celestia's capacity to make a conclusive judgement on anything.

Well,  it's the director of <em>The Dark Knight</em> producing,  and the director of the modern classic,  <em>Suckerpunch</em>,  directing.
<p></p>Kidding aside,  I saw <em>Man of Steel</em> yesterday and really enjoyed it.

            She didn' know Sombra was still alive and had returned. And I really doubt she really wanted Twi to do it alone,  but rather was setting up a test for her. Again not knowing the Sombra himself had returned.
