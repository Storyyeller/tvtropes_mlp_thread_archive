            I don't mind Pinkie's forth wall breaking since,  as often as it is used,  it is at least a bit subtle in execution,  not just basically calling out it is a cartoon and she can break physics like say,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGarfieldShow" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGarfieldShow">The Garfield Show</a> does. It's not as if other characters don't get in on it too anyway (Spike's constant <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a> sabotages in Lesson Zero for example,  which were equally funny).

            I mean why would you care about the fandoms projection of the character,  more then the actual character?

            secondary @ Ginger,  no one is saying you can't,  all I've seen are people pointing out the fairly massive differnce between a one shot pony and a Mane Cast memeber as far as expected amount of attention.

            I love Pinkie,  but I love her the least out of the mane 6.  Just a little bit less,  though. She only rated three points lower on my personal 40 point scale than Rarity (the highest score) when I tried to rank them.

            I was only aware of the one Dune movie. If there are more I'm certain this is the bigest budget of the bunch. I think it has Patrick Stewart or somebody like that in it.

            @Badwolf: It basically comes down to how much they like the involved characters.  If they like Derpy they won't complain about her.
<p></p>@Will: I don't think <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrickStewart" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrickStewart">Patrick Stewart</a> was ever in a Dune movie.  It would be epic if he was,  though.  I know the Lynch movie had <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePolice" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePolice">Sting</a> in it.

            I admit she is probably the most one dimentional of the mane cast (maybe because she gets the least aesops of them),  though still at least a bit complex. She's not as one note in her antics as Trixie.

            @Ginger:  I was disagreeing with the Trixie haters as well.  The thing is you seem to get a lot more legitimately angry about it,  where as others are just talking about stuff they don't like.

            People can give attention to whoever they want. Why should I care? I can take or leave aspects of the fandom and fanon as I please. Heck,  I'm writing a fic about Scootaloo and Rainbow Dash that all but ignores Scootaloo's flight deficiency aside from a few mentions,  even though that's the first thing most people think of when they think about those two interacting.

            Trixie was only in one episode,  one where she was an antagonist no less. It's not surprising she comes off as one-dimensional compared to other people.

            I have to admit that I find Pinkie's "wackiness" particularly grating,  but I try to stick with a live and let live philosophy Ginger.  After all,  if I spent all my time being angry at the portrayal of a fictional character,  I'd have precious little time to spend on anything else.  Let alone finding anything enjoyable about the show.

            All Applejack does is work on the farm and be stubborn. Pinkie at least has occasional character development (Party of One,  Return of Harmony).

            becuase every single person has there own opinions/likes/dislikes/etc... what one person thinks is boring,  another may love,  what one person sees as overplayed another enjoys,  etc... no matter what you will find someone that will hold any position,  you can't just group up poeple as a whole and say "Well some people said X,  so way don't all of you also agree with Y which is the same" when the group your talking to may not even contain any people that said X to begin with.
<p></p>So just becuase YOU (this is in general not aimed at anyone) do/don't like something or think something is over/under played doesn't mean that anyone else does or that it is,  it is just one persons opinion.
<p></p>If there wasn't a large group of poeple that liked Trixie/Derpy/Fourth Wall Aware Pinkie it would never have been so played up to begin with,  so obviously there are alot that like those and others. If you don't that's fine to,  just don't go ragging on tohers for liking something you don't or liking it to a degree you don't
