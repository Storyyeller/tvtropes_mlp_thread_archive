            For Derpy's "human" name,  I would call her "Danielle" and have the fans refer to her as "Dani" for short.  This way,  it would be plausible that the voice actress for her would have thought they were calling her "Danny" as in the boy's name,  because of the way that Tabitha thought she was voicing a male character at first with Derpy's scene in the Last Round Up.
<p></p>By the way,  for a human Applejack,  Apple is a real surname that could be used for her family.  But Smith also works because of Granny Smith's name in the show.
<p></p>For Pinkie,  I like calling her "Penny" and maybe her full name could be Penelope Diane.

            @Keg,  yeah,  the WPFS is pretty cool. My only regret is I don't always make it there on Mondays due to my reluctance to put myself in social situations.   But last night's movie was pretty awful/hilarious.  I actually didn't mind the alien design,  even if it's pretty uninspired.  It was largely the poor practical effects and inept writing/editing that made the movie though.

            Ah,  I see. That's kind of a shame.
<p></p>There's a theater near me that does something <em>kind</em> of similar,  but it's only with horror movies,  which I... don't generally like. I went to go see the first one they showed,  but only because it was based on <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JohnDiesAtTheEnd" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JohnDiesAtTheEnd">one of my favourite books</a>,  which I know to be largely comedic and surreal besides. I can handle surreal and psychological horror,  it's the 'dudes sneaking around with a knife' kinda horror I hate.

<p></p>Thank you. Yeah,  I took the notes made here and added what I thought it would be like to have enormous power and responsibility yet still stuck in kindergarten for a hundred times longer than everyone around you and have them grow up and old while you are frustrated that you aren't getting to exercise your responsibility properly. And then mesed it intoa character.
<p></p>Hopefully my next alicorn OC goes over well. It'll be a bit harder for him on those two points,  but he's a villian where such things are a bit more forgiveble.

He got it,  but as a result,  He can't leave the Crystal Empire without being turned into a dark cloud,  (And sealing off his magic). Another catch is that his power is tied to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfHate" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfHate">The Power of Hate</a> Meaning that with Ithaqua sealed inside his talismans Sombra would be weakened,  thought still powerful). Celestia and Luna managed to separate him form the empire he took over,  but not before he cursed it to return when he does.
<p></p></li><li> Another idea is that before the story starts proper,  Spike,  The CMC and a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel Face Turned</a> Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon will have dreams involving the Mane 6 (now part of the Elements of Harmony ala <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheJewelleryBox" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheJewelleryBox">The Jewellery Box</a>) for various reason ranging to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> future events and who will inherit the Elements to other things and as the story goes on the connection they have to the elements spreads to the marital world allowing the Mane six to become ghosts of a sort.
<p></p></li><li> On another note I'm considering using a funeral as a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> and add alternate endings that reveal who the funeral is for (One character will be constant in these endings,  but I'm not saying who. The Mane six will also have funerals in most of the endings <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">for reasons that will be made obvious for those that read Punishment's Ending Omega or the above bullet.</a>)
</li></ul><p></p>Thoughts?

<p></p>Okay. Now you <em>have</em> to read <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedakaBox" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a>. He's exactly the sort of character who would fit right in there. (He sounds a lot like Ajimu who is one of the most powerful characters there. She has just under thirteen quadrillion powers but spends most of her time trolling. She's a lot like Discord too. But is more restrained and FAR more powerful.)
<p></p>EDIT: And <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrativeCausality" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrativeCausality">Narrative Causality</a> is an extremely important concept in the series.

            @Sereg: Hmm... that actually does sound kind of similar. Only real difference is the main reason TSWTSU(Or Umbrella for short) doesn't do anything isn't out of any real sense of restraint... more just that his mindset is so warped his idea of doing something often looks like he's just screwing around. The main reason the other gods don't want to deal with him is because they just never know if he's going to help their causes or go against them. The only one of the gods whose even gotten <em>close</em> to understanding his motivations is the oldest of them,  Amos,  and considering Amos has gotten to the point where he feels the gods need to fuck off and let the mortals solve their own problems,  he's not really talking about it.
<p></p>Basically,  the core reason behind his motivation is to keep his 'soul' running. When a mortal ascends they attach their soul to an object or concept to gain more power. Ponies can only affect the flow when it passes through them,  pulling on it in ways that cause a domino effect in order for what they want to happen,  to happen. The larger their 'soul',  the more room they have to pull. So when they bond to something very large,  they gain a lot of magic potential. Umbrella's soul is attached to the concept of <em>things happening</em>,  so the more things that happen,  the more powerful he is. He goes out of his way to arrange events in such a way that it'll cause a cascade into something. Like,  arranging for a delivery to a bakery,  then buying the last muffin in the bakery so a mare who normally passes by for breakfast gets caught up <em>just</em> long enough for her to meet the deliverystallion. He requires things to happen in such a way that they will cause more things to happen. Stories that beget stories,  even if they're very small stories. So in that sense he would never want to interfere,  because then the story would end.
<p></p>Arguably the most concerning aspect is that nopony knows exactly <em>why</em> he wants as much power as he can get,  because most of his interference is apparently mundane...

<p></p>That's very interesting.
<p></p>I'm interested in seeing where that goes.
<p></p>As for Ajimu,  I was calling her restrained compared to <em>Discord</em>. That isn't a high bar. She still shows off sometimes (which is always hilliarious as she tends to use a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfText" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfText">Wall of Text</a> of her powers,  when really,  she could get away with barely any. <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SOme" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SOme">S Ome</a> of them are <em>horribly</em> broken,  after all.) But her motivation is ... complicated. She believes that she's a badly written <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillianSue" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillianSue">Villian Sue</a> in a manga and she wants to prove herself wrong by either finding a task so difficult she can't do it no matter how hard she tries (ignoring her weaknesses) or making everyone in the Universe equally powerful.

            So I finally got the Applejack Micro.  I actually really enjoyed it. The plot isn't breaking new ground at all,  like we said before,  but even though it's a fairly standard plot it was executed <em>really</em> well.  The character voices were spot on and the art in this issue is probably the best aside from the Rarity Micro.  It doesn't exactly have a ton of depth,  but I really enjoyed reading it.  AJ's Sass Squash impression made me LOL.

            Ah,  I see. Sounds kind of neat.
<p></p>And yeah... the trouble with The Stallion With The Small Umbrella is,  he's <em>incredibly</em> difficult to actually utilize in any way unless direct attention is called to him,  and the point of him is kind of that he doesn't draw attention to himself. Since his presence in a story makes it seem <em>like</em> <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">Contrived Coincidence</a> is going on. It's possible to have a small mention of him at one point,  and then have him appear very subtly later. The only idea I have at this point is The Cosmic Council discussing what to do about a genocidal lunaticm and someone suggests calling him,  at which point three gods who are famous for <em>never</em> agreeing on anything instantly agreeing that they want nothing to do with him.
