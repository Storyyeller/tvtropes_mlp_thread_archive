            The Derpy scene just sort of blindsided me. It was also weird that she has the exact same voice as Rainbow Dash. It just seemed like very needless fanservice.
<p></p>Also I think I saw who will become Dinky's father.

            A few slightly amusing gags,  but as usual,  the situation was handled fairly poorly on all sides,  AJ with her wounded pride and the rest of the girls with their inability to let sleeping dogs lie.  Ms. Jubilee was pretty nice,  I think it was only me but the design reminded me a bit of Miss Kitty from Gunsmoke and half expected a little nod to Marshall Dillon.  The assembly line gag is still pretty fun,  too.

            So you didn't like one episode,  and because other people did,  you're not ever going to watch the show again,  AJ? I didn't like the episode either,  but that doesn't mean that the next one might not be the best episode ever. At least give it a few more chances to see what's going on.
<p></p>But if you still want to leave,  then fine. So long,  AJ.

            <div class="quoteblock">Moe,  what's so turning point about this episode? </div>
<p></p>1.  Canonizing Derpy.  Its interesting to wonder how much this would've affected me if I weren't into the fandom and knew the full history,  but as it is... its a lot like seeing an OC from someone's fanfic actually appear as a named character in the show.  I just don't know how to feel about that,  outside of a general "Oh my god,  they did it" feeling.
<p></p>2.  Actually being consistent about the Friendship Express leading to Canterlot.  In general,  it feels like the Pony world is starting to "solidify" somewhat,  and lose kind of the "anything goes" nature it always seemed to.
<p></p>3.  Actually using Pinkie Pie as a weapon,  and therefore acknowledging she's actually kind of weird (rather than just "she's there") just... it kinda blew my mind.
<p></p>4.  The episode itself honestly dealt with something kind of hard-hitting that threatened to seriously turn friends against friends,  and not in the stupid way Discord did.  In that sense,  its actually kind of the darkest episode of the season (even though I,  like Kegisak,  kinda guessed what was going on,  the way the girls handled it... tugged at me).
<p></p>5.  Finalizing the fact that ponies use outhouses.  I just honestly never expected them to canonize that kind of detail (I know technically this started in the last episode but still).
<p></p>I know,  it may sound like I'm... confused over nothing,  but that's only because its hard to put into words all the little niggling things my subconscious mind noticed as I was watching this episode.  It just... felt different,  overall.  Not necessarily <em>bad</em>,  but something that just said "this is not normal."  And I'll need time to decide if I liked it or not.

<p></p>This is it. When they don't handle the situations properly,  THAT'S what makes a less-than-stellar episode. When they get each other angry and stuff.

            I will say that as annoying as Pinkie was,  I'm glad that they at least acknowledged it in the show rather than just treating her normally.

Like the fact that she didn't <em>win</em> didn't bug her as much as the fact that she didn't get any money to bring back to the town.

<p></p>To be honest,  I would have preferred it if the rodeo had taken place in another city,  not Canterlot. Not only does that kind of event seem a little inappropriate for the kind of place we've seen Canterlot to be,  they also established that mountain to be right next to the desert. But whatever,  hardly a big deal.

            Well,  I for one loved the episode,  really my only big complaint is with Derpy's voice,  but that's mostly because I'm so used to Peirce Smolder's Ditzy voice from her vids. Yeah it had a lot more one off,  not really related to the plot gags and shout-outs,  but they were all funny.

            @Moe: Honestly,  with the exception of Derpy I don't see how this changes anything. Just because one writer(Amy Keating Rogers in this case) wanted some consistent to how things were portrayed,  doesn't mean that another writer won't come along and completely ignore them.

            Well,  she was afraid she'd disappointed them. It was less her own pride than <em>their</em> pride in her. Plus the money issue. I can forgive AJ in this episode,  honestly,  considering I might not have been too far off from doing the same thing.
