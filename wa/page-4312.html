            I don't know,  gauging from Mage's personality I'd assume he'd go for Mac. Which means he'll need to get in line,  thank you.
<p></p>Unless there's some way for me to get at <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MattGoddamnHillYouGuys" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MattGoddamnHillYouGuys">Soarin</a>. Then you can have him.
<p></p>Ahem. More to the point,  I think it would be nice if they did do something about it,  but I think whoever mentioned it is right in that the easiest way to do it is to not draw attention to it. That's why I really wanted to see a background colt/colt couple in Hearts and Hooves. There was <em>one</em>,  but it was soooooooo small you couldn't even get a good look at who it was. &lt;:[

            Nope. Actually,  now that I think about it,  I'm not completely sure how we wound up on this topic... Anyway. Being a kid's show (unless it gets a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrittyReboot" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrittyReboot">Gritty Reboot</a>) the show will treat the topic of sex/affection/love within the realms of nuzzling noses or (possibly) kissing,  like in Hearts and Hooves day.
<p></p>Also,  isn't the music amazing?! I've had Winter Wrap Up stuck in my head for like a half hour now! :D

            Well,  there is this: The general term for lover in Equestria is 'special somepony'. Note that in either case,  this does not imply a gender. Worth noting,  as far as that goes.
<p></p>Now,  when the show gets a spinoff for teens as the audience grows up,  then maybe we'll get a gay character/episode. But for now,  for a kids show? Yeah,  not happening in focus at least.

<p></p>Ilse,  are you LGBT or an ally?  We seem to have a higher-than-average population of bi folks here,  let alone LGBT folks in general. =D
<p></p>@Keg: Yeah,  but it's also 'special someone' here,  and we're very much still a heteronormative society.

            See,  I don't think there'll ever be a gritty reboot of ponies. What I do think is... what's the best comparison here? Okay,  you know how warner studios made <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animaniacs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a>,  then <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Freakazoid" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Freakazoid">Freakazoid!</a>,  then <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkieAndTheBrain" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkieAndTheBrain">Pinkie And The Brain</a>? And the shows sort of had this 'for kids, ',  'for middleschool' 'for teens' feel,  respectively,  just in time for the audience of the original to be that age? I think it'll be like that. The next my little pony will be aimed more towards teens,  about he time the audience hits that age. Hopefully with the same team.
<p></p>This show,  for all it has,  deals with issues that will hit young kids. An older series could deal with more complex issues like,  yes,  sexuality.
<p></p>Also,  Mage: Grr... hording all the stallion love for yourself... &lt;shakes fist&gt;. (Bi probably 2 or 3 here. Maybe even 4,  lately.)

            Hmmm... I think that if good writers come on board,  MLP can become,  just like you said,  like Pinky and the Brain. Also,  as people become more open-minded about sexuality,  I suspect more and more LGBT topics handled respectfully (I hate when characters are defined by <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a>,  although that's a rant for another day and another thread) will start entering TV soon! :D
<p></p>Anyway,  about Iron Will.. do you guys suspect the character will be male or female? When I first read the synopsis,  I thought it was female,  but it seems a lot of people think it should be male. Thoughts?
