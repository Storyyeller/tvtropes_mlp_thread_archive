            My dreams are too fucking random and also extremely depressing,  though they all share a common theme: me being abused. And not even by the person who actually did abuse me. My abuser died 7 years ago and the abuse ended 10 years ago. WTF.
<p></p>And it was just physical abuse,  and not even the worst kind. So why the fuck do I have dreams of being emotionally abused?

            @Storyyeller I've just started the game,  Story. So far my first impressions on it so far it's looking good and I'm gonna enjoy it for sure. One character I don't like so far is probably Wellington,  he's very snooty and REALLY likes to rub it in everyone's faces that he's better than them. And how the hell do you get a PHD in Drifting anyway?

<p></p>Dreams are actually easier to remember when you're keeping a dream journal.
<p></p>Still no pony dreams,  though. :/

<p></p>That's because you forget them soon after waking up. You can only remember it if you specifically make an effort to remember it right after waking up.

            Back when I used to frequent Newgrounds,  I used to notice that Rina-chan's name in every second or third voiced animation. Then I kind of stopped going there after Youtube really started gaining momentum. It was a real blast from the past to see her name pop up in pony works.

Sometimes,  not even then. You don't know how many times I've logged "forgotten" in my dream journal. (Which is shorthand for "I'm pretty sure I had a dream,  but for the life of me,  I can't remember what it was now".)

            (Sighs) ............ Ya know,  I really need to shut my mouth when it comes to Merriwether Williams. Cuz let me tell ya,  the last couple of minutes for me watching this episode is like being shot at while trying to avoid spiked walls while riding on a fucking barrel....that's what this episode felt like to me....if Read and Weep is my favourite episode then Putting your Hoof Down is the worst episode I've seen throughout this show and oddly enough both my best and worst episodes happen to be in the same season. Really does speak volumes when ya think about it.
<p></p>I'm literally speechless with how bad this episode is and the questions that are floating around in my head are: "Why was this episode green lit? Why was it even considered for airing? Where the fuck did they go from making Fluttershy all sweet and innocent to making her into a fucking bitch?!" The episode makes almost virtually EVERYONE in Ponyville into a fucking asshole when in the last episode they were all happy and cheery and singing along with Pinkie Pie! Not to be outdid with the fact that this WHOLE PLOT WAS CAUSED BY ANGEL! Seriously Angel can go to hell because he's the sole reason why I hate this episode so much was all because he was responsible for this plot line even existing in the first place!
<p></p>And because Fluttershy never punishes him for what he did in this episode it just makes me even more infuriated with him! Oh and Fluttershy doesn't go off scotch free however because I was shocked and appalled at her actions throughout this entire episode. Why? BECAUSE SHE ACTS LIKE A FUCKING BITCH TOWARDS EVERYONE! She has the NERVE to go out of her way just go and insult Rarity and Pinkie Pie,  her two best friends when all they were doing was trying to help her out! Christ she's even worse than Peter Griffin in this episode!
<p></p>So far,  this is the only episode so far that has made me cringe,  no seriously this is the only episode that has ever made me cringe in this season,  in this entire show. Let that sink in for a minute there cuz I'm not repeating this twice. To put it simple,  I. Hate. Every.Single. Moment. Of. This. Episode in general and it's even worse than either The Cutie Pox or The Mysterious Mare Do Well put together.
<p></p>And for my sake,  I hope to god that Fluttershy redeems herself later on in this show because it's gonna take a whole lot for me to forgive Fluttershy for what she's done in this episode.Because along with Angel I have now considered Fluttershy to be the worst character of this show because of all the horrible heinous acts she pulled here,  which really saddens me cuz she was a character who I particularly liked. The only saving grace about this episode was Iron Will. Out of all the things Fluttershy's been put through and despite him being the one to assert her,  Iron Will is by far the only intelligent character in this entire episode and is at least reasonable when Fluttershy backs out completely which I have to commend Iron Will for doing which I think this is how the episode should've been handled at least.
<p></p>Other that the episode sucks,  I don't recommend to this anyone,  don't watch this episode,  I hate it,  end of story.
Now if you excuse me,  I'm gonna play some Ace Attorney Justice for All and forget this episode ever happened.
