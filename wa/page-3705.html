            INCOMING WALL OF TEXT. STEER CLEAR. <br>I have to stop writing so much while I watch. <br> <br>I’m glad I resisted watching early. While it wasn’t the best episode,  it was pretty great. Not sure what I was expecting,  and it didn’t quite live up to the hype the people who watched early said,  but still. Not particularly a fan of the song though. It was nice because Sweetie Belle was singing,  but other than that…meh.  Sweetie Belle needs to sing more,  anyway. <br><br><br> <br>That card is too big. Way way way too big. Did they mention how long it took them to make it? It must’ve taken all day. They really thought that picnic through,  too. Just how long were they thinking about this? <br> <br>I’m really liking Cheerilee in this episode,  she’s continuing to go up my favorites list. And with “That’s an Apple Tree” she proves she is an expert at knowing what trees are in apple orchards. How exactly would Big Mac use the hammer? I’m sort of imagining him twisting his neck and holding the nail with both of his front hooves. That first Cheerilee-Big Mac conversation is great and awkward at the same time. <br> <br>…Twilight,  why would you mention that potion to them? I’m kind of interested in the other book she had. What kind of book would it be if she thought it would interest the CMC? …A tuft of cloud? A Rainbow’s Glow? How would you even grab those? I just…don’t…what. <br> <br>In the second picnic,  the CMC had the best smug faces. I don’t think any other faces can top those. Sweetie Belle continues to prove herself as the best CMC.  I don’t see what’s so bad about the love potion honestly,  how else would they have gotten the two together so fast and easy for the span of the episode. <br> <br>These Cheerilee and Big Mac lines,  they’re so ridiculous. Oh god. The CMC have the BEST reaction to that. Seriously. If even Mrs. Cake is weirded out by this,  you know something went wrong. <br> <br>“I’m runnin’ out of ways to make diamonds sound bad!” Apple Bloom proves she isn’t the best at vocabulary. How did Big Mac buy the gem and leave without Scootaloo or Apple Bloom noticing? Big Mac’s strength is just getting a little absurd now. I kind of hope they turn it down a bit. I mean,  it makes him more interesting,  but seriously? Pulling a house? <br> <br>In all the later scenes,  was William Anderson told to just write the sappiest background music possible? The CMC must really like Cheerilee if they’re completely honest with her like that. Normally,  they ignore their troubles and just lie.<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> Big Mac and Cheerilee enjoy the prankster’s gambit on this exchange.</div></span> <br> <br><div class="quoteblock"> EVERYPONY FLAIL</div>
I was going to talk about how hilarious this was,  but it’s already been gif’d and shared. Ha. <br> <br>Also,  the potential time travel/time message episode. I approve. Can't wait to see how that works out.

            @ Kyler: Considering the other things that had to be changed as well to make the Poison work properly,  it would have to eliminate the need to sleep or otherwise the Poison would wear off after one day. And Big Mac's strength was ridiculously high,  he was pulling a house. Cheerilee's strength was huge as well considering she's just a teacher.

            Well,  looks like this episode did a lot less ship sinking than it had the potential to. I wonder if people are still complaining anyway.
<p></p>Really liked the episode. Cute,  very funny,  and it had a nice song.

            Presumably the Love Poison just weakens their inhibitions that prevent them from using their raw brute strength. Big Mac is really that strong,  only he normally actually has something we call self-control because otherwise he'd break stuff too easily.
<p></p>My own personal fanon is that Alicorns happen when a pony has access to all three types of innate Pony magic. More powerful alicorns have more raw power,  so there are rare cases of nerfed alicorns with power equal to 1/3 each of Earth Pony,  Pegasus,  and Unicorn.

...wha? Apples and bits are one thing,  but seriously? There's a slight difference between lifting a bunch of tiny things and pulling a house. I never said him being strong was bad or that Big Mac WASN'T incredibly strong or anything like that. With how many <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs">E Ps</a> there are,  it would be slightly ridiculous that they were all super strong. I just think it's a little ridiculous that a single pony could pull an average house so easily. Although it was probably either the potion or overplaying his strength for comedy. Same with Cheerilee. Also,  <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs">E Ps</a> are number two on my list. I want them to be better,  but I just didn't enjoy this particular example.
