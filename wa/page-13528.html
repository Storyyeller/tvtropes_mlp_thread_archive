            <div class="quoteblock">Hey,  Blissey,  I'm brainstorming for a time travel fanfic right now,  and I'm wondering what's the state of the art for pony stories on that topic. </div>
<p></p>time travel mechanics,  eh? well,  the vast majority of any stories involving time travel fall under Dr. Whooves,  and out of the number of such fics I've read,  I'm afraid you're quite right,  most of them do treat time travel as an enabling plot device rather than the focus of the story.
<p></p>hmm...there is one story that had something sorta kinda related that may help if you just want some ideas on time travel. it was as human in post extinction event canterlot who,  whenever he went to sleep,  body swapped with a pony in pre extinction event canterlot. That's sort of like time travel,  but again,  not too much explanation was given to it.
<p></p>I dunno if that helps at all,  but I guess it's something.

            Rarity has gotten rave reviews from one of Equestria's biggest fashion critics,  and designed outfits for the royal wedding and for one of Equestria's biggest pop stars. There is every indication that Fancy Pants,  one of Canterlot's biggest taste makers,  considers her a friend. Rarity hasn't quite reached her goal,  but she's made definite progress on that front.

            Yeah,  class isn't genetic and it's coler that Rarity dragged hersef up.
<p></p>And yeah,  that accent is fake in real life. As in,  it's not one that people grow up speaking. That said,  being around people who talk like that can cause you to switch to that accent without any effort on your part. So it doesn't necessarily imply intentional deceit.
<p></p>I know how easy it is for accents to shift. My sster and I absorbed some of our cousins' American accent and I litterally <em>felt</em> my accent shift when I started university. I've spent a month in New Zealand as well,  so I proably absorbed some of their accent as well.

            It's not so much that I want class to be genetic as I'd like Rarity to be able to have a father and mother (or father surrogate and mother surrogate) that truly appreciate fashion,  who can understand the art.
<p></p>Also,  I dislike the idea that Rarity's father is actually an earth pony,  because it ruins the symmetry of having two unicorns,  two earth ponies,  and two pegasi.  Having Rarity be half-unicorn half-pegasi makes it 1.5 unicorns,  2.5 earth ponies,  and two pegasi.  I know that that has absolutely nothing to do with personality or anything,  but I have numerical compulsions and a desire for symmetry that wants indulgence,  darnit.

Yeah,  there's that. <em>The Best Night Ever</em> is just a great story,  and <em>Hard Reset</em> had an interesting mix of action,  humor,  and examination of the psychological fallout of getting stuck in (and subsequently escaping) a time loop.

            Keep in mind that Rarity was responsible for designing the outfits for her class play back when she was still pretty young.  The fact that her parents let her take on a responsibility like that indicates they had at least some faith in her abilities.

<p></p>Well I know the German G3 dub translated the names. Pinkie Pie became Rosarot for instance. I don't know about the G4 dub though.

            Rosarot is a beautiful name.
<p></p>It would be a good name for a daughter of Pinkie Pie.
<p></p>Also,  oh,  I guess Rarity's parents really did have faith in her abilities,  even from a young age.  Even if they aren't really into fashion; I can't deny that they allowed her to pursue her dream to its fullest extent.  They also must have been pretty accepting of her attempting to be high class,  with all its affectations and such; even though it's a far cry from their lifestyle.  Now that I think about it,  that's some pretty darn good parenting.

            Alright,  home from the weekend and watching the new episode.
<p></p>Well,  this intro looks familiar.
<p></p>Dash's despondent scream of despondency is almost as cute as her desperate attempts to be standoffish with Tank.  Since when was she so adorable? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>The Crystal Empire seems to be having an infestation of excessive bloom,  and their local Crystal Sunglasses business didn't last long on account of "OH GOD IT'S MAKING IT WORSE".
<p></p>...I think Cadence got ripped off with the mud baths.  That stuff looks like sneeze.  I'm thinking Diamond Dog scam.
