            @Story: I'll admit,  OOC stuff is basically my #1 pet peeve when it comes to fanfic.  Basically,  at this point the issue I'm seeing is that I'm being presented with a situation in which a canon character is doing something that appears OOC.  Yes,  there might be an explanation in the story,  but <em>I do not have that explanation at this point.</em>  And aside from you guys telling me,  I don't have any reason to believe that an explanation is forthcoming.

            @Story The problem I have with that is that I have a hard time seeing how they could have thought that those were good ideas at the time. Of course,  I'm sure I'll get the answers to that later,  but it seems to me like things went <em>way</em> too far,  and that Luna or Twilight or <em>somepony</em> with common sense should have stepped in before things got to that point. Again,  still not enough information,  but that's the issue.

            Speaking of which,  I wonder what the best way to make something that will be debated in this thread is. I think the most important step is to get Ginger to rage at it. Then everyone else who's read it will argue with him and the other people in the thread will start reading it so they can keep up with the discussion.

<p></p>As for the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCness" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCness">OO Cness</a>,  imagine a fic that was a detective story. You keep seeing more and more evidence through the fic that a member of the mane 6 comited the murder even though it would naturally be massively OOC for them to have done so. Only at the end is the truth revealed. FOE is a lot like that and it works.

            Neither is she a hyper-competent partygoer.
<p></p>If this IS FOE you're talking about,  <em>nothing</em> about the fic matches up with any canon,  so you can't really take canon behaviours into account. It's like if I introduced a childhood trauma of AJ's in a fic and it causes her to shut down. you can say 'AJ isn't a coward in canon',  but that doesn't apply here because I've introduced something that's never applied to canon. I'm showing an aspect of her character thus far unseen,  that doesn't make it any less valid.
<p></p>I honestly don't have any particular thoughts for season 3. I'm happy to see what they give us.
<p></p>Though I'd like some more duo episodes. Too many solo episodes in this season.

            @Sereg: It would help a lot more if the story was actually formatted like a detective story.  And even in a detective story you have to be careful <em>which</em> bits of information you hide from the reader so it doesn't seem like it comes out of nowhere when you finally learn it.  But I'll wait until I get further before I complain too much.  I really am enjoying the story so far,  at least the bits that are taking place in the present.
