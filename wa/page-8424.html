            Bending is obviously vital for industry,  so that may put a wrench in things. And some of his later tactics are less supportable,  but we'll see.

            I'm going to regret asking this,  but I have to know:
<p></p>What makes this show so popular outside it's demographic?
<p></p>I watched about half the first season with my youngest when he was home sick,  and I saw absolutely nothing special in it.  It was more tolerable than some other animated shows he likes,  but it's not something I'd ever watch voluntarily on my own.  The plots are a pretty standard aesop-of-the-week format,  I've seen all the (static) characters before,  and the humor is nothing special.
<p></p>Am I missing something,  or is this some weird internet meme?

            @ccoa: Mostly it's popular because of a combination of factors. It begins with a bunch of article writers bashing Lauren for "selling out" and making the show for Hasbro,  luring some Anons from /co/ to watch and see what the fuss is all about. They loved it,  drew in more anons,  got the attention of the Internet in general,  and within a few months,  bronies had practically become an Internet Demographic (and one a lot more tolerable than the rabid fandumbs seen elsewhere!) and ponies re-entered the mainstream. Between the refreshingly three-dimensional Mane Six and the astonishingly consistent world,  the excellent dialogue and entertaining humor,  the show also has a bunch of seriously better-than-so-called-kid's-shows plot points and jokes and plenty of life lessons that adults could do well to learn or re-learn.
<p></p>Well,  at least like their distant relatives the Transformers,  ponies are also originally merch-driven,  only now Lauren has made the show <em>good</em> on a level that rivals <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastWars" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformersAnimated" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a>.

            @ccoa: Also,  there are many interest groups drawn into the series by proxy. /tg/ styled guys love the fantasy aspect of the world of Equestria,  with the dangerous wildlife taken straight out of Gygax's Monster Manuals and authentic mythological foes which add a cultural depth (just like ZUN did for <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Touhou" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Touhou">Touhou</a>).
<p></p>The music is excellent and addictive,  thanks to master bard Daniel Ingram (ZUN also does a mean FM Synth chiptune that results in the oldest and deepest Crowning Music subsection that was for a while the most popular pages of Crowning Music and still are regularly expanded with even more entries,  mushrooming so much they page actually got split into several sections! Now does that no sound familiar? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">) Between the Deceptive cadence (Hahaha,  Daniel you card) and the pseudo-Metal vibes in This Day Aria,  Daniel wields his composer's stylus well.

            @ccoa: I would say it either clicks with you or it doesn't. I like the animation,  I like the writing,  and I like the willingness of the show makers not to resort to (or at least subvert) 'girl show' tropes and respect the intended audience. The morals aren't 100% straightforward,  there is continuity,  and character development tends to accumulate over a period of time and gets referenced in subtle ways.
<p></p>And there's just enough adult humor to keep it fresh. Oh,  and good music,  can't forget that.
<p></p>But,  yeah,  not everyone will love it,  and I don't want to overrate it. It's just fun for me,  is all.
