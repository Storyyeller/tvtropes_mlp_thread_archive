            The problem was never Twilight trying to disprove PS,  it was that she condemed it as impossible from the begining and became obsessed with proving herself right no matter the cost,  and with making others accept her point of view. The idea that PP was right never entered into her mind.

            Especially when her reason for giving in made
<p></p>NO!!
<p></p>FUCKING!!!
<p></p>SENSE!!!!
<p></p>She says "Pinkie's Pinkie Sense... makes sense" She says this after a giant Hydra turns out to <strong>NOT</strong> be the "biggie" that Pinkie "predicted". If ANYTHING this should've acted as proof that the Pinkie Sense WASN'T real,  not proof that it WAS real.
<p></p>That,  combined with the fact that her giving in WAS the "biggie" just left me with a real bad taste in my mouth. A taste called <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a>. Twilight was doomed to give in in the end,  whether it made any logical sense for her to or not.

            @Arha: Yeah,  that's part of why this episode is so controversial.  I think that just proves that Twilight had the wrong approach; she didn't really care about how it worked,  she just cared about proving herself right,  and when she realized that she couldn't prove that she was right,  she stopped caring about it.

            I really don't understand why people make a big deal out of the morals.  The morals are put in the show for little kids who don't have a very solid understanding of the way the world works and are still figuring out morality.  We're adults.  The morals aren't there for us at all.  I just watch the show for the comedy,  great characters,  and cuteness.

            I think that...in the end Twilight just snapped what she may have said was PS makes sense,  but what she she meant was "I give up! You win!"
<p></p>As to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a>,  I am so used to time loops,  pyschic powers,  and the what not that I can't bring myself to care about it. That having been said,  it was meant to be ironic,  not to demonstrate a lack of free will on Twilights part,  if she had been truly stuborn then PP would never have gotten her PS about it and persumably it would have ended her friendship with PP. That she got it meant that Twilight was a good person meant to ultamietly do the right thing and accept her friend's point of view without question rather then tearing it apart because it dosen't fit her world view.

            @Blue Why did Twilight give in? The Hydra not being the Biggie should've acted as PROOF that the Pinkie sense wasn't real. (the proof she'd been searching for all episode)
<p></p>I can't think of a reason beyond. "it was necessary to fulfill Pinkie's prediction"

            <div class="quoteblock">I really don't understand why people make a big deal out of the morals. The morals are put in the show for little kids who don't have a very solid understanding of the way the world works and are still figuring out morality. We're adults. The morals aren't there for us at all. I just watch the show for the comedy,  great characters,  and cuteness. </div>
<p></p>The morals are the thing I feel to be the most important thing to criticize in a children's show. When an adult reads a story and discovers the moral,  they shrug it off. Children are not exactly innocent angels or anything,  but they're not that set in their thinking yet,  so their thinking is much more likely to be shaped at this stage.

<p></p>Because....the hydra not being "The Biggie" proved that their was no way PP was faking (the only possible explenation for PS). Anyone who <em>was</em> faking would have lept on it immeditly as "The Biggie" but since PP didn't it had to mean her PS was genuien,  not false.
