<p></p>I got the impression that she actually did intend for Twi to do it all by herself,  and only decided after the fact that Twi's actions constituted a passing performance.

<p></p>also yes do a live watch

            I find it rather weird that Discord,  the force of nature,  was the more in your face personal villain,  while Sombra the Dark Lord type villain was more of the looming threat. Perhaps it would have been best if it was the other way around? Then again people like Discord as the Evil God Imp so probably not.
<p></p>I kind of wish that these openings would stop treating these characters like this is the first time we have meet'em. I know,  gotta be watchable in any order. But,  still.

            Well,  seeing as how almost ALL of Celestia's test have been Tricksy so far,  I'd say Celestia planned that from the start. And quite the lesson too,  teaching Twilight to trust her heart rather then to blindly follow instructions,  even if it was from her own Sovereign Princess.
<p></p>Makes you wonder if she's planning something...

            There was a LOT of focus given to Sombra's horn. We saw it capable of apparently working independently,  corrupting the landscape on it's own,  and it regenerated on it's own. Not sure how common that is. We also saw a pretty clear shot of it being blown away. I can't really help but imagine that the Horn of Sombra,  at least,  will be of importance.

            Anyone find it kind of funny that even the red dragon from the ep "Dragonshy" got more fleshed out as a character than Sombra?

            That whole "you must do it yourself" thing always seemed a little hinky given how important friendship and working together has been in the show,  so I prefer to think that it was just part of the test.
<p></p>Why Celestia is using the fate of an entire kingdom as a test I don't know.  Hey Celly,  Luna wants to go along.  Maybe you should let her.

            @Crow: Probably due to the fact that 1. The empire needed to be saved. 2. Twilight has saved Equestria multiple times by this point 3. Twilight has reason to care,  since her Brother and his wife are in charge of the place 4. Celestia isn't going to let a teaching opportunity go to waste.
<p></p>Also,  there are now going to be like a zillion fanfics about what various characters see when they look into that door.
