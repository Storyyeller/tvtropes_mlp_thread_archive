            Basically,  the issues with the console are massive invasion of privacy (Kinect 2.0 ALWAYS ON),  mandatory internet connection,  forfeiting ownership of games entirely (no borrowing games - you can only buy them new,  buy them used for a fee that makes them cost as much as new,  or simply get the game from a friend who's been your Xbox friend for over 30 days (s/he loses access to said game when that happens)),  and overall shitty focus on everything that is NOT games (XBOX TV,  XBOX SPORTS,  XBOX MOVIE,  XBOX INTERNET EXPLORER,  XBOX XBOX XBOX FUCKING SMARTGLASS).
<p></p>Also shitty pricetag ($500 in US,  approx. $666 US when buying outside of US).
<p></p>But that's enough of that.

            @CDRW: I'm really not interested in the XBOX at all,  but from what I heard the main issue was that most of the "features" of the XBOX one made it seem like it was trying too hard to be a PC; stuff like social media,  streaming features,  being able to talk to other people,  etc. and not enough on the GAMING aspects. And even that was frought with the announcement that the console basically requires an online connection to play anything and that you can't play borrowed or rented games on it; it won't let you play a disc unless you've payed for the game.
<p></p>The only next-gen console I'm probably going to buy is maybe the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiiU" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiiU">Wii U</a> and even then I'm waiting for a while. I only got my <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS3" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS3">PS3</a> about a year ago,  so I have a decent backlog to work through before I need a new console. Not to mention the PSN has a bunch of Playstation and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS2" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS2">PS2</a> games to work through.
<p></p>Also,  congrats on the job. Hope you get it.

            Yeah,  for the most part it's there for first looks,  so it's not liek they're ever gonna do anythign that huge. Nobody wants to risk their focus trailers getting overshadowed by something else at a huge event like that,  I think.
<p></p>As for the console issues... Well,  probably the big one is a sort of perceived loss of freedom with your games - the system has really specific DRM,  so a game can only be 'loaned' to one person,  and it won't work for anyone else,  then. There's been some question about whether or not used games will be viable,  though I think the conclusion they've now come to is that there'll be a fee for used,  or something.
<p></p>Games have to be loaded onto Xbox live last time I heard,  and can only be played from there,  but Gold still requires a fee - though there'll still be the free accounts I don't doubt. Still,  for many it's cause for concern because it basically means all your games are still in Microsoft's hands.
<p></p>And then there's the camera and the connectivity... Xbox needs to check in at least once a day,  meaning that you need to have at least a relatively stable internet connection,  or you'll be unable to play - literally,  the Xbox will refuse to play if you can't check in. While the console is on,  the Kinect Camera,  which comes bundled,  is always on,  and it must be connected for the Xbox to work. It can be 'paused',  whatever that means,  but not turned off without turning off the system.
<p></p>In the initial press release it also looked like they were basically ignoring the game aspect of it in general,  in favour of showing off how it could control your TV,  or Skype and the like. On the whole I don't think it'll wind up being THAT convenient,  but the system still concerns me based on the precedent it sets,  because if it succeeds(Which is kinda unlikely) then Microsoft might feel like pushing further next time.

            I meant that if people are worried Kinect is going to spy on them even when the Xbox is off,  they could simply unplug the console after use. Annoying,  but with the added benefit of getting to buck authority.

            As I just brought a brand new 360 a few months ago,  there's no way I'm considering a One.  And what a confusing name.  Type it into google and the original xbox keeps cropping up.

            Hah.
<p></p>Yeah,  I'm probably gonna avoid the new consoles for at least a year or two. Quite frankly at this point I can do anything that's on an console on my PC,  and it'll look better(And in the case of shooters,  control better). And with the new pricetags,  upgrading your PC every now and then is actually <em>cheaper</em> than a new console.

            The kinect camera issue brings up memories of hearing about experimental technology that uses a microphone to listen in on the conversation in your house and use that to target tv commercials at you. Dunno hardware what it was exactly,  but pointing the Kinect camera at the wall might not be enough if it's anything similar to that.
