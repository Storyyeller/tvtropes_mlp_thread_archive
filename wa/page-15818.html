            Honestly,  it's probably less issues with the keys and more not being able to see when you make typos. I can touch-type pretty well,  but I can also fix any mistakes really easily because I can correct myself as I go.

            It took me a few months to memorize,  but it's  well worth the effort giving me a pretty fast typing speed. The trickiest part is wading through all the text without a mouse,  but I've gotten used to it.

            I didn't really know how to type that well until my junior high had typing classes,  which helped me to become a pretty fast typist.  I don't know that I would want to generally try typing with my eyes closed,  though,  at least if I want to not make too many mistakes.  Or with my glasses off,  which would mean that I would have to get very close to the screen for the letters to not be blurry (I'm pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWithoutThem" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWithoutThem">Blind Without Them</a> not in the literal sense of being truly blind but to the extent that even the big E on the eye chart is blurry to me when taking an eye test).  Like Derpy,  I even had a drifting eye once when I was 10 or 11 but that was able to be corrected surgically.
<p></p>On a different subject that just thought of and found amusing,  I realized that it was fitting of me to pre-order the 2nd favorites collection to come in the mail rather than looking for it in stores (because that can be rather uncertain since the store websites aren't always accurate,  plus I thought that something like that set would get sold out quickly).  This is because it includes Derpy,  whose fanon interpretation is that she's a mailpony (or works at some kind of delivery job) and thus I found it amusingly appropriate to have Derpy coming in the mail.

            By the way,  last night I started wondering about what would happen to a pegasus who couldn't fly if they stayed in Cloudsdale. Presuambly they could still walk around on clouds,  but they might feel like they couldn't fit in. I think Scootaloo is lucky to have ended up in Ponyville instead.

            @storyyeller: In that case,  I would imagine Cloudsdale having transport services for pegasi who are injured or have flying disabilities because otherwise the pegasus in question wouldn't be able to fly from cloud to cloud unless they were close enough together to jump between.  Or maybe pegasi who can't fly can still use their wings or pegasi magic to manipulate clouds so that they could ride on them like humans who can't walk use wheelchairs.
