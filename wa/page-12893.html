            I don't really care for the pegasi have no families idea just because 1. it doesn't seem at all like something the show would do,  and 2. the only reason we don't see Fluttershy or Rainbow Dash's parents is because there's just no reason to involve them in the plot.  There just isn't a big enough sample size to claim that <em>all</em> pegasi are like that when we only have three data points,  all of which make perfect sense without assuming it.
<p></p>As for the lack of a Christmas episode,  I don't really care too much about it.  Another episode that happens to take place during Hearth's Warming Eve would be fine,  but we don't need another episode centered around the holiday.

<p></p>Well,  yeah,  which would be relevant if there were many points where it's actually relevant to bring it up.  It's like claiming that all of my friends are orphans because we don't mention our parents in day-to-day conversation.  It just seems like extrapolating a <em>really</em> major aspect of the setting out of something that could just as easily be a coincidence.
<p></p>It basically boils down to this:  The statement "No pegasi with large roles in the show have been shown with visible parents"
<p></p>The possible explanations for this are either:
<p></p>1. Pegasi don't have a traditional family structure,  despite such a thing not being alluded to anywhere else in the show, 
<p></p>or
<p></p>2. It's just a coincidence,  and the only reason their families haven't appeared is that the plots never required it.
<p></p>Both of the reasons are entirely possible,  but I'm not sure why people are assuming the former when the latter seems <em>far</em> more likely.

<p></p>Technically,  Pound Cake has.
<p></p>Anyway,  I don't think it's relevant,  because ponies never mention their parents anyway. If you took out Sisterhooves Social,  noone would ever guess that Rarity had parents either.

            I don't think Poundcake counts because he wasn't born into a traditional Pegasus family.  His parents are both EP so they wouldn't be raising them in a Pegasus fashion if there is one.

            You know what,  not showing parents is a thing that happens in a variety of series. I think the only reason we're extrapolating from that is that we have a fresh new setting with different rules from our own. If this were <em>My Little Human</em>,  we probably wouldn't be having this discussion.

            We've seen Family for all of the main 6,  whether it be parents or siblings,  save for Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy.
<p></p>We've seen family for 2/3 of the CMC... save for Scootaloo.
<p></p>These are all characters that have been particularly invested in when it comes to storyline.  I find it a bit odd the Pegasi are the ones left out.
<p></p>Were there any Pegasi in the Sisterhoof Social?  I don't remember.
<p></p>Im just rambling here though... its not proof but it does lead to some interesting thoughts on why this is so.  I like making up stuff to entertain myself :P

            @ Turtle: I think of it another way. Scootaloo is the only member of the CMC who's not related to the Mane Six. So her family's the most irrelevant. AJ and Rarity have family from the CMC so it makes sense to show where they are when not with their siblings. Twilight's family have had plots centred around them so they kinda have to be shown. There's been no reason to show Rainbow's or Fluttershy's.

            yeah,  out of the 9 main ponies,  the mane 6 and the CMC,  2/3 have had their parents seen or referenced. And the other 1/3 are all the pegasi.

            They could have been worked into a plot,  I just find it strange that they havent.
<p></p>In fact the latest episode with Scootaloo could have had a brief moment where she said "Let me check with my parents if I can go on this campout"
<p></p>Thats all I need to prove that pegasi arent communally raised :P
<p></p>Fluttershy's parents could have been mentioned in either of her episodes,  even briefly to explain her lack of assertiveness and ability.
<p></p>Rainbow Dash could have said "My parents will be so proud that Im in Wonderbolts flight camp..."
<p></p>The episodes dont need to focus on the parents... just mention them even briefly and I'll change my mind :P

            Scoot's parent,  they're complicated. But Fñuttershy and RD's parents probably stayed up in Cloudsdale,  just like Twi's did at Canterlot.

            I don't really see what those lines would add. Have any of the others ever mentioned that their parents would be proud or they're the reason of something or anything casually?

            No but their parents and or siblings have at least been mentioned or seen.
<p></p>Even in the Cutie Mark Chronicles Im pretty sure all but the Pegasi have parents/family in their stories (Except maybe Rarity? Its been a while)
<p></p>It just seems odd to me.

            Parent discussion,  huh?
<p></p>Well,  with regards to Scoots,  I think that her parents are just so boring that she doesn't bother mentioning them.
<p></p>Rainbow Dash isn't too happy about the Foetal Rainbow Radiation Poisoning her mother inflicted on her.
<p></p>Fluttershy's parents are also just slightly boring.
