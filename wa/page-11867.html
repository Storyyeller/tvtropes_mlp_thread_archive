            The unicorns do however have a slight advantage in that they could <em>hold the entire world ransom</em>.
<p></p>That,  and it seemed like the pegasi were a straight-up military junta.  In all likelihood they could demolish either of the other two rather quickly.

            Eh... The Unicorns can't REALLY do anything because I mean... they need the sun and moon too,  really. The pegasi are the only ones that have some kind of advantage,  being militaristc. But then,  considering they actually <em>believed</em> the Earthies were hiding all the food implies that they believed they <em>could</em> effectively hoard food,  meaning there must be <em>something</em> to them.

Either the other tribes can hold their own in a fight,  or the Pegasi's military prowess is really just greatly exaggerated cultural posturing.
<p></p>Also there is no reason for the Unicorns to keep the sun down since they would just be screwing themselves over as well. As Kegi said.

            Also,  if we're talking military power here,  you have to remember that a unicorn army would be hamstrung by the fact that a <em>very</em> small percentage of unicorns would have magic with combat applications,  and only a portion of them would be soldiers as opposed to scholars or teachers. Pit the average unicorn against the average earth pony,  and I'd put my money on the earth pony every time. An all-unicorn army would be propped up by its combat-talented elite soldiers,  with its normal hoof-soldiers being at a distinct physical disadvantage against either of the other races under normal circumstances. The fact that Pegasi can fly can be countered tactically with terrain and defensible structures that would force them into narrow spaces or on to the ground. Earth Ponies would be by no means helpless.

            Though it doesn't <em>have</em> to be combat magic. Levitation is a basic unicorn skill,  one that can be put into practice by wielding a sword and shield.

            Considering that the baseline for telekinetic strength that we've seen in the show thus far has trouble opening a jar of peanut butter,  I'm not entirely sure that they could effectively wield weapons with the strength to pierce armor or deflect blows. It's kinda hard to tell,  though,  when every main character unicorn's magic is rather powerful. Even Rarity has impressive manipulation and illusion skills. I think the only side characters to ever even cast a non-levitation spell are Trixie,  Snails,  Flim,  and Flam.

            Well,  I figure the average human has trouble opening stuck jars too,  but with conditioning most of us can also develop enough to do something like this.

            I think it would really come down to training.  Given that unicorns are presented as being very highbrow and aristocratic,  I'd think most of them would believe direct combat beneath them. I think the point stands that in most cases,  unicorns would probably be at a relatively even field or possibly disadvantage against <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs">E Ps</a> or Pegasi.  Sure,  specific Twilight level unicorns could certainly whip up uberspells,  but putting the entire weight of the army on them would be like trying to win a war with nothing but tanks.  Yes,  it's dangerous to go up against,  but it's also limited in scope and will usually go down against a more versatile opponent.
<p></p>Pegasi have the most pronounced combat advantage; any enemy without a ranged attack is kinda screwed,  and they have weather control to boot.  Here's how I'd boil down the races combat potential:
<p></p>Unicorns: <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>,  all the way.  They undoubtedly have several very powerful spellcasters who could probably cause enormous amounts of damage,  and are,  on an individual level,  probably the most powerful ponies.  The catch is that 1. Most unicorns aren't that strong,  and telekinesis can only reach a level comparable to physical strength of the other races and 2. chances are that given the society we've been shown,  most of them probably don't have much combat training.  They'd have to rely very heavily on tactics and careful applications of what strong spells they have.
<p></p>Pegasi: <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>.  They'd be best served by keeping their distance and not doing direct combat.  Lots of dropping crap on enemies,  screwing with the weather,  etc.  If they get into hoof-to-hoof combat,  they'd do better than unicorns but not as well as Earth Ponies.  Their weather abilities give them a degree of versatility that the other races lack and overall I think they're probably strongest,  especially given their militaristic culture.
<p></p>Earth Ponies: <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightGlacier" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightGlacier">Might Glacier</a>. Pretty much they have to turtle,  but they're very good at it.  Chances are they have much more food and resources than the other races,  and I'm guessing that due to the physicality they'd do well in direct combat.  The lack of ranged attacks is a problem,  hence why their strategy would have to consist of attrition; hoard food and try to outlast the other groups.

            Proceeding in <em>Fallout Equestria</em> chapter 25,  we've met Red Eye,  and... Littlepip actually does something pretty admirable when she saves the lives of two folks that she hates and fantasized about murdering horribly earlier... I'm kinda confused.

            I'm aware,  given I've read the spoiler there.
<p></p>But seriously,  on the "Ways to make Littlepip less of a twat" checklist I came up with,  I had "Have someone she really hates and that really deserves to die at her mercy,  and then,  to show that she isn't a sociopath that happens to be aimed in a convenient direction,  <em>not</em> murder them." I didn't expect to ever check that off.
<p></p>As for them dying pointlessly,  well,  ain't that another one of my problems. I find myself thinking of <em>The Walking Dead</em> which,  while it does have <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a> in full effect,  none of the deaths so far have felt as pointlessly mean-spirited as some of the stuff in this story...

            @Pannic Ah,  I thought that was in the next chapter. I'm terrible at remembering those things.

            Sorry,  my wording was terrible - the "I'm aware" refers to the bit about the magic mirror. I kinda stopped halfway through the chapter as it pretty much admitted "Yeah,  Littlepip is never getting any better." Though this bit actually has her being genuinely heroic rather than having the heroism being incidental to the parade of violence.

<p></p>Actually,  this episode strangely has Diamond Tiara both at her kindest <em>and</em> her most evil. It does a <em>ton</em> for her character.
