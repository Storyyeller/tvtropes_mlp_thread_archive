            There might have been a little bit during the reveal scene,  but I think it was within acceptable bounds.  I agree that excessive smugness is one of the most annoying personality traits ever,  but I just got the sense during that scene that she was just proud of herself for solving the mystery,  and as long as she isn't rubbing it in everyone's faces it isn't really a flaw.
<p></p>Also I forgot this,  but I love the way she starts puffing away on the bubble pipe as soon as she gets it.

            I thought it was a nice touch that she wiped the pipe off first. If she hadn't I'd have called severe shipping,  but it's a nice little detail of animation.

            About Big Macintosh and the cake,  I was thinking that perhaps the reason carrying the cake was harder may have been because he was carrying it and supporting its weight and also trying to keep it balanced at the same time.  Whereas with the house he was dragging it,  not picking it up,  and he was also using a rope for leverage.  I'm also fairly sure he was holding the cake up longer than he was dragging Berry Punch's house.

            My biggest complaint with the episode was that it puts forth the completly false notion that Watson was thick. Guy was a doctor for crying out loud and certainly of above average intellegence. That and they imply Holmes wore that silly looking hat.

<p></p>Oh,  you mean for ponies.
<p></p>I liked the episode overall,  find it interesting that people are now saying that the Griffons' native tongue is Fancy,  though that could be interesting if it got carried over to our <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaringDo" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaringDo">Daring Do</a> section...
<p></p>Anyway,  I did enjoy the dream sequences,  but I was bothered that Pinkie always said that the cake was <em>sliced</em> in the dream sequences even after Twilight pointed out that the cake had been <em>eaten.</em>

            Twilight wearing that bowler hat was just adorable.  The thing suited her.  Twilight is a pony who can get away with wearing hats even in our time.
<p></p>It's kind of sad that hats are out.  Now the only legit accessory us guys get are ties.

            You know,  Big Mac struggling with that cake made me thing of a part in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiralKnights" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiralKnights">Spiral Knights</a> where a chef states that he may have need a bit ambitious when he claimed that he could make a million cakes in a week,  so to speed things up he used dark matter instead of baking powder... This is my head canon for what happened with the MMMM cake. Mr and Mrs Cake weren't panicking that the cake could get damaged if it fell,  they were panicking that it would cause incredible damage to the town if it did. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            I'd go for a slice of that cake.  Eclairs are good,  but I don't feel like you can really improve on them that much.  The ones that griffon had looked basically like the ones you can get at the store.  And that moose just looked freaky.

            Honestly...I hesitate between the MMMM or the eclairs. And yet,  even if it sounded tasty as hell,  I'm quite sure the MMMM is the most "First bite is a glory,  Second is agony" cake ever.
