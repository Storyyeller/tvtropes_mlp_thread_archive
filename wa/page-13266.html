            @kegi: There's nothing wrong with playing a class in an unusual way. The only issue is that it can increase the difficulty. But it can be lots of fun. It's best to tie it into your character though. Why dos he wear armour? Is it an heirloom? Or maybe he's incredibly paranoid. If so,  he can focus on proective spells and you can  also continue playing to that theme. Or maybe he is irritated by the "wixards are wimpy nerds" stereotype and wants to prove that he can fight.

            An interesting system that could probably work for ponies is the system used by <a class="urllink" href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2012/12/24/star-wars-edge-of-the-empire">Star Wars: Edge of the Empire<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The dice don't do numbers. They simply do success/failure,  and a neat system of Advantage/Threat that adds to the action. For example,  you could succeed in unlocking a door with added Threat,  meaning that while you picked the lock,  a guard heard the noise and is suspicious. I haven't looked too far into things,  but it would definitely help to sort out all of the numbers upon numbers that tabletop games tend to devolve into.

            One other thing: You do not need a healer. In combat healing is a losing proposition in D&D because none of the healing spells except Heal heal enough to be worth it when you're sitting there taking damage. The best heal is to kill the opponent a round quicker. Outside of combat,  there are tons of ways to get cheap healing regardless of class.

Honestly,  I prefer the theory that there's nothing magic about The Stare. It plays off the subject's empathy and guilt,  so it didn't work on Discord because he's a sociopath.

Despite the craziness,  Ponyville is still Equestria's equivalent of a quiet rural town,  and when the main characters are supposed to be globetrotting pirates in a flying ship,  it wouldn't make any sense for them to give the town a second thought.</div>
<p></p>That reminds me of something I wrote elsewhere just yesterday:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Ponyville’s tourism board was not above using the truth <em>creatively</em> to promote their town. They could not,  in good conscience,  say that Ponyville was safer than any other city in Equestria. They could,  however,  point to the large percentage of Ponyville’s citizens who never bothered to lock their doors—and simply neglect to clarify that the dangers which <em>did</em> befall Ponyville were rarely the sort that could be deterred by a locked door.</div>

            I still don't see why people think it's even magic to begin with,  though. Usually,  when fanon runs wild with things,  it's from a tiny shred of evidence that gets expanded upon. Here,  not so much. Fluttershy needs magic powers,  I guess?

She is basically hyper sensitive to body language. And is able to almost perfectly read anypony through it. It's what lets her communicate with almost anything,  and one of the reasons she's so uncomfortable around new ponies,  or large groups,  she gets overloaded with information.
<p></p>The Stare is her doing the opposite,  not reading,  but simply projecting a sense of utter and total dominance,  every little muscle twitch,  expression,  her tone,  everything perfectly set to overload the targets subconscious with the fact the SHE is in charge,  till their will just breaks. Though she doens't have full control over it. She can do a weak Stare at will,  like with Discord,  but the full force one,  simply can't be forced,  it's almost subconscious on her own part.

            Said <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilEye" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilEye">Evil Eye</a> doesn't have any intimidation factor itself. It merely turns the target to stone. Outside of being put on a time limit,  it's no different than staring any other animal down. Not to mention that Fluttershy had to mix in threats and other forms of intimidation to finally scare it off.

            I admit that 4th ed has less customizability than 3.5. Multiclassing is done via feats and is a bit limited; you only get the most basic powers of the clas syou're taking (the Cleric feat gets you Healing Word,  the Wizard one gets you an at-will power as an Encounter power),  and it's really only good for taking on a different Paragon Path.
<p></p>However,  I still like 4.0. I've played a few campaings in it,  and the opportunity for good roleplaying and decent combat is all still there. It's less complex,  but that helps streamline it. I can scarcely express how much quicker it is to build encounters in 4.0.

            Fluttershy's ability with animals is probably magical,  but I too doubt that the stare is magical.  Didn't word of god even say that it isn't?
