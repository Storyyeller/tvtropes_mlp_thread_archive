            @Zel: Believe me,  watching the episodes just isn't the same as reading the synopsis.  Like half the episodes I thought were going to suck before I actually saw them. If you watch them and still dislike them,  that's fine,  but at least <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutShowsYouDontWatch" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutShowsYouDontWatch">give them a fair shot before denouncing them</a>.

            No. As I said before,  the opinions I held on the episode after reading the synopsis always stayed after watching the episode. While there may be one or two moments in it that I enjoy (as is with most of S2),  in the end,  I still won't like it. I know me. I won't like it.

            You know,  thinking about it,  I don't think watching it would help Zel at all. He'll be going into it with the plot spoiled and expecting to hate it. There's really no way that he <em>could</em> like it at this point. Looks like the same thing happened with the rest of Season 2. And this is why spoilers are bad.

            well DUH if you go in thinking your not going to like it you'll just make it a sefl fulfilling prophecy,  you'll nitpick the tiny things,  ignore anything good etc etc.. same issue Ginger has,  he wants everything o be to perfect,  any little issue gets exp[loded beyond measure and the good stuff gets brushed aside.
<p></p>and there's nothing wrong with season 2..other then a lack of real ensemble pieces. It's got some of the best damn episodes in the series so far.

            Zel,  I'm actually feeling torn here.  It ticks me off when people diss things just from summaries,  and yet... well,  I've been down the "I know myself,  I won't like it" road too.
<p></p>On the other hand,  I've also seen "I know myself" be completely,  utterly <em>wrong</em> too.  And this is the Season 2 finale,  so you should try it anyway no matter what your expectations are.  Those expectations could easily be wrong.

<p></p>The only thing in S2 that I even come close to calling into discontinuity is the whole "Spike turns giant when he gets greedy" thing,  if only because 1. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">it comes out of freaking nowhere</a> and 2. the show itself utterly ignores any and all implications of it.  Not to mention that Dragon Quest seemingly contradicts it anyway.  But even that isn't too bad.

            @Teeth: I've watched episodes 1-16. After that,  I couldn't stand it anymore so I gave up and just read the synopses. I was going to watch "It's About Time" but after I learned that the entire plot was caused by Twilight holding the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> in regards to the time travel spell,  I decided not to.

            Also,  I'm not saying every part of the episodes are bad. There are parts of the episodes that I have watched that are really good and there were bits that I read in the synopsis that I liked but,  all in all,  I don't think it would be enough to redeem it for me.

<p></p>@Zel: Twilight <em>didn't</em> have the idiot ball in that episode.  She received a message from her future self that implied an imminent disaster,  and her initial reaction really isn't that far off from how you'd expect someone to react.  By the time she really <em>does</em> start acting ridiculous,  she hasn't slept for about 4 days,  and we know from Applebuck Season what kind of effect that can have.

            @Zel It's About Time was Twilight acting reasonable given the circumstances,  and at the end when she gets goofy,  it's because she got hit on the head and hadn't slept for three days. I don't really see an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> there at all. These are the kind of things that you miss if you don't watch it. It is far easier to have everything make sense when the details are all there,  rather than compressed/discarded like they are with a synopsis.

            <div class="quoteblock">@Teeth: I've watched episodes 1-16. After that,  I couldn't stand it anymore so I gave up and just read the synopses. I was going to watch "It's About Time" but after I learned that the entire plot was caused by Twilight holding the Idiot Ball in regards to the time travel spell,  I decided not to. </div>
<p></p>So.. Zelenal... can I take it that you are also on the sadly short list of people who thinks Season One was superior to Season Two?
<p></p>I actually kind of agree about declaring much of Season 2 to be Discontinuity,  I just don't think the Finale should be one of those things.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">They do so why bring it up?</div>
<p></p>Context: Someone asked if Season Two brought up anything "so canon-shattering" that anyone would want to call it Discontinuity.  I brought that up as an example.
