            My mom has a degree in Library Sciences (I think that's what it's called) and my dad is a copywriter at an advertising agency. The next step up in math classes for me was trigonometry,  and my mom flat out told me if I wasn't going into a math-heavy career,  then I shouldn't waste my time with it.

            Honestly,  I think I could've handled pretty much any subject except math. I could probably <em>do</em> it,  but I'd hate every moment. The main reason I sucked at math in high school so badly was because I could almost never get past the first few problems without going "<em>I don't give a crap what X is!  Why am I trying to find X when I could be doing </em>literally anything else<em> with my time</em>?"
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Just because it works that way in that movie doesn't mean it works that way <em>in every cartoon ever</em>.  By that logic,  applying gamma rays to any character in any movie ever means that they would give superpowers.  Roger Rabbit and MLP are completely different works that function on completely different rules.

<p></p>Every character gets the physics of their native universe. That's just <em>logic</em>. If you don't do that,  then you litterally can't compare any fictional characters unless they're from the same universe.
<p></p>EDIT: As said,  we're looking at what they're capable of doing. If the reason they're cpable of doing that is because of their universe's rules <em>who cares</em>?

<p></p>Um,  that's <em>exactly</em> the point I'm trying to make.  You <em>can't</em> compare fictional characters against each other for specifically that reason.  The only way to do so is to create your own cosmology that defines how each character's native physics manifests when it interacts with physics from another universe.
<p></p>It's why Superman Vs. Goku will never be resolved: the Superman universe and Dragonball Z universe don't have the same physics,  so unless you can agree on what type of physics you're using,  you can never truly compare them.

            Again <em>it doesn't matter how other works of fiction treat it</em>. If MLP shows that Pinkie can use <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToonPhysics" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToonPhysics">Toon Physics</a> at random due to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>,  that's how it works in the MLP universe.
<p></p>If another work plays <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToonPhysics" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToonPhysics">Toon Physics</a> seriously with a clearly delineated set of rules,  that's how it works in that universe.
<p></p>Whether or not "some works" of fiction treat <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToonPhysics" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToonPhysics">Toon Physics</a> seriously is irrelevant. The only relevant piece of information is "does <em>MLP</em> treat <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToonPhysics" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToonPhysics">Toon Physics</a> seriously?"  If not,  I'm not going to attempt to figure out exactly how it works.  Given that the show's general explanation for how Pinkie's abilities work is "because Pinkie Pie" that's how I'm going to treat it.

            And the sonic rainboom wasn't treated seriously? Celestia's ability to move the sun isn't treated seriously? Discord's csual violation of reality isn't treated seriously?
<p></p>And again,  you're ignoring a simple and obvious solution I mentioned at the beggining. If they can do it in their native universe,  they're treated as <em>always</em> being able to do it.It's as simple as that!

            What I'm saying is that you're assuming a lot of information about the physics behind how those things work that we have no info for.
<p></p>Let's take one example: the sun.
<p></p>Here's what we <em>know</em> about it:
<p></p>1. It exists.
<p></p>2. Celestia moves it
<p></p>3. An unspecified number of unicorns are capable of moving it
<p></p>4. Discord is capable of moving it.
<p></p>5. It provides enough light and heat for the planet to survive.
<p></p>That's it.  That's the sum total of knowledge about the sun.  Everything else is conjecture based on those points.  We have no idea how big it is or how much magic it takes to move.  It's treated seriously from a <em>narrative</em> standpoint in that it's used to cause tension,  but never at any point does the show attempt to provide any scientifically rigorous information on how it works or how Celestia is able to move it other than "she can,  okay?"  We don't know whether real world physics apply to it.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> If they can do it in their native universe,  they're treated as always being able to do it. It's as simple as that! </div>
<p></p>I'm not even sure what you're trying to say here.  If they can do it in the show,  obviously they can do it.  I'm not arguing that.  What I <em>am</em> arguing is the mechanism behind the abilities.  I.e. Celestia being able to move the sun <em>in Equestria</em> has absolutely no bearing on whether she could move the sun in another universe.  They're different suns which exist in universes with different laws of physics.
