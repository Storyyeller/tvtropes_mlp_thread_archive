            I'm sorry; it was my fault entirely.
<p></p>See,  I used to be on an anti-seizure medication but it stopped working properly,  so they set me up with something new.
<p></p>Now,  before I couldn't drink anything alcoholic at all and knew this,  thus I have very little experience with it. Since going on my new medication I've gone an entire year without a seizure and decided to celebrate. I bought myself a bottle of hard cider,  since I thought I could now drink the stuff. I didn't want anything overly complex,  since,  as I said,  I'm new to this.
<p></p>I've tried (non-alcoholic) beer,  but despised the taste,  so I went with the cider. That was a mistake and entirely mine due to not investigating. One of the medicines I take (valproic acid) has,  as a side-effect,  mood swings. Now,  as far as these side effects go none of the side-effects occur with me,  except for a short bout of dizziness,  but after I'd had the bottle I got kicked with a mood swing. Hard.
<p></p>In essence I had a socialpathic episode. I came down just about nine last night and completely realized what I'd just done. I then spent the next twelve hours sleeping.
<p></p>But 'I was drunk' isn't and never will be an excuse. Despite the unforeseen side effect (which was also my fault for not checking) I bought the bottle and I drank it.
<p></p>I openly and humbly apologise to one and all for my actions and will accept any punishment seen fit to offer me. I deserve it.

<p></p>I'm kind of in a abusive relationship right now with this whole fandom. I can't go to one image gallery (like the KYM one) or other pony related site without encountering either R34,  hidden political jabs,  or other random argumentative crap. It's also populated with people who have issues or habits I really,  really don't want to hear about (or know they exist),  and those who are arrogant jerks. I know,  "welcome to the internet". I'm just bothered that this fandom pats themselves on the back for being nice and all,  but the truth is,  bronies are no different than all the other nuts out there,  they just do a better job of hiding it.
Sorry guys.

It is better to know that it wasn't directly your fault I guess. (A medication I once took made me incredibly depressed. I don't take Any medication if I can help it now.) Now you know to not do that,  and you are a little bit wiser. You are genuinely sorry anyway,  so even If it was directly your fault,  I would forgive. ^_^
<p></p>And besides,  It doesn't look like Apple it permanently banned,  so no harm done.
<p></p>So,  long story short,  We forgive you.

<p></p>Bronies seem to be at that point where the ratio of jackasses to nice people is too damn high.  Probably doesn't help that the fact that bronies generally want to be thought of as nice marks the fandom with a giant target for trolls.
<p></p>@Rich: As has been said,  I'd PM Syd and Applelight,  as they're the ones who were most affected by the whole thing.

<p></p>Either way,  Wazk,  I have to agree with you.  Being part of any particular fandom isn't going to magically make people on the internet better; I do have to say that we,  specifically of the TVTropes forum,  are generally kinder than other boards I've been a part of.  I'm not saying we don't have issues,  but people seem more genuinely sorry about what they've said and done (for the most part).  I guess it really just comes down to being more willing to forgive?

            I think the main difference between Bronies and other fandoms is that generally they want to seem actively nice,  instead of just another fanbase.
<p></p>That and the biggest jackasses would not join the fandom due to "LOL GAY!"
<p></p>They are not perfect,  but they are better than many.
<p></p>Then again,  the last fandom I was in was the sonic fanbase,  which is a bad one by any standard so I may not be the best judge...

            @Waz: You disagree with what,  the fact that there's perceived hypocrisy on the part of the fans for general not liking r34,  or you disagree with the idea that r34 should be tolerated by the fandom?
<p></p>(Also,  one needs to keep in mind that "tolerate" =/= "agreeing with" or "liking")
<p></p>And for the record,  my stance on that sort of stuff is that if it floats your boat fine,  but keep it to yourself rather than bothering people who would rather not sexualize the cast.
