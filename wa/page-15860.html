            I only give the ponies a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge">Vague Age</a>,  even in head canon. If I had to pin it down I'd say the CMC are 10 to 13 since they're just kids,  Pinkie,  Twilight and Dash are around 16 (Pinkie is childish,  Twilight is a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a> and Dash... I dunno),  Fluttershy,  AJ and Rarity are 17 to 18 (mostly due to their jobs).

            Yeah,  I tend to stick with <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge">Vague Age</a> as well. Personally I see the CMC as being in the 8-12 range,  whereas the mane cast are around 18-24.  Although within that I see the cast as all being the same age within a year or two.
<p></p>Also,  I'd love to have a Rarity and Pinkie episode.  Or maybe AJ and Pinkie. They don't interact enough.

<p></p>Another Pixiv fancomic set. Looks like Pinkie is a little too clingy in there. Also,  welp,  Cupcakes incoming?

            I can't see teenage for most of them. Twilight's academic position,  prior to the season 4,  struck me as being the equivalent of a grad student working on her thesis. Meanwhile,  we've got Rarity,  who owns and operates her own business,  and Applejack,  who is working full time for the family trade. They give off the feeling of being adults,  to me.
<p></p>Speaking of the family business,  I was thinking it might be interesting to see an episode where the Apple family is considering holding interview for a new worker for Sweet Apple Acres. The conflict would probably be Applejack being reluctant about the idea,  as the family business has always been just that.

            @Enlong: Rarity and AJ are definitely the oldest. Twi's a little on the young side,  still a little naive and inexperienced and unsure of herself,  her position as postgrad/princess trainee is due to her personal tutelage under Celestia and being effectively a prodigy.

            Friend in Deed is now done my thoughts on it? Eh it's a Pinke episode and is it me or does Pinkie seem a bit more on the annoying side as season 2 progresses? Could be just me but I am starting to notice the contrast between how she acted in season 1 to this very episode. But anyways the episode was just meh for me and god damn it that freaking Smile song is gonna be in my head now! Bloody earworm song that is and RHINOX! He-he-hey I haven't heard Richard Newman's voice in years now! Last time I heard his voice was on the remake of Punch-Out for the Wii. God and it's like Beast Wars was never cancelled. And here he is: voicing Cranky on here,  awesome stuff. Can't really say much about this episode it's a Pinkie Pie episode and it would've helped if this episode ended sooner other that,  eh.

            @Enlong: The idea of the Apple family hiring a new worker would be an interesting story.  I'm not sure quite how Applejack would react,  she may be outright offended if it's something that is decided without her input if she thinks that she's being replaced or that her family doesn't think she's good enough.  On the other hand,  she might do just fine in a tutor/mentor role if she also agreed on adding more workers and was part of the decision-making process.  It would also depend on how competent the new worker was as well (either extreme might annoy Applejack,  someone who just messes up at everything would obviously be a problem but she might get jealous of someone who outperforms her at farming).
<p></p>On the subject of a different pony,  I was wondering where the idea of associating Vinyl Scratch specifically with dubstep music came from.  She isn't necessarily shown playing that style of music in the show itself,  although she is given a "wild rocker" kind of appearance in the way she looks.

<p></p>Fluttershy? WHAT JOB? It seems like she takes care off the animals for kicks. Plus,  topics like this always piss me of for some reason. If a character's age is unknown,  we should assume they're the same age instead of the writer forcing ages on the groups. "Age is just a number" I like to think.

            Well,  that was the point,  right? She was to learn that the way she was acting (assuming everyone wants to be her friend,  thinking that apologizing alone is always enough to be forgiven) was wrong. wha she did at the end was better,  in that she wasn't trying to get anything <em>out</em> of it,  and was just making one last attempt to make him happy.

            @Friend In Deed: I HATED HATED HATED that episode when it first aired,  partially because when I read the episode description preview and thought "well,  they wouldn't be stupid enough to have Pinkie pester someone into being her friend" and then I was angry when they did exactly that.  Especially because Pinkie's actions don't fit the moral she says at the end,  about letting others have their privacy.
<p></p>However,  I ended up having some <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> (or Fridge Relief,  the opposite of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a>) about it.  First of all,  Pinkie would understandably have a hard time even understanding why anyone would WANT to be alone,  since she's terrified of being abandoned,  so her being clingy and not understanding what "leave me alone" means is pretty much in character for her.  I guess then I also had to think to myself,  "Why did Cranky actually end up calling Pinkie his friend?  What did he like about her?"  And then I realized a few things.  One is that he would have at least admired her persistence,  even if it meant she was chasing him,  because he had also been very persistent in searching for Matlida most of his life.  Plus,  she did happen to reunite him with the lost love he had been searching for,  so that would also mean he would be grateful to her for that.  It's still one of my least favorite episodes of the entire series,  though.  At least it gave me the perfect song for my dog Luna,  because the Smile song perfectly fits her sweet and "cheers everyone up" personality.

            Yeah,  Fluttershy may not necessarily earn any money by taking care of those animals,  but it's a huge amount of responsibility. :/ that,  plus that one line from canon,  is why I think she's one of the older ones.

            She pestered him into never wanting to see her again,  actually. And that was the point,  wasn't it? What she was doing prior to thr end was selfish and just made things worse.
<p></p>It was only at the end of the episode that she go the point,  and did something to make <em>him</em> happy,  instead of expecting something (friendship,  forgiveness) in return.
<p></p>I feel that the end of the episode is more about Cranky's reward than Pinkie's.
