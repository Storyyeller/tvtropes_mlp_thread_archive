            Also,  Mousa is entitled to hate any pony he wants.
<p></p>Edit: his friend came to the hatch with his girlfriend.  The two of them had me running around like an idiot,  and when I asked them to repeat their order,  she asked him was I simple.  And he replied that no,  I was a dick.
<p></p>Afterwards,  I reminded him who I was.  And then I said I'd see him tomorrow.  Craped.  His.  Pants.

            I have to admit that I'm not a huge fan of Rarity.   Thankfully,  her character depth does manage to make a bit of an interesting character.  Unfortunately,  her attention-seeking qualities and her tendency to exaggerate things beyond understandable limits relegate her to status of the pony I like the least.  I'm still able to tolerate her though because the other elements of her character lend some balance to her and her behavior.

            I like rarity just because she avoids certain stereotypes (See: <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>). Her flaws are also believable if a bit dramatic.

            Rarity is my least favorite of the ponies as well.  I don't dislike her at all,  but she's the last one I'd choose to hang out with.  Sorry Rare,  I just don't think we'd have anything to talk about.

            I wouldn't be able to exchange 5 words with Rarity. I'd have nothing to say to her.
<p></p>Everyone seems to have been surprised by her not being like her stereotype. I never got that at all. I ALWAYS knew she was nice.

            I don't think I'd have very much to say to Rarity.  I guess we could talk some about art,  but that'd probably be about the extent of it.

            There is very little gap in how much I like my favorite of the Mane 6 and my least favorite. That said,  Rarity is tied with Dash for favorite,  ATM. I've enjoyed her episodes the most (A Dog and Pony Show is still my favorite episode outside the recent finale),  and she's definitely the deepest out of all of them.
