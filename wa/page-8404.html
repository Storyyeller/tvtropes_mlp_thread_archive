            <div class="quoteblock">2. Littlepip is inconsistently characterized. For example,  chapter 4 largely consists of her scavenging weapons and armor. Then in chapter 5 when she's in the stable with Calamity the narration (see point 3) gives us a pang of outrage at how Calamity is looting the place. Might've been a nice spot for introspection and character development,  but then in chapter 6 she's right back to fishing through the bodies of the slavers she guns down. So all it does is make her look like a bit of a hypocrite. Similar problem arises with the way the story tries to present Littlepip as a paragon of goodness and compassion and then has her being extraordinarily ruthless to her enemies (the whole "gunning down a terrified,  fleeing raider" bit in chapter 3 left a bad taste in my mouth). </div>
<p></p>She only complained about looting the stable because it was a stable and reminded her of home.

            Yeah that' one of the great things about the fic,  you DON'T need to kow the fallout games to get it,  sure it gives you a better understdning of somethings,  but it's not required.

            So,  can we switch the topic to something else now? Like maybe we could talk about Sonic or the Mario videos games for instance. I certainly have something negative to say about the Sonic Archie comics.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
