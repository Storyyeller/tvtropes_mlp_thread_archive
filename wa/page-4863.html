            In mathematics,  an antimatroid is a formal system that describes processes in which a set is built up by including elements one at a time,  and in which an element,  once available for inclusion,  remains available until it is included. Antimatroids are commonly axiomatized in two equivalent ways,  either as a set system modeling the possible states of such a process,  or as a formal language modeling the different sequences in which elements may be included. Dilworth (1940) was the first to study antimatroids,  using yet another axiomatization based on lattice theory,  and they have been frequently rediscovered in other contexts;[1] see Korte et al. (1991) for a comprehensive survey of antimatroid theory with many additional references.
<p></p>The axioms defining antimatroids as set systems have some similarity to those of matroids,  but whereas matroids can be defined by an exchange axiom (e.g.,  the basis exchange,  or independent set exchange axioms),  antimatroids can be defined instead by an anti-exchange axiom,  from which their name derives. Antimatroids can be viewed as a special case of either greedoids or semimodular lattices,  and as a generalization of partial orders and distributive lattices. Antimatroids are also complementary to convex geometries,  a combinatorial abstraction of convex sets in geometry.
<p></p>Antimatroids have been applied to model precedence constraints in scheduling problems,  potential event sequences in simulations,  task planning in artificial intelligence,  and the states of knowledge of human learners.

<p></p>Not many. Well,  from the same artist as my avatar is a ponified VARIA SUITED Samus. It looks... weird. Also,  I think someone did a ponified Ridley and the Metroids themselves.

            Well,  the VARIA Suit's shoulders are cumbersome enough for a human's shoulders.  If what are essentially the hips had to be VARIA'd as well... yeah,  I can see how that'd be weird.

            Well,  it's odd,  because you see the word antimatroid is essentially the opposer to matroid,  which is one letter away from Metroid. So that's why it makes me want to play it.

            Admit it storyyeller,  the room you are currently in is full of databases and computers and all of that junk. And maybe some antimatroids,  whatever the hell those are.
