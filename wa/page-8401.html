<p></p>Welcome by the way,  Blissey. Boast Busters has garnered a bit of critism with many fans,  so don't feel alone. Some of the episodes are a little goody goody with Aesops,  but there's always a lot of humor and characterization to balance it off.

            Well,  it also helps my head cannon on unicorn spells is that they aren't totaly physically unable to learn a spell not directly related to there special talent,  (though yes some spells will be impossible for them,  it's just due to how much raw power the spell needs,  or they just are not mentally able to channel the spell becuase they dn't think the way it requires). it's just a lot harder for them learn/use them,  and there is generally a mental block to it,  hence velvet trying to justify how it ties in,  she was doing it for herself wthout knowing to bypass the mental block.

            <div class="quoteblock">Well,  it also helps my head cannon on unicorn spells is that they aren't totaly physically unable to learn a spell directly related to there special talent,  (though yes some spells will be impossible for them,  it's just due to how much raw power the spell needs,  or they just are not mentally able to channel the spell becuase they dn't think the way it requires). it's just a lot harder for them learn/use them,  and there is generally a mental block to it,  hence velvet trying to justify how it ties in,  she was doing it for herself wthout knowing to bypass the mental block.</div>Uhhhh...

            @Seraph Well,  in that case we're just going to have to agree to disagree. I felt the explanation of what spells a Unicorn could learn was rather well spelled out in Boast Busters. Not to mention the fact that FE also explicitly spells out in story that Unicorns can only learn spells related to their talents (with Velvet being the one giving the exposition,  for additional irony).

            The only explanation I can think of for Velvet knowing a force field spell is if we're going by RPG logic wherein the party healer is also the one who does defensive spells or something.

            again,  head cannon.
<p></p>but really,  it's not like any unicorn can actually learn that much,  like i said the major blockage is mental not physical,  except in terms or raw power. A pony has to able to focus there mental energy in a very specific way in order to cast any spell...hence Twilight never has to do anything beyond concentrate to cast a spell,  no words,  incantations,  components etc...the vast vast majority simply do not have the required mental wiring to think the way required for most spells,  just those related to there special talent,  which in turn is related to there personality,  and hence,  there thoughts.
<p></p>so by that,  it's not there special talent that defines there spells,  it's there overall mental makeup that defines both there spells and there special talent.

            The forcefield isn't what bothers me. It's the fact that her special talent is explicitly singing,  not medicine. She says that she always wanted to be a doctor,  but her cutie mark hampered that. If she didn't want to be a singer,  she wouldn't have gotten the mark. Either she's special and gets to break the established rules,  or her cutie mark is wrong. Neither of those explanations sit well with me.
<p></p>@Seraph Then you're just going to have to accept that your explanation doesn't fly with us.
