She's usually pretty good at making everypony else happy,  so seeing her be that insensitive was just weird.  That said,  the episode did have some good points.  "Smile Smile Smile" being a good example.  And most of the jokes in that episode were pretty good when Pinkie wasn't flagrantly invading his privacy.

            Yeah,  she was pretty bad,  but that was the point. I felt that the episode did a pretty good job of elaborating on the fact that she very much can be annoying without realizing. There's a reason that RD was running away from her Griffin the Brush Off,  and it's the same reason that she messed up at the Gala,  too.

            Aside from Pinkie's slightly out-of-character blindness to his annoyance,  I feel like AFID is one of my favorite Pinkie episodes.  She really is sweet when she's not just a Looney Tunes cutout (like in "The Last Roundup",  which handled her terribly).

            It wouldn't have bugged me as much if it hadn't ended up <em>working</em>.  As is,  she basically just kept pressing and it ended up working out for her.  It made the point of the episode less "some people need their space" and more "if you pester them long enough you'll eventually be able to make them like you".  The episode actually points out that Pinkie is being overbearing,  and then she just keeps acting the same way.  If she had actually given Cranky his space and gotten on his good side that way,  this would probably be one of my favorite episodes.
<p></p>Also,  I didn't think she was handled that badly in The Last Roundup because everyone reacted appropriately to her rambling.

            "A Friend In Deed" basically made a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a> out of Pinkie's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultChild" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultChild">Adult Child</a> status...or is that Mare-Foal status? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin">
<p></p>I've always thought of Deconstruction as "play a trope so straight that you see realistic consequences,  and the flaws in it". Oh,  and if you don't like what you see,  don't worry! They intentionally make it so that you don't like what you see...because if they didn't,  you would get <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">Misaimed Fandom</a>!
<p></p>Personally,  I think Pinkie needs to grow up a little. As much as I like her,  AFID and "Baby Cakes" made it clear that her immaturity causes problems at times! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">

            I just hated how Pinkie tortured Applejack.  It was a cruel invasion of privacy and almost made me ragequit the show.
<p></p>Especially because my little sister is just like Pinkie Pie and has done that very thing to me (I still love her to death,  though).

            I agree that AJ's decision to abandon Ponyville for a while was a massive overreaction,  but it doesn't justify their decision to basically try to force it out of her.  Not to mention that she never really said how long she intended on staying away.  She definitely needed a smack upside the head,  but it just bugs me that her friends jump to trying to annoy her into submission when she clearly would rather not talk about it.

Still after ratcheting up the annoyance at the last part only for the conflict to be rather convinentley resolved left me rather disappointed.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">It was a big error on her part to needlessly worry her friends and family out of her own pride. However her friends also approached it in a rather selfish fashion,  wanting her to come home with and making her "confess" them rather then finding out what was actually wrong.

AJ was obviously being too stubborn about the whole deal,  but I think everyone else should have taken a more subdued approach than "If you don't want to tell us we'll make you tell us".  Like a "everybody in the town misses you and wants you to come back" type of thing.
