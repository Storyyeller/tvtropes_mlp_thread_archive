            Eh,  in general I've prefered Pinkie's later portrayel. Episodes like Party of One and Baby Cakes were good for her.
<p></p>But Moe and I apparently have incredibly different tastes and opinions.
<p></p>EDIT: Pinkie found a sword and was challenged by her past self for it using dice rolls. Her past self won and so she got to steal it.

            To me,  Pinkie is slowly becoming less Cartoon character,  and more human (well,  pony). We just need a good down to earth episode for her now.

            Pinkie I admit comes off the most one dimentional in a comparative case,  since the other ponies have a few more realistic traits to balance their wacky ones. Stand alone,  I think she's okay,  she could use some more layers of depth and her comic relief does get kinda obnoxious at times,  but her spotlight episodes develop her a bit,  especially since,  like other lead ponies,  she's made into a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt Monkey</a> and gains pathos a lot of the time (A Friend In Deed was in fact my first fully watched episode).
<p></p>Also the world doesn't always cater to her whim in Season Two,  she's made to look rather dumb in Mmmystery. I just think they're trying to add a two sided dimention to her eccentricness and Twilight being her <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolandersMinder" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolandersMinder">Cloud Cuckoolanders Minder</a>. I find it more milti faceted than the usual scenario of the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a> always being right and Pinkie's craziness always being wrong (or vise versa).

            I suppose for a more 'down to earth' episode,  they could pair her with another even crazier character than herself,  which could show her clarity without making her turn OOC. Sorta like Spongebob with Patrick.
