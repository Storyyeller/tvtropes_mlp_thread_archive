            Hello everyone! I see that a lot of you enjoyed the episode!
<p></p>Anything stand out here that I should know about?
<p></p>Also,  did Ginger dislike how Celestia was basically owned by the Changeling Queen or not? And was I the only one who was wondering where the hell Luna was in the middle of the wedding? XD

            I would actually LOVE it for Fausticorn to show up,  but only if it's done very VERY well,  like in the series Finale. Preferably as the Sisters mother,  with some very heartwarming dialog that while between her and the ponies,  doubles as a thank you both from the fans to Faust/other show runners,  and From Faust/et al the fans.

            @Ilse: Ginger was okay with it,  as long as we agreed it was because Chrysalis was super-powerful and not because Celestia was weak (which I wholeheartedly agree is the case).
<p></p>Also,  I figure Luna physically can't function during the daytime.  Not yet,  anyway.

            I thought it was probably within SA's power. I mean,  he's probably from a family of really powerful and/or wealthy unicorns. Plus,  Twilight can freaking turn her parents into cacti and Spike into a full grown dragon... AS A FOAL. I think it's within his power,  especially if it is his special talent.
<p></p>@ Ginger: That's how someone else worded it. They were happy about it. I wanted to stand up for her,  but I barely knew the guy so I couldn't be mean... <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue"> But she almost won. And it was already established that she is not as strong as the elements anyway. And I guess Love + Friendship &gt; Celestia

            So,  any word on who Cadence's VA is? She does a really good job this episode,  going back and forth between the sinister,  passive aggressive tone Fake!Cadence to sweet,  concerned,  and sad both when Fake!Cadence pulls the drama card and for the real Cadence. If she also voices the Changeling Queen (and I think she does,  the voice doesn't change that much),  then even more props to her.

            Yeah,  that shield spell is a little overpowered for one unicorn.  Until we see otherwise,  I'm going to headcanon that the absurd power of it is balanced by it being his only spell.  Although he can probably make it smaller for personal shields.

            I honestly think a cameo was about the most we could hope for from Luna.
<p></p>Though I do wonder why Shining Armor was the only one who could make that spell? There must be some reason beyond his cutie mark. . .or not.

            I guess one of my personal hopes is for a next season (which is being created now) to have an actual story arch. I think after two years of this show being on they can finally attempt it. May not happen but it would be interesting if like there was,  at least,  a small side story that plays out through out the season and is resolved in the finally. Not counting on it but it would be nice.

            To be fair,  Ginger,  SA has probably had pretty extensive training in that one single area. I mean,  look at hi CM - he obviously specializes in defense. I imagine he's got a good bit of potential too,  it's just easier for him to direct it. Besides,  Twi's gotten pretty proficient at popping,  and that can't be easy.
<p></p>Besides,  SA probably has Cadence as an Amp too. At least for building it - maintaining it probably doesn't take as much power as the initial build.

            @Red My idea was that she was put to sleep WHILE SHE WAS ALREADY ASLEEP. To keep her that way.
<p></p>Taken by a spell while you're asleep doesn't make one look bad in my opinion.

            Perhaps they thought that having another scene where Luna comes in and gets curbstomped was just unnecessary after the Queen defeated Celestia.

            Maybe Luna was away working? Or doing some sort of business? Maybe she didn't go to the wedding cause she was afraid to make a scene? Or maybe it was just <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>?

When not even TWO alicorns working together can defeat the queen,  you know you're in deep doo-doo. And it would also reinforce the message that the Power of Love is the greatest thing ever.
