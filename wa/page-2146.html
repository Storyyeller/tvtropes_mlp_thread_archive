            Amazing! Pics are amazing,  so happy right now. So we'll see the play being acted,  but also the backstory itself,  with the Mane 6 as the people in it... cool!
<p></p>I'd join the people saying that both Alicorn sisters being in the episode is guaranteed. Maybe even both in and out of the play. (Discord in the flashback? John DeLancie having giving them one or two extra lines? Wouldn't rule it out completely)
<p></p>Really crazy idea: the Mane 6 FINALLY get more respect and recognition from everypony,  which is why they're asked to do the play. If there are more occurences of arrogant snobs not knowing who they are after they've performed in the Main Hall of the Land Capitol RIGHT NEXT to stained glass windows depicting their double world saving shenanigans,  then.... uhh... gah.

            That's sort of missing the point. The real issue with the argument is that,  in a world where its deinziens are regularly and naturally clad in such colours as blue,  green yellow and <em>hot pink</em>,  what the hell is colour supposed to mean?
<p></p>There's also the fact of <em>why in the name of god two slaves would be decked out in solid gold armour</em>,  but hey.

            Some stupid crap about the show not having black ponies even though why would ponies directly correlate to human racial features?  Then noticing that the only black ponies are Celestia's guards,  even though they're grey and somehow being a guard makes you a slave.  Also something about Rainbow being gay because of the rainbow motif and the tomboyishness.

            @Death: Well,  yes,  I agree ^^.  The chances are minuscule,  but... well,  I'm normally such a pessimist,  but this show brings out my inner optimist ^^. So I'm gonna hold out a little bit of hope. Maybe not that Discord will speak.. but he may be seen very quickly or at least mentioned in the telling of the backstory.

            Welp,  I just decided I was gonna try hopping over onto ponychan to see if there was anything that would interest me. Saw one thread talking about why AJ doesn't deserve to be a main character,  one demanding people show what's so great about Earth Ponies and basically refusing to believe they were worth spit,  one complaining about a recent episode,  one complaining about Pinkie Pie's fans,  and one calling Scoots and Sweetie Bell stupid.
<p></p>Yup,  not doing that again. I think I'll just stick to nice,  rational,  positive <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropes">TV Tropes</a>. I love you guys.

            Sorry to interject,  but I feel like getting this off my chest. (I was previously x86x but lost the password) Somehow,  it seems that Treehouse has managed to neglect MLP even more than before (3 per week on Treehouse as compared to 22 per week on the Hub) So,  it's Christmas time once again,  and the station airs specials which take some of the regular programs' spots. However,  here,  they stop caring and just decide to knock out two of MLP's 3 slots in one go and replace them with specials. For Dec 19-Dec 26,  the Wednesday 6:30 slot is taken up by Santa Claus Is Coming to Town while it's 9:30 slot on the same day is taken up by a double-length Dora The Explorer special,  this leaving only ONE time to watch the show during that period,  which of course is at 5:30 am on Monday morning. You'd think that since it's animated in Canada,  it would get more appreciation from the network. Also,  I've noticed this strange habit that MLP seems to be having a tug-of-war to get its Sunday 4pm slot. Every Sunday at that time,  it alternates between MLP and The Wiggles. It can never really decide. Oh,  and Season 2 still hasn't aired yet over here.

It is a play after all,  so it's probably an extreme oversimplification of events,  or based on legends of the events.  Not that I don't want some history,  but I'm sure this episode will give us plenty of wiggle room for fanon.
