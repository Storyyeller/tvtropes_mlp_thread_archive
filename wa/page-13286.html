            Okay,  is it just me,  or does the guy who wrote that article know way too much about obscure sections of the pony fandom for someone who supposedly hates it?  I mean Fallout Equestria is pretty big,  but Hoofbeats?  Some weird random Raginsemi fic?  You're spending a lot of time trawling through the dregs of the fandom for someone who doesn't like ponies.

            The horn serves as a channel and focusing point for the magic,  allowing its power to be amplified and used properly. The unicorn can use the magic even without the horn,  but it won't be well-controlled and won't be nearly as potent.
<p></p>So,  I just realized we're now less than 48 hours away from another new episode. If I recall correctly,  this next one has something to do with Spike,  but I don't recall exactly what,  and I think right now I'll just sort of let myself be surprised for once,  and not read too closely any preview information. I never read actual spoilers anyway.

            Which only makes the fact that they didn't present one of the worse ones even weirder. I mean,  the stuff you can find on Fimfic's front page in any hour can be a terror. Clicking on random new fics is like playing Russian roulette with your sanity.
<p></p>Also,  if I wanted to be a unicorn I'd have to figure out what am I first.

            @Orion: Personal fanon here: Effectively nothing. Unicorns have a holistic connection to magic,  but lack the inherent connection that <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs">E Ps</a> and Pegasi have. In order for a unicorn to use magic,  they first need to connect to the energy of the object they're going to manipulate. This require an intense amount of concentration,  because picking out the energy of one single object in amidst everything else is near impossibly difficult on its own,  and then they have to go the extra mile of actually focusing their entire self on it in order to affect any meaningful change.
<p></p>The horn is a work-around. It's a focal point that a unicorn inherently understands,  just the same as people inherently understand their limbs. sure we have to learn to use them properly,  but they're a part of us. So a unicorn uses their horn as a sort of path to push and pull magic in order to effectively manipulate objects. In theory it's possible that a unicorn can learn to manipulate objects sans horn by focusing on another part of themselves - eyes,  hooves,  their nose,  a lock of hair,  etc. With proper training a unicorn could even learn to do it <em>without</em> a focal point,  unlocking an enormous range of magical potential. Such a feat however would require a unicorn to do the exact opposite of what they've learned to do their entire life,  which is to detach themselves from the concept of focus altogether,  and simply to know and exist. This is why Pumpkin Cake demonstrated such intense magic in Baby Cakes: Babies lack the sense of self required for focus,  but still intuitively understand magic. So,  they can perform feats that seem impossible by virtue of looking at magic as a whole rather than trying to single a piece of it out. the only thing that stops them from being apocolyptically destructive is that they also don't have the strength of will to effect magic in any meaningful way.

            @Seraphem: I recall Sergent Sprinkles saying in a old video interview that one of the reasons why he wrote <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cupcakes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cupcakes">Cupcakes</a> was to make a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take that</a> towards Pinkiedash shippers {That pairing had a huge increase in popularity around the time where he got the idea to make that infamous fanfic}. That wasn't his only reason,  but it was one of them. So in a way it did involve at least some trolling.
<p></p>That being said,  it's ovbious that the fic was done for lulz nonetheless The only things I really like about it are the Alternate Endings {Some of which are hilarious} and the funny fancomics that were based on it {Not to be confuses with the gorey fancomics <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">}.

            @Orion: My theory is that all ponies have the same basic magical field,  but that biological differences cause the magic to manifest differently.  Earth ponies don't focus the magic at all; so it's basically passive.  Pegasi magic is focused in the wings,  which is what allows for flight. It's slightly more active than EP magic in that pegasi can use it to manipulate objects (interacting with clouds,  towing objects in flight).  Unicorn magic is entirely active; they have the most control,  but unlike the other two races they have to actively cause their spells to take effect.  I could explain it in more detail,  but that's the basics.

            @Seraph: Speaking of denial,  I once saw another person on Fanfiction net critize a author for putting a brief pony refrence in a non-pony story,  and he then called ponys "The cancer of the internet". I checked out his FFN profile,  and guess what? I found nothing but a ton of pony fanfics in his faves,  and not a single one was a troll fic. Denial can be a weird thing at times.

            My headcannon is that all the above-average unicorns get sent to Canterlot or wherever the place is where Unicorns are trained to harness and constructively apply their power,  and are thus much more stable with their magic (no random uncontrollable outbursts of magic),  but much more rigid in their abilities (no random bursts of great magic,  or random bursts of magic outside their usual sphere of use).
<p></p>Sort of like languages,  once you get older,  you cannot learn languages as quickly or as well,  and you are more rigidly stuck in whatever language you do know; but within your vocabulary and sphere,  you're rather skilled.  Except if small children had random bursts of speaking swahili that could destroy a house.
<p></p>So,  most of them are taught how to avoid using their magic and prevent surges of magical power.  Sort of like an internal power inhibitor for safety.  Also,  most of them become specialized and,  with that specialization and training channeling all their energy into their chosen sphere,  they cannot do things outside their normal sphere.
<p></p>Very few unicorns,  in my Headcannon,  are trained to combat large disasters,  like the Ursa Minor and Major; the risk of those unicorns becoming a terrible threat themselves is too great for all but the least ambitious and most stable/trustworthy unicorns.
<p></p>Other unicorns are like giant power stations that are safely harnessed to do mundane things like powering everybody's houses and lightbulbs; harnessed/restrained for mundane utility. Twilight is like a bolt of lightning: sheer unharnessed power seeking a conduit.
