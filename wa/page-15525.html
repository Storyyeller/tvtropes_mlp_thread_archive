            Course,  the military probably goes through a mint on gold armour.
<p></p>On the plus side,  training your military in gold armour means that they barely notice steel armour.

            Given that the changelings had access to all of their information (Chrysalis could've easily mined Shining Armor for intel),  it's not really a good indication of their actual ability.  Although yeah,  they really don't have a good track record thus far.
<p></p>In other news,  the bound copy of my thesis came in.  It's really surreal seeing a bound book with your name on it.

            Ooooh,  sounds neat. What was your thesis on again?
<p></p>Also we didn't even see all that much of the guard during the invasion. They could have been doing well holding other parts of the city... I mean,  as well as could be expected.

            One wonders if the Canterlot royal guard is supposed to be primarily ceremonial,  and the regular Equestrian Military (if such a thing exist),  would have been more effective.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Well I guess we could assume that the guards we do see are amazingly incompetent. Though if we think too hard about the Changeling invasion we will quickly realize that. . .well they had ample warning before the attack and should have put up more of a defense.

            @Kegisak: The historical background of certain symbols used in the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBible" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBible">The Book of Revelation</a>.  Interesting stuff.
<p></p>@Mio: Yeah,  it's kinda hard to say,  given that we didn't really see the guards. We have no clue whether they were fighting,  or captured,  or trying to evacuate the city.
<p></p>Also,  it's possible that the Royal Guard is just that: a bodyguard.  They're trained to deal with isolated threats to the Princesses,  not large-scale invasions.

            I like,  and have as my headcanon,  the explanation for how the guard worked in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyLittleDenarians" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyLittleDenarians">My Little Denarians</a> that  their role when faced with any large/powerful force isn't to fight,  but simply to get the civilians out of the way as quickly as possible and set up a perimeter keeping ponies out of harms way,  while The Princesses deal with it.
<p></p>Outside of that they are really just there to help maintain order. hence guarding some important,  though not royalty related,  things. Just general crowd control and maintaining order.

            That seems to be what you guys describe a lot in the comics. TO the effect of not mch happens and not much substance or originality,  but a good job with the focus character's personality and good jokes.

            @dark: Which is weird since from what I have seen a lot happens in the comics,  but the characters are kind of on the one-dimensional and the jokes are rather obnoxious.

            Yeah,  I was at the comic writers panel,  at they flat out said,  after two heavy action/drama filled arcs,  they just wanted to spend some time doing something fun and happy and nonsensical,  and,  it really does work too.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Ummm,  no also at Dark. The characters all feel just as great and real as they do in the show,  and I don't get "nothing happens" plenty happens,  in every comic. Sure in the latest it was basically just big Mac getting into one wacky hijink after another,  but it was still things happening.

            @Dark: Nah,  I'd say plenty happens in the comics.  It's just that in this one in particular,  the entire plot is "Big Mac tries to go to the hardware store,  and the universe gets in his way".  Plenty of events happen,  but they're all very mundane and not really important outside of entertainment value.  Except for the bit where he stumbles through an interdimensional time portal and saves Ponyville from monkeys,  then returns five minutes before he left. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>@Mio: It really depends on which comics you're reading.  The first two arcs definitely had some character material (although it wasn't the driving force of the plot),  and most of the micro comics are entirely character-driven.

            Finished watching Party for one and to be honest I don't think I found much enjoyment in this one. Can I ask a question? Since Pinkie loves to throw parties and whatnot it's fine and dandy and all but don't you think the message was a bit forced? I know it might be me but why exactly did she forget her birthday,  why did Pinkie assume that she was being dumped by her friends? Granted they shouldn't have been making excuses about the party and being dishonest to her but why in god's name would she think that the other mane six would DITCH her as a friend?! Geez just overreaction overload! I dunno I just didn't like the episode and I'm not gonna hate anybody who likes Party for one but honestly I just didn't find it amusing.

She bases her entire self image and her own happiness,  on how she can make others feel,  and in having others being happy and liking her. As to her own Birthday,  well just chalk that up to yet another sign of just how much she puts everypony else ahead of herself,  she make sure to know the birthday of every single pony and non-pony in town,  and yet,  doesn't feel the need to keep track of her own.

            Basically,  in the latest comic Big Mac has to fix a gazebo. He's out of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">nails</a>,  so he has to go out to buy some more. Turns out the Summer Wrap Up Festival is going on,  and all of Ponyville is standing between him and the hardware store.
