            Unless there was a lot more to Sombra than we saw,  I imagine he couldn't have been THAT hard to take care of. Luna I'll grant you,  though. That one was basically a cosmic time out.

            Probably why she sent someone else to deal with it.

            @Kegisak: I see what you,  mean,  but I think there are logical explanations for all of those:
<p></p><ul><li>Nightmare Moon: It's pretty likely that letting her out and then blasting her with the elements was Celestia's plan from the start; there's no way she <em>wanted</em> permanently erase her sister.
<p></p></li><li>Discord: From what info we have,  it seems like she <em>thought</em> that sealing him with the elements was a permanent solution,  and she was surprised as anyone else when he broke out due to the elements changing bearers.  The reason she pawned him off on the cast is because the only thing that can defeat him is the elements,  and she doesn't have those anymore.  If she did,  she would have taken care of it herself.
<p></p></li><li>Sombra: Yeah,  I'm not sure what the deal is here.  Although I have to point out that Luna helped her with that,  and again they both seem pretty surprised when he shows up.  I doubt they intentionally just shoved him under the carpet and went "eh,  somepony else can deal with him". It's kinda the same as Discord; once he busts out,  best to leave it to the element bearers.

            @Crowfall: 1000 years ago,  Celestia had to be harsh on her enemies,  so word would get around that no-one should mess with her precious little ponies. It extends to corrupt nobles.

            @JT: Yeah,  those are the most likely reasons.
<p></p>I just like the idea of Celestia banishing the dishes for a thousand years. And then assigning the task of washing them to some random passing maid when they show up again.
<p></p>...And then the maid demonstrates how freaking badass she is by tackling them,  because it turns out a thousand years worth of old food plus magic has some weird-ass effects,  and Celestia is so impressed she keeps on giving the maid chore-related adventures based on shit she put off a thousand year ago. That would make for an interesting fanfic.

            Why do so many people think that Discord was defeated 1000 years ago? There is litterally zero indication of this. For all we know,  it was <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedakaBox" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedakaBox">3, 402, 193, 822, 311 Years and 287 Days</a> ago.
<p></p>As for Sombra, I thought it was pretty clear that they wanted it to be permanent for him as well,  but he was more powerful than they expected.
