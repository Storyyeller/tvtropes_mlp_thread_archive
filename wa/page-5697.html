            Hi everybody.
<p></p>Got to see the episode.  It was enjoyable.  I wonder how Feather Wing got in to get that picture of Celestia in the first place.  He must be a sneaky little pegasus or the guards at the palace are really lax.

            Odd like... I don't know. I suppose I should have expected it for a meetup,  but it feels like half the people took 'fandom' to 'obsession' levels. IT just felt awkward to me,  really.

            @Keg: You shouldn't be <em>too</em> surprised; the more obsessed fans are the ones who are most likely to take the time out of their schedules to go to a meetup.
<p></p>@Latenight: Or she visited the town at some point during the duration of the episode.  I mean,  they obviously didn't publish a dozen papers over the course of a few days.  Or it's just photoshopped.

            Yeah,  I agree that the town went a little overboard,  but it's not <em>that</em> bad.  Definitely no worse than other questionable stuff from the season.  And really,  if the CMC can get dirt on <em>Celestia</em>,  they can get dirt on anypony,  so the paranoia isn't exactly totally unfounded.  It's not like they exiled the girls or anything.

            We only saw like,  a few shots of the townsfolk... I'd call it plain paranoia,  not really hatred. I mean,  they <em>did</em> have the notebooks with them,  it's not hard to make an assumption from there...

            @L Mage: That wouldn't surprise me at all.
<p></p>I really don't think it was that bad.  And honestly,  a lot of the individual ponies had good reason to be angry about it.  I think Twilight's force field was massive overkill,  but stuff like AJ and Mac wasn't really that OOC.  The Apples are vary family oriented,  and AJ and BM are feeling personally betrayed; it isn't that much of an overreaction to want to be left alone by the person who caused the problem.
<p></p>And yeah,  I didn't really get hatred from it,  it was more like "Oh crap,  those fillies nearly ruined the reputations of a bunch of ponies!  I'm not letting that happen to me." than anything else.
