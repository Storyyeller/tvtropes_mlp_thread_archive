<p></p>Although he was a pretty big idiot.  The creature practically flat out tells him it's going after his fiance,  but he still thinks it's after him and leaves her unguarded.  Protagonists in Victorian horror novels were rock stupid.  The guys in Dracula were similarly useless.

            The common image of Frankenstein's creature is generally pretty far off.  For one thing,  he was actually pretty intelligent and well spoken,  as well as strong,  unlike the zombielike shambling and moaning from a lot of adaptations.  Not to mention how many people call the creature Frankenstein.
