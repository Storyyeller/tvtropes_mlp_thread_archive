I am very sorry but that was a fixed point in time,  I can't change those.

<p></p>Okay surprise,  so you're gonna expect a single dude,  powerful as he may be,  to be responsible for your moral compass? You're gonna expect him to solve all your problems,  then?
<p></p>He's one dude,  who only even exists in the same <em>era</em> as you on occasion. Don't expect him to solve all your problems,  and certainly don't hold him responsible for <em>your</em> personal favours. He might not have been there to stop you,  but <em>you</em> pulled the trigger.

<p></p>Uhh,  ya know,  Surprise is a big girl and can look out for herself,  but this post just blows my mind.
<p></p>She's pissed because she tried to stop an alien invasion and <em>didn't know how</em> and did what any reasonable adult would do—saught an expert.  An expert who,  from her perspective,  never showed (she apparently doesn't know Scarf Dude IS Doctor Pony).  And now same Doctor is accusing her of "kidnapping" humans,  which as she's established before is a point-blank falsehood.
<p></p>By your reasoning,  if I ask an auto mechanic to fix my car and he never does and never explains why,  its my fault for expecting him to beat Battletoads for me.

<p></p>Just popping in to say Lyra is a cute pony.
<p></p>Lyra,  I've always been told that the... erm,  world is divided into two... dimensions?  layers?  halves?  One is Humania and the other is Ponia (where both Equestria and Dream Valley reside).  As far as I know,  all the humans who ever lived in Ponia were exports from Humania.
<p></p>I've never seen any history that contradicts this,  but then,  Surprise is always telling me that just because its never been contradicted doesn't mean its true,  so if you keep looking you may find evidence yet.

            And the first part is a completely reasonable issue. But when she brings it up in <em>response</em> to that accusation it's not "I blame him for not fixing my car because he wouldn't beat battletoads for me" it's "I can't beat battletoads because he won't fix my car."
<p></p>Sounded to me like she was blaming <em>her</em> business - which willful or not I still don't approve of the notion of - on the fact that he didn't show up.
<p></p>That said,  maybe we don't debate the moral dos and don'ts of fictional ponies based on fanfiction? I kinda don't feel like getting legitimately offended by fictional antics tonight.

            @Surprise,  or Raydence,  I guess: Yep,  I'm familiar with that.  Pity most ponies tend to treat it like modern humans think of El Dorado or whatever.

<p></p>Fair enough re: not wanting to think too much about fictional characters,  but this is the part that blew my mind.  Because she's not saying "I kidnap humans <strong>because</strong> he didn't show up."  At all.  Like,  I'm not even sure how you arrived at that.
<p></p>But,  well,  Doctor and Surprise don't seem too messed up about it,  so whatever.

            To explain why I brought this up,  watching FIM on a TV is awesome. I can say this for sure,  since a) two weeks back a friend of mine hooked his laptop up to his TV and put on Hurricane Fluttershy,  and b) I just watched the first two episodes from DVD.
<p></p>I've discovered that my current avatar makes me use the word 'awesome' a lot. This is,  of course,  awesome.
<p></p>On another note,  does anyone have a standard lie they use to explain away buying pony material? I ask this because getting said DVD's (plus one for <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneratorRex" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneratorRex">Generator Rex</a>) involved inventing a sister who'd had triplets. (I don't <em>think</em> I did the Liarjack face,  but I can't say for sure.)
