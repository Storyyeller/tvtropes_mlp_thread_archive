            @Ace:
<p></p>1. Twilight
<p></p>2. Twilight: I'm still a student,  and tend to read (or go on the internet) when I should probably be seeking real interaction.  But mostly because I get stressed out <em>really</em> easily.  You know Twilight's freakout in Lesson Zero?  I've been like that for like 6 years now.  And I suck at every sport except for ultimate frisbee and badminton.
<p></p>3.  Kinda.  Most of the relevant issues I was already aware of.

            Who's your favorite of the mane six?
<ul><li> Fluttershy.  She is the cutest pony and yet has some hidden courage that only surfaces on occasion.  Plus she'd a black sheep in that she's a pegasus who has a connection with the earth,  and I can relate to having grown up feeling like I'm different than everyone else.
</li></ul><p></p>What's your favorite episode?
<ul><li> Has to be "Sonic Rainboom".  Didn't present Dash as too much of a jerk,  the climax was the most uplifting in the series so far.
</li></ul><p></p>What do you think of Pinkie Pie?
<ul><li> Pinkie is enjoyable to watch because she's completely spontaneous,  but that doesn't provide a lot of opportunity to give her a solid episode starring her,  like Twilight or Rarity.  Only on occasions do I find her annoying.  I bet she'd be annoying in real life.
</li></ul><p></p>Favorite non-mane six character?
<ul><li> Spike.  Being a younger male among a cast of older women giving you full-on attention doesn't sound like a bad job.
</li></ul>

            @Ace: Maybe you can add which of the Mane 6 you admire the most,  and which you would most want to emulate? I realize that with their oft-immature characterizations they're not exactly the best target to reach but it's something like how I'd love to have AJ's patience or something.

            Let's see here...
<p></p><ul><li><strong>Favorite Mane Six Pony:</strong> Very hard to say,  but I think Rarity.  It's <em>close</em>,  though.
</li><li><strong>Favorite Episode:</strong> As things are shaping up now... probably "Suited For Success".
</li><li><strong>Opinion of Pinkie:</strong> She's probably my least favorite of the six,  but again,  it's very close.  I suppose it's just that I haven't read any good fics that really feature her - though <em>It Takes A Village</em> made me like her a lot.
</li><li><strong>Favorite Non-Main Six Character:</strong> Spike,  though my favorite background pony is Lyra.  She's adorable.
</li><li><strong>Would I Hug Trixie?:</strong> Yes,  if she would let me (which she wouldn't).  I feel like she needs some actual appreciation as a person,  not just as a performer.
<p></p></li><li><strong>Which of the Main Six is most relatable?:</strong> Probably... damn,  that's a hard one.  Probably Twilight; I know what it's like to feel overworked,  and even I have my minor spots of OCD.
</li><li><strong>Which traits do you see reflected?:</strong> Hm.  I'm very chill about work and deadlines,  but I have a very low tolerance for stress if people start reminding me constantly that I should be stressed about something.  Basically - I'll bend right up until I hit a certain point,  but after that point,  I <em>snap</em>.
</li><li><strong>Have I learnt to handle my own weaknesses better?:</strong> If I have,  I haven't noticed it - and if I've noticed it,  I haven't attributed it to the show.
</li></ul>

Stubborn do-it-myself-mode Applejack.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">What traits of yourself do up you see reflected in the Mane 6 in general?</div>
Applejack's [see above],  Rarity's attention to detail,  Fluttershy's panic response,  Rainbow Dash's "can't let anyone know I'm panicking" response,  Twilight's bibliophile-ness,  and occasionally Pinkie's randomness.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Have you learnt to handle your own weaknesses better thanks to the Mane 6?</div>
To be honest,  no. Experience still proves to be the better teacher,  in my case.

            ^^Not really. I had that idea in part because it was the only episode I could think of that was just a bit out there (even for this show) and that was never alluded to before or after.

            <ul><li>Favorite Mane Six Pony: I don't really know. As of now it's Pinkie but Fluttershy is close. Sometimes Rainbow Dash is up there as well.
</li><li>Favorite Episode: My very favorite episode is "Sonic Rainboom". It showed us the personality traits of Rainbow Dash quite well. I consider it far superior in character than both of the new episodes.
</li><li>Opinion of Pinkie: I quite like her. Yes she is an obnoxious twit but she is also quite funny. Her breakdowns are the most fun and she knows how to have a fun time,  which is what life is about. Though I wouldn't be able to stand her long in real life.
</li><li>Favorite Non-Main Six Character: Luna,  there is simply something about both her aura of command and her adorableness that appeals to me. She is my Second favorite pony of all time! Not sure about the background ponies.
</li><li>Would I Hug Trixie?: I would if she is in desperate need for attention and love. However she wouldn't want to hug me anyways.
</li><li>Which of the Main Six is most relatable?: I would say the Pinkie Pie's love of life and hedonism and Twilight Sparkle's inclusiveness would do well with me. I hope that I can be of use as an emotional healer like Fluttershy too.
</li><li>Which traits do you see reflected?: Well for me. Me and Pinkie deal with both of our problems the same way,  via locking themselves in our rooms and talking to themselves. Though with her she actually role plays with objects,  I simply rock back and forth as I mutter internally and sometimes externally. Twilight Sparkle reflects me in the way of my own interests. I consider myself a person of versatile tastes and Twilight Sparkle is <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMario" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMario">The Mario</a> of magics. That and Twilight Sparkle is a reclusive person and I would imagine quite kinky as well. (Don't look at me like that).
</li><li>Have I learnt to handle my own weaknesses better?: Not really.

            Funny,  I'd think a distorted Twilight Sparkle would be rather kinky,  but it's hard to imagine the canon version having any sort of sexual desires.
