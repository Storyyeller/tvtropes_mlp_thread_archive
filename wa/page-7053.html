            This seems like more of a lesson for RBD,  but maybe a lesson for AJ to learn could be "slow and steady wins the race; don't do things as quick as you can".
<p></p>...I'm horrible at coming up with lessons for AJ,  since it seems she knows most everything.

Not to mention the "she's evil" thing was also a bit of a stretch.

            @Zah: She jumped that gun,  yeah,  but Cadence was also acting quite out of character as compared to Twi's memories of her. And then she didn't articulate her suspicions quite enough and since she never talked about it,  the other Mane Six didn't understand that Chrys!Cadence was not who she was thought to be and accepted the handwaving of bridezillaness.
<p></p>Yes Twilight,  if you had talked to the others about your bro and the best foalsitter in all of Canterlot this never would have happened.

            So clear communication would have accelerated the plan-thwarting?
<p></p>Or would it have made things worse? We don't know if the Elements of Harmony would have stopped Queen Chrysalis,  and they wouldn't have found the real Cadence in the underground caves.
