            @Enlong
Yeah,  if anything,  it was more about Rainbow Dash being on guard the entire time rather than Twilight possibly losing it.
<p></p>I did like hearing Coach Shining Armor. His normal voice sounds a little too casual but his coach voice really did affirm why he is the Captain of the Royal Guard.

            Well,  given his captain of the guard position,  he's probably the best suited for physical training.

            @Crow: My guess is that given all the assistants he and Cadance have,  his current job is less intensive than his previous one. That and if he's the pony equivalent of a marine or Green Beret or whatever,  he's obviously a good athlete.

<p></p>Okay then. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">Cadence was sent away from the Crystal Kingdom shortly after Sombra assassinated the previous queen and seized power. She grew up in the kingdom led by the princesses who took out Sombra. When she was fully grown,  Celestia saw an opportunity to bring the empire back,  and re-instate its rightful queen.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">

            RE: Shiny doing training: He's probably not the best in the world at the job,  but one imagines he was probably a drill seargent at one point in his career,  to judge from his bellows.
<p></p>...how old IS he,  anyways? He can't be older than his late-20's,  and he's already captain of the guard? I wonder if there's any noble benefits going on there?

            Actually,  I didn't think of it before,  but I wonder what happened to Shining's captain of the guard post.  I assumed he kept it when he married Cadance,  but now that they're living in the Crystal Empire,  he must have had to resign,  right?  So he's probably got too much time on his hands lately.

            Don't think she's actually derecitly related to the Crystal Empires rulers. All the actual Crystal ponies keep their crystalness. But non CP's only get it for a short while after getting blasted by the heart. So she's not a Crystal Pony.

            I think it's a species thing. She's not a Crystal Pony,  same as she isn't technically a Unicorn,  Pegasus,  or Earth Pony. She's an Alicorn,  which means she's born for royalty,  in this sort of world.
