            @Blue You're confusing "something happened that should have made them famous" with "they are shown to be famous". While the fact that they're <em>not</em> overly famous is kinda strange,  they are never actually shown to <em>be</em> famous after the events. <em>That</em> is consistent.

            @Blue Most of which were local to Ponyville,  and nowhere else. Your average "hometown hero",  so to speak,  is almost never known outside of said hometown. As for Rarity,  she <em>was</em> seen socializing with Fancypants at the wedding reception,  so those social connections still exist.

            @Mio It's his sueness. At least for his introduction (after that he's just been groan worthy)
<p></p>Oh no,  his mane wasn't yellow,  it was <em>vibrant</em> gold. His eyes too looked like pools of liquid gold. He,  as a teenager,  somehow knew more about Zebra culture than both of the Princesses and was the ONLY one who realized that what they were doing was going to lead to war,  but no one listened to him because he was too young and speaking out of turn. He's then beaten visciously by Blueblood but stoically ignores it,  and stares at the royal guards with enough confidence to intimidate them. And the very utterance of his name was apparently important enough to end a chapter on

            @Mio It's annoying because Somber IS a good storyteller (at least by my standards) He just seems to be in love with this one character. If I KNEW he was a villain then I MIGHT be able to accept it,  and apparently,  recent events have shown him making mistakes.
<p></p>but I've honestly god this nagging feeling that this guy is gonna turn out to be an Anti-Hero of some kind.
