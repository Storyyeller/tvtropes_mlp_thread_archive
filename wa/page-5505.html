            <em>Who word of god confirmed was not only 50 some times removed,  but even that connection was via adoption</em>
<p></p>Whoah,  when was this said anywhere? Is it legitimately Blueblood was adopted,  or Celestia 'adopted' a family somewhere down the line and things just sort of degraded from there? (Following the canon of <em>The Colour You Bleed</em>,  Celestia and Luna had originally been descendants of Princess Platinum before they became old souls,  so the Star family was <em>technically</em> related to them,  even though at the point one becomes an old soul you can't really be said to be related to anyone but the other old souls)

            @Mousa That was a joke.
<p></p>But seriously they're robots from Battlestar Galactica and the voice actress for EDI was in the remake.
<p></p>Yeah Faust said Blueblood was distantly related from Celestia's mother's side.

            pretty sure at some later point one of the show runners commented that Blue Bloods ancestor was adopted.
<p></p>Of course my Head cannon is that he's the descendent of the old unicorn royalty and the title comes from that,  but since almost no one except the upper aristocracy even remebers there was a unicorn royal line,  most ponies just assume that if he's a "prince" he must be realted to the Princesses and so figure he's some distant nephew.

            @Mousa The 14: That reminds me <em>way</em> too much of my own dream where during the wedding,  a small dragon army swoops in to attack Canterlot to take back Spike to their homeland. And it during it,  it seemed that a blue dragoness was awfully targeting Spike (as in I believe she was his mom).
<p></p>That,  and then Princess Cadence turns out to be a villain,  just as Canterlot is attacked by the swarming dragons. Then,  a robotic army descends upon the city,  and very shortly afterwards,  lava-like demons start wrecking the place.
<p></p>Long story short,  Spike (and of the Mane Six) get kidnapped,  four main villain factors are revealed (Dragons,  Cadence,  Robots,  Lava-Demons),  and half of Canterlot is wrecked.

<p></p>No,  she's really three ponies,  inside a dragon costume,  disguised as an Alicorn. And the 3 ponies are the CMC. Celestia knows about the disguise but thinks she's secretly a dragon.
