After a short lid flipping,  Mando calmed down and apologized for being overly emotional while thanking everyone for their support,  while many from /mlp/ came to apologize for the behavior displayed by their peers. At least,  that's what I saw on the comments to his latest video,  which I have followed for a while now.

            @Kyler: Yeah,  I've seen plenty of that. From what I've gotten some people thought she should have been more hesitant and should have reached the conclusion on her own. Others think her apology wasn't sincere enough. Still others think she needed to be punished,  or that the CMC should have gone through with the prank anyway because that is the way you deal with a bully.

            Eh.  My problem with it is just that from a writing perspective the moral and resolution hinge on how Babs's bullying was unusual for her.  It makes for a good moral about how asshole breeds asshole among "normal" people,  but shies away from how to deal with Asshole Zero.  It irritates me more than it would on its own,  because it's already a thing for cartoons to barely (if at all) acknowledge that sometimes bullies <em>don't</em> have that kind of sympathetic bent and really are just dicks because they think it's funny.
<p></p>Like,  yeah,  reach out to people as a first resort,  and be ready for people to be complex human beings with flaws and insecurities — but you need to be mentally prepared for some people to just be slime.

            Given that Asshole Zero is Diamond Tiara in this case,  the episode seemed to be pretty clear on what to do,  namely tell other people about it and stand up to them without stooping to their level.

            @Pykrete: It might just be me,  but that sounds less like a problem with the actual episode's writing and more "I'd rather have had them do this lesson than the one they actually did".  No,  they didn't address how to deal with "Asshole Zero",  but that wasn't really the point of the episode.

            @Pykrete That doesn't change the fact that the show did acknowledge that some bullies are just like that. And what Babs did to the CMC was actual physical harassment and theft,  not thug intimidation. They weren't so much afraid of her as they were of being snitches.

I seriously doubt that it's going to end DT and SS's bullying.  I got the idea they just put it in so DATASS wouldn't get off scot-free.  It was a temporary solution at best.

            @Applelight: Seems that way.
<p></p>Four episodes in and it seems we already have something to eclipse MMDW in terms of pure controversy,  which should have been expected considering the subject matter.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Well,  one could say that the only reason Babs exist is so they could have a really cruel bully and maintain the status quo at the same time. Unfortunate,  but ultimately expected.

            I know.  Like I said,  it bugs me more than it otherwise would because cartoons on the whole like to dance around that issue.  I mean,  "bully is really an insecure victim and just needs some hugs" is pretty stock,  but few of them have the stones to admit kids being jerks for shits and giggles is even a thing (and FIM is already the exception to the rule that way).  Which is weird,  because the same cartoons typically have no such compunctions about older characters doing so.
<p></p>Also,  I'm not sure whether to laugh or o_0 about Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon being referred to as DATASS.

            @JT And their bullying thus far as been so soft that they don't warrant much more than that. They're just a nuisance to the CMC,  especially compared to what Babs did.
