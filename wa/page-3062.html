            ^She didn't want to bend and admit that she'd lost after being built up (and building herself up,  as well) as a shoo-in for the blue ribbon.  She was embarrassed,  so she pretended it was just a thing she'd decided to do on a whim after winning.
<p></p>Also,  in regards to 'AJ and Dash embody each others' Elements' - they all have elements of each other,  some just more visible than others.  Pinkie can be kind,  and she's usually honest (unless it relates to corn cakes); Rarity is loyal to her friends,  and Dash is honest.  It's just that Honesty is Dash's second-greatest trait (of the blunt sort),  and Loyalty is Applejack's.

            Yeah,  I'm thinking that AJ was planning to come back once she earned the money that she promised the mayor.  Also,  somebody made the point that the reason AJ is so bent on making the money is because she said she would bring it back,  and she'd feel like a liar if she didn't manage it.

            Setting a date for her return - especially a long time,  like a month - would have drawn questions about how she was so specific (because she knows how much the Mayor wanted and presumably negotiated her wages),  and the whole thing would have come crashing down.

            Still,  I think adding an assurance of her eventual return would've made her vague reasons for staying with Jubilee much more palletable to the rest of the mane cast. As things stood,  they honestly didn't think she was EVER coming back. Hence why they were so desperate to know why

            In short,  both the girls and AJ had reasons to act the way they did,  and I can't fault them for it - the girls were overreacting because they lacked information that Applejack wasn't giving them because she was ashamed of what she saw as an inexcusable failure.
<p></p>^Again,  though,  saying 'I'll be back in a month' would raise questions of A) why she would stay away that long on a whim and B) why such a specific time frame for return,  both of which would eventually force Applejack to reveal her loss.

            @Red She wouldn't have needed to be specific with the time she gave.
<p></p>We don't know if the cast would've reacted with as much desperation had they known that AJ would've be returning at some point. There's a difference between "Why are you leaving for a month?" and "Why are you leaving FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?" the mane cast were acting under assumptions that she'd be leaving for good.
<p></p>AJ could've just told them that she needed a change of scenery and that it would do her some good,  they would've asked "how long will you be?" She then could've given a still vague but more precise time "say a month or so" and that would've been that. The desperate need to know is gone because they know that she'll be returning at some point.
<p></p>do I speak illogically?
