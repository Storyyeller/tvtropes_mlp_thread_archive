            @crow Eh,  I don't want to just accept things and not think about them. I need to start finding flaws in things.
<p></p>@ginger I don't really remember her from the show,  but she got <em>way</em> too OP in the movie. That last fight scene was utterly ridiculous.

            Oh yeah,  Book. I really liked him. He was cool.
<p></p>But I like being critical of things sometimes. If you can pick out problems in things it makes you feel smart,  and then when you view something that doesn't have these problems,  and it <em>works</em>,  you can recognize why it works and you appreciate it and enjoy it more.

            Well,  Orion doesn't have a canon name,  so yeah,  it still holds. You could call him Starry Night in a fic if you wanted,  and no one would really care. Of course,  we have a sockpuppet here,  so that changes things a bit,  but he isn't exactly equivalent with a canon character.

            Yeah,  River did get a little ridiculous in the movie.  In the series she had exactly one badass moment,  which consisted of taking out three mooks.
<p></p>Red guy is Thanos.  He was involved with the Infinity Gauntlet (I think that's what it was called) which had a brief cameo in Asgard's vault back in Thor.

            I'm just not a fan of the "unstoppable yet traumatized super soldier" type of character. because they're rarely ever given a wothy opponent,  and the conflict is based around KEEPING them from kicking ass or the character learning to cope with the power,  or learning to activate it at will,  or convincing themselves to get over their issues and fight.
<p></p>This is all well and good,  but I'm also supposed to find he action scenes enjoyable,  right? I've said it once,  I've said it a thousand times "main chaacters curb-stomping people does not interest me" It might work from an emotional standpoint,  but as a spectacle that I''m supposed to enjoy I just find it tooth grindingly annoying

            Well a lot of people do enjoy seeing characters do awesome stuff,  and they aren't making movies for you specifically.
<p></p>Red guy has not yet appeared in any of the Marvel movies.  Avengers was his first appearance.

            He hasn't been in any movies yet.

            Ah,  ok. I'm not super big on comic books,  so my knowledge is rudimentary at best.
<p></p>Also,  I can't stand curb-stomp battles,  unless the one being curb-stomped really deserved it. Arrogant villains are my least favorite types,  because their smugness makes me want to punch their face in. Can't think of any other pet peeve tropes right now,  but what are some of yours?

            I have a surprisingly large comic book knowledge base,  though it comes entirely from cartoons,  browsing this wiki,  and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtopTheFourthWall" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtopTheFourthWall">Atop the Fourth Wall</a>. I've never actually read a physical comic book outside of a few manga a friend gave me a long time ago.

<p></p>You asked why the Derpy toy made you suspicious rather than happy,  and the easy answer is cynicism. <em>Most</em> people are cynical when it comes to companies and their motives,  so it's not just you. Sorry if I offended you.

            @Calnos It's a long time until ponies,  so I guess we're just discussing whatever comes to mind.
<p></p>And yes,  Purple,  that question was for everyone.
<p></p>@ginger That bothers me a bit too. If the hero has to walk through the Valley of Doom or whatnot,  he'd better end up getting some doom.
<p></p>Of course,  there are some moments that are just so awesome that I can deal with them. Hulk punching Alfred (the whale thing),  I was on the fence about. He seems really OP,  but it was just so cool.
