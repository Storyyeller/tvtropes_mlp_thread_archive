            The Sapphire cupcake that the Cakes made for Spike.
<p></p>I wonder if the recipe was actually made FOR dragons. You know,  like they were looking through an old stack of cookbooks one day and found a list of meals that you can prepare for other species. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            No,  if the gem's innate frequency matches the tuning fork's then you should feel it vibrate. If the gem is pure and wholesome then the whole gem should resonate to a single wavelength.
<p></p>...I don't know. I'm still googling it if this makes sense in real life. I'm pretty sure Spike is just doing that because it makes a nice sight gag,  but still...

On the other hand it's sparked a scientific curiousity in me since I know that there should be a research somewhere about the correlation between a material's qualities (don't know what yet) and its innate acoustic resonance.
<p></p>By the way,  Spike uses the C4 tuning fork for that gag.

            Bah! MY watsonian hat will not be denied! And aging a gem could just be making sure it's pure. A lot of gems are made from compressed rock,  after all - nobody wants coal in the middle of their diamond. And since Amethyst is an impurity of quartz,  you wouldn't want ot mix tastes there,  maybe.

            This episode gets kinda weird when you realize that Celestia probably knew all about Dragon puberty when she decided to let Twilight keep Spike.
<p></p>You'd think she would've mentioned this to either of them at some point. You know,  it'd put less lives at risk for one <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            Yeah,  like Spike's NEXT birthday.
<p></p>Alternativly,  Celestia knew Spike would never go into hoard mode from his birthday presents beacuse Twilight always gets him books.

            All right,  let me try to reply to THIRTY PAGES IN ONE DAY SHEESH:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Remember most of us predicted it would be Fat! Spike? Kinda glad that didn't happen.....grown up Spike was much more awesome looking. </div>
I think our "parade balloon" guess would have been better.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Synopsis: Apple Bloom doesn't want Granny Smith to embarrass her by speaking in her class. </div>
This might be the reason Granny Smith has gotten so many appearances this season,  so that regular viewers will already be more aware of how she speaks and how she could be embarrassing.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Note that Rainbow Dash can identify Fluttershy and Pinkie based only on their screams. Interesting. </div>
I don't know how she does it!  They have the same voice!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> I'm more concerned with Twilight's ability to teleport somepony else. That's pretty cool. </div>
Well,  before she was able to teleport <em>with</em> Spike...  So what is the deal with Twilight Sparkle only using teleportation for the most frivolous things?
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Yeah,  she teleported Pinkie in from someplace,  but it's Pinkie... </div>
Oh,  right,  Pinkie Pie would always use her dark powers to mess up the teleporter somehow.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Alarm speakers,  overhead lamps,  and stethescopes?
<p></p>I give up. </div>
But Twilight still uses candlelight!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Double thinking,  yeah I am a little annoyed by AJ's uselessness,  but at least she was JUST useless,  unlike Pinkie,  who was actively DETRIMENTAL to the issue at hand </div>
Pinkie Pie should have learned from Fluttershy in "Swarm of the Century" that appeasement isn't the answer!  ...Wait,  wasn't Pinkie teaching the lesson of that episode?  I don't know anymore!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> For the meme count; Doctor Obvious "I see the problem,  he's a dragon." </div>
Yeah,  great way to state the problem.  Now wait,  was he just making a generalization about dragons being like that,  or was he under the impression that Spike was a pony that turned into a dragon as some kind of disease?  I was reminded of when Daffidazey blamed her hairdressing foul-up on forgetting that Spike wasn't a pony.
<p></p>Of course the "Fire Ruby" also reminded me of the Heart Stone from "Crunch the Rockdog".  Always gotta make the "Have a heart" message as literal as possible,  eh?
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Apparently gems can be grown. </div>
Oh... I thought Spike might have been <em>cutting</em> the ruby.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Big shocker: Maybe there are different types of Dragons? surprised
<p></p>There are other types of ponies after all <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16"> </div>
That was their guess in "Spike's Search". <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Also,  does this mean that non-greedy dragons don't grow up at all? That would be a good explanation to Rarity/Spike shipping: He is a baby dragon,  but in dragon terms,  this only means "a nice,  innocent,  generous dragon",  not necessarily immaturity. </div>
Aw,  then G3 Spike really was a nice guy.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> wild mass guess Without Unicorns,  dragons hatch eggs by piling treasure around them and this triggers the hatching. wild mass guess </div>
So what Twilight really needed to do at the exam was conjure up a big pile of gems...
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> I'm usually hesitant to assign to much significance to background pony placement since it's probably pretty random most of the time,  but since it was a Derpy scene does this mean the animators are acknowledging Lyra x Bon Bon? </div>
I took it as the animators making fun of it: They show you the pair together,  then Derpy appears as if to say "You think this means something,  don't you?"
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> June Bug.
<p></p>I can definitely love her as a background pony. And this is the first episode where she gets some lines! I do remember her name used before... </div>
<a class="urllink" href="http://mylittlewiki.org/wiki/Junebug">Is this the original Junebug?<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Also,  Lickety Split is the second pony to have a male-looking head as well as only-visible-when-eyes-aren't-open eyelashes; the first was that pony who got a bowling Cutie Mark in "The Cutie Pox". Are ponies like these supposed to be male or female? </div>
Maybe they're supposed to be like the new,  slightly-more-feminine-looking boy pony toys from the blind bag line?  (But just watch and see them release a G4 Lickety-Split toy that looks nothing like him.)
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> What if...what if Minty was gender flipped? surprised </div>
I think a better gag would be to hire Nancy Cartwright to voice the new Minty.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> I coooouuuuuuuuld be pedantic tongue and argue that the inkwell was wrapped inside the parchment and MAY have been teleported along with it that way,  and that therefore the "only parchment can be teleported" Theory is still valid,  but I won't. </div>
Awww,  but that would be a funny way to explain the commercial where Princess Celestia came wrapped up in a scroll!  "Yes,  I can handle being cremated alive,  what of it?"

            Trying to find simple correlation model between chemical structure and natural frequency has yielded hilarious gems such as crystal therapy.
<p></p>Anyway,  in that scene Spike clearly expects the gem resonating with the tuning fork to be evidence of its pureness. Pretty sure gems aren't supposed to have that low of a natural frequency,  but oh well.
