<p></p>RD- Aerobatics show
<p></p>AJ- Some of her Rodeo Pony routines.
<p></p>Twilight - EXTREME Studying,  or her super OCD organinzation ability (it would never come to her to use just magic for h show)
<p></p>Pinkie - Epic baking
<p></p>Rarity - Dressmaking on the fly skills
<p></p>Fluttershy - (after the needed hurdles to actually get her to go on) singing. nt the best on a technical level but is just so cute none of the judges can vote her off.

            Yeah Trixie would be hilarious as a judge,  but ALL she'd do is be mean and negative,  you need someone that can also be postive about the good stuff. Plus having her host would be SO entertaining,  that way she can but in all sorts of snide little jabs everytime she intoduces a new act.....
<p></p>Oh maybe have her constantly make under her breathe comments about how beter a job she'd do as a judge.

            @Seraph The thing is,  the judges are a MASSIVE part of the show,  yet the only one who looks like she could make any kind of criticism is Sapphire. I just think it'd be better to have a Simon analogue in there,  otherwise the judging sections would lose a lot of their imapact.

Fancypants is the one that tries to find the best out of every performance while advising them how to improve the less then great parts. Soarin is in the middle really laid back about it,  infuriating the other two judges because he'll just give some quick eh,  meh,  okay comments without really saying much.just if he liked or didn't lie it.
<p></p>And Trixie constantly heckling them from on stage.

            Is the host even all that much of a presence on these shows?  Granted I don't watch them very often,  but it seems like they try to be relatively unobtrusive and supportive of all the performers,  which Trixie would not be good at.  Fancy Pants just seems a much better choice for host,  hes friendly and charming,  which is what the host needs.

            so we'd have Soarin loving everything pretty much,  except ones that are just BAD,  even then he's nice about it.
<p></p>Saphire being tough but fair and brutally honest
<p></p>and trixie hating everything,  but it's the degree of hatred that matters,  the better ones get more of it. With the other judges calling her out on it with the best perfromaces till she just gives in and admits it wasn't completely horrid.

            Yeah,  but what would the other acts be.
<p></p>I still think Snips and Snails should go up there and retry their magic act. Just to see trixie burst out laughing halfway through
<p></p>actually,  we have all the mane act types covered by the three judges.
<p></p>Physical feats - Soarin' <br>
Dancing and Singing - Sapphire <br>
Magic and showmanship - Trixie

            Well the acts shouldn't all be from mane and secondary cast members.  We'd have to draw in some background ponies,  and possibly some <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs">O Cs</a> if we're going to other towns.

            then the final,  Cadance would be the extra nice one,  Tia the though but fair,  and Luna ould wtill be nice overall,  but be the one that pays way to much attention to the tiny little details becuase she gets WAY to into the whole "judge" thing,  actaully keeps a points record and takes off some for little things,  like -5 for every note that was even a bit off,  or a lose thread on there outfit,  tiny things that nopony else even noticed. not to be mean,  but just becuase she got to into the "judging" aspect.
