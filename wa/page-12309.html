            Yeah,  I really wish DT and SS had been incorporated more.  Like maybe show them pressuring Babs into being more mean to the CMC that she would have been otherwise.
<p></p>@Patty: Yeah,  I can see where you're coming from.
<p></p>Also,  I think the Babs Seed song is probably the most easy to get stuck in your head song from the entire show so far.  Not the best song,  but definitely one of the catchiest.

            Say,  I had an interesting notion while I was out: What if the moral of the episode <em>wasn't</em> intended to be actually about talking to an adult about bullying or about bullies being afraid themselves,  but rather a <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeNeverWorks" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeNeverWorks">Revenge Never Works</a> type plot? I mean,  not exactly,  but a way one could take the moral is that <em>anyone</em> can wind up being a bully,  even someone who was bullied themselves,  if they aren't careful about it.
<p></p>Of course it's possible that <em>was</em> them oral everyone else got and I was just slow about it...

            I think it really covers both.  The episode obviously has a huge note of "if you're bullied,  the worst thing to do is bully someone else".  It wouldn't be the first time the show had an obvious secondary moral that doesn't get explicitly stated.

            Have we seen Rarity's parents house or Sweetie Belle's room before?
<p></p>Also the phrase "scoot your boot" was used. This amused me.

<p></p>I thought of the OOTS version when seeing the episode,  but I've never seen the original.

            Eh,  Scoots didn't really <em>fly</em>,  she hovered for a little bit. I doubt she could sustain it much longer than she did. After all,  she managed to stay up for a <em>little</em> bit in Ponyville Confidential before dropping.
