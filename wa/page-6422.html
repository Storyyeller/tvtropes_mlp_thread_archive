            @Ginger But you <em>can't possibly know whether or not the spoiler is something you will care about</em>. If there is <em>any</em> risk of something being ruined like that,  then you can't look at <em>any</em> spoilers.

            @Seraph: Yeah,  you're probably right. I'm just in a really foul mood lately,  so I'm probably looking on it less favorably. Still,  I stand by it. I'll stick with my blog,  my writing,  and you guys. I don't have much inclination to interact with the rest of the community,  aside from the art it produces. Like I said: It's a very good fandom for producers.
<p></p>I guess a part of it is the lack of experience,  too. I mean,  I always hear it said how great and calm and peaceful a fandom it is,  and having never seen anything else all I can do is look at it and think... <em>this</em> is good? Not terrible,  sure,  but really worth lauding?

            Azula's breakdown was being built up to for a large part of the third season,  it isn't like she just decided to flip out in the last episode to give Zuko a fighting chance.  It was really a culmination of the way she treats the people around her,  and didn't you say you like a villain's downfall to be a result of some flaw of theirs?

            I'm just not a fan of Villainous Breakdowns in general... well I am. It depends on how it's done. If it happens during the final fight when the villain's fate is in it's death throes then it can make for an entertaining final few moments. But when the breakdown is prolonged,  it just makes the villain look pathetic
<p></p>Of course if I HATE the villain in question (right,  Light Yagami) Then I also love it <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            @Ginger Then I don't know what to tell you. You can't get spoiled because it might ruin it,  but <em>not</em> getting spoiled is equally likely to ruin it. Combine that with your very narrow tastes and I'm surprised you can get through anything and still  enjoy it,  because there are so very few things that you'll even touch in the first place,  and your spoiler weirdness makes <em>everything</em> a 50/50 crapshoot,  regardless of how it lives up to your standards otherwise.

            Honestly? About the only real thing that FiM's fanbase has over most others is that we can make a case for it being almost accidental,  in a sense; had it not been for that one guy writing an article about how this show is evil (on my <em>birthday</em>,  no less),  4chan would've probably paid the show no more mind than they give any other cartoon with decent writing,  and the fandom as a whole would've probably been a lot smaller than it is now. Yeah,  I know "love and tolerance" has been corrupted into a bastardization of what it used to mean because of some less-than-desireable people over time,  but I still follow it by what it used to mean because I happen to be rather good at ignoring haters/trolls and just generally not giving a fuck what others think of my interests. I like the show already because it's well-done and hilarious,  but I <em>love</em> it even more <em> <strong>because</strong> </em> of the fanbase,  no matter how crazy they can get at times,  simply due to the sheer amount of amazing material that continues to pour out at an astonishing rate.

            @ Kegi and there's the issue lack of context,  your thinking that it isn't as good as people say it is while looking at it in a vacuum of what you personally consider "good",  when they mean as compared to other's of it's type it's better.
<p></p>Like how we say MMDW is a bad episode,  but anyone who watches only it could look at it and go "This is bad?" Because we mean "bad compared to other episodes" not "bad in and of itself" same thing,  the ratio of good to bad is much much higher in this fandom then most others of it's type,  yes the bad still exists,  but it is far outweighed by the good.

            @Lurker Well,  to be honest,  not being aware of spoilers has only ruined Madoka for me so far,  ordinarily I just get by not knowing anything.
<p></p>What I can't stand are the people who go to insane lengths to obnoxiously keep spoilers from me. Behaviour like that is what makes me dislike spoilers. Especially when they start fucking with me.

            What L Mage said. Way back when,  I quit because I thought I wasn't enjoying it. I came back around the middle of the Earth Episodes and really started liking it. Partially because it just gets more interesting later,  partially because of Toph,  and even though I hate her,  partially because of Azula,  too. Not because of her solely,  but because of Mai and Ty Lee. <br> <br>Besides,  you haven't been hating it so far,  you should just keep going unless you absolutely can't stand it. <br> <br>Super delay,  probably repeating,  but whatever. <br> <br>Also,  I personally sort of agree with kegi,  but it's not that bad if you just kind of ignore the stupid. I'm kind of used to it from other fandoms I've been in/am in. <br> <br><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_down.png" alt="[down]" title="[down]" height="16" width="16"><span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> Ginger's saying some stuff that doesn't make much sense without explanation</div></span>
