            no one is saying FOE couldn't use a pass or two through an editor. When we say it's that good we mean the whole overall story,  yes there are plenty of little things that could be altered THOSE are the things that are the result of it being a fanfic and yes would be fix'ed by an editor before it would be published.
<p></p>eh that came out bad. Ok there are certain flaws to it that ARE acceptable to fanfics,  but are not to a full published work,  and yes they would need to be fixed by aneditor before publishing,  but the overall story,  the big emotinal journey,  THAT is what is so amazing the little details can be fix'd easily.
<p></p>As to pople just not liking it,  eh YMMV. And Lil'pip isn't supposed to BE anything,  she's just what she is,  a normal pony trying to do what she thinks is right,  is she perfect,  buck no.

            It's not a <em>total</em> loss as long as it focuses on characterization or otherwise revealing something about the characters and setting.  It's when it exists solely to make the characters look awesome that you have a problem.
<p></p>As for gauging fanfic quality,  that's nearly impossible.  Especially since it can be a fine line as to whether you give credit to the author for how they utilize the characters and setting,  or the original work's author for how they created the characters and setting to begin with.  I think fanfic can be good,  but comparing it to an original work in terms of quality is almost impossible because they necessarily borrow a lot from the source material.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">To use FE as an example whether or not it's a good work,  I can't in good conscience say that it's a good work <em>solely on it's own merits</em> because it borrows so much from both the MLP and Fallout universes.  Fanfic <em>cannot</em> exist in a vacuum,  after all.  I think a lot of the issue is that people are going "this is as good as a published original work" when it's really impossible to compare the two.  Yes,  FE might be an awesome story,  but a <em>lot</em> of that awesomeness comes from the source material.  Comparing it to something that the author came up with on their own could look like you're devaluing the effort an author puts into an original work creating everything from scratch.

            Well,  in random non-pony related news I finished watching <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GundamSeed" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GundamSeed">Gundam SEED</a> just now. And honestly,  as bad/boring as it could get (and it could get pretty boring),  I thought it ended pretty decently. I would still rank it as my least favorite Gundam series (there are plenty of Gundam series I haven't watched so that may not mean much).

            <span class="blue">Ah,  Gundam Seed.  I still look back on it fondly for nostalgic reasons,  even though it's a pretty weak series.  Though I really think it actually had a lot of potential.  The plot is good,  the setting is good,  most of the characters are good.  It's only the execution of it all that's lacking.</span>

<p></p>Fanfic writers can and do revise earlier chapters. In fact,  for something minor and easily fixed like a typo,  I'd say it's inexcusable not to if someone points it out to you.

            @Bluespade: I'm with you on that.  I don't mind if the work itself is grimdark,  but I'm not a big fan of taking something that's original upbeat and pumping it full of dark elements.  That's why why I just couldn't muster the effort to finish FE.  It's not a <em>bad</em> story or badly written by any stretch,  but I'm simply not interested in reading that type of story.  I don't want to read a story about a war-ravaged Equestria because it's simply not the setting from the show.  I don't want a story where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rarity splits up her soul or where Pinkie Pie is a drug addict or where Fluttershy suffers a fate worse than death.</span>  It might very well be incredibly well written (and I think it is quite well written),  but it's telling a story that just doesn't interest me that much.  That and I just didn't connect with the OC's.  The only one I actually liked was Calamity,  and he didn't really get much screentime.
