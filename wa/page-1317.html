Yeah,  but that's more a parent-to-child thing in my mind.  In my experience,  siblings simply ignore each other.

Pretty much my story.  I saw a lot of references in tropes,  decided to study a bit more,  watched the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowYourMeme" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowYourMeme">Know Your Meme</a> video,  gave "Bridle Gossip" a try,  and the next thing I know I woke up in front of my computer with a dozen episodes from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTube" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTube">YouTube</a>,  a party hat on my nose,  and an urge to share the show with everyone else...

FTFY.  Everyone knows Twilight is the brains of the group.

            Everyone goes on about how amazing Rarity's voice is. While it IS amazing (all their voices are),  I just don't see what elevates it above all the others
<p></p>Maybe I'm just not good at analyzing voice actors

            I just love all of Rarity's little squeaks when she gets excited - I find them really cute,  for some reason. But yeah,  her ham factor goes through the roof as Luna.
<p></p>Oh man,  I just realized... all those pictures of Trixie becoming Luna's apprentice. Can you imagine those two in the same room? The entire place would smell of pork.

            So,  I actually had a bit of a strange experience last night.  My dream was set in a fictional country that had been struck by a freak amount of rain,  so there were floods and evacuations going on all over the place.  While I was traveling with my family,  we were attacked by this guy,  who I fought and eventually killed - but I noticed right as I stabbed him that he was wearing an Elements of Harmony shirt.  Somehow,  I feel really,  really bad about it - moreso,  I'm sure,  than if he were just some random dream fellow.

<p></p>Earth Ponies have a special connection to the land.  This leads me to believe that they are needed to grow plants properly.  And this means that they are in charge of food supply.
<p></p>Actually,  that's pretty important!
<p></p>So,  even though we see them growing crops in a manner similar to real life,  there's an unseen EP magic occuring that ensures the crops will be great?  Like how Pegasi move clouds?
<p></p>Afterall,  the Apploosans were able to grow a freakin orchard in the middle of a desert in no time at all.  That <em>has</em> to be magic assisted.

            On the subject of favorite cast members,  I kind of want to be the guy who actually places Rarity highly. See,  it's not something I would have thought when first seeing her character,  but over the course of the series,  I've noticed that she's just a really <em>good</em> person.
<p></p>And not just in Suited For Success,  though that is a very good example of how she'll do whatever it takes to help her friends,  even if it defies every artistic sensibility she has. There's also "Green Isn't Your Color",  where she realizes right off the bat how petty her jealousy towards Fluttershy's position is,  especially since she got her there by begging for her help in the first place. In another show with this kind of episode,  the person being jealous probably wouldn't be so self-aware until the end of the episode,  when it's time for them to learn their lesson. Rarity knows how petty she's being,  and even though she can't help feeling jealous,  she is determined to not let her feelings interfere with what she honestly thinks will make her friend happy.
<p></p>Or even "Sonic Rainboom". Yeah,  she went off the deep end,  but the only reason she got those dangerously fabulous wings in the first place was because she volunteered to basically be a guinea pig for a difficult spell that Twilight hadn't even <em>tried</em> before. If it would get them to Cloudsdale to help Rainbow? Anything. It's interesting,  how the person who was most prepared to do whatever it took to help Rainbow get over her fears was the one to most completely lose track of the original goal.
<p></p>There are also little things,  like "A Dog And Pony Show",  where she really tired to be civil with the Diamond Dogs. She was <em>happy</em> to show them some gem caches,  until they tried to make her their slave. And part 1 of "Return of Harmony",  where she resisted Discord's temptation the second-longest,  or "Lesson Zero",  where she was the first one to start worrying about Twilight,  before the picnic.
<p></p>...I dunno. I like her because it becomes clear that she really wants to do the right thing,  and make people happy. And if she's a bit vain? Well,  I think she deserves to do a bit of preening. She really is that good at what she does.

            I reckon some of the Earth ponies,  like Pinkie Pie's family,  are geologists.
<p></p>Rarity's cool like that. She can be really nitpicky about things,  but she's basically quite a nice pony.
<p></p>Hmmm. Chaos Emeralds,  the Triforce,  or the Elements of Harmony? Which would you opt for if you needed a powerful relic set?

            I also beleive that Earth Ponies can withstand the elements and nature better than the other types (well,  Unicorns at least).
<p></p>Like if AJ and Rarity were out in the rain,  AJ would be ok,  but Rarity would be developing a serious cold.  And if they encountered non magical dangerous plants,  Rarity would definately be worse off if contact was made.
<p></p>By this logic,  I beleive the 'Earth' versions of the sea ponies are completely immune to the venoms and toxins of all sea lifeforms.  How else would they herd jellyfish? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">

And remember how nice she was to Twilight when she first met her?  And in Return of Harmony Part One,  when she give up her umbrella without being asked?
<p></p>Rarity's a nice pony.

<p></p>I love her because she <em>should</em> be the most selfish one of the mane cast if she were following stereotype,  but her element of harmony is generosity.
<p></p>As far as earht ponies and growing things go,  it must be magic,  because part of what makes the everfree forest so weird is that plants grow without help there.

            depends pretty heavily on the situation - Choas emeralds are good for some shit-wrecking,  but The Triforce nets you "one wish",  which could end something fast. We don' know everything about the elements,  either - we've seen send to the moon,  purge of power,  and turn to stone,  but all we really know is that it's a magical superweapon. We don't really know the extent of its power,  so in that regard it potentially has much more versatility,  at the cost of taking more than one user at a time (presumeably) to be used to full effect.
