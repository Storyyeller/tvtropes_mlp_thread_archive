            ^Bipolar disorder would require her to have lows once in a while (that aren't triggered by feelings of abandonment).  As it is,  it seems like she's just <em>extremely</em> extroverted - she <em>needs</em> to be surrounded by people who she likes and who like her.  She draws her own energy and happiness from being around people are happy.

            It may also be a simple case of a mask covering very deep and severe insecurities. Like the sad pinkie is closer to her actual personality,  and all the zaniness is just covering for it,  or an attempt to attract friends. The real Pinkie is likely somewhere in the middle. But,  well,  We've all heard my ramblings on the subject.

<p></p><em>You know,  it was kinda weird answering that question back there,  because I was just pondering the concept of a VN with the main six as characters. Was wondering what their respective routes would be like. Pinkie's route definitely has to be about getting a look underneath that wacky party-pony demeanor. I imagine the party from Party of One has to be in there somewhere. </em>
<p></p>I was actually thinking about that recently thanks to the release of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatawaShoujo" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatawaShoujo">Katawa Shoujo</a>.

            And that just makes me scared of her if anything.
<p></p>She needs to grow up and learn that people aren't always going to be happy,  and there are times when she's just gonna make things worse if she tries to perk them up via Parties or Zaniness.
<p></p>If she learns that at some point (which I hope that she does),  then I'll have a lot more respect for her <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">

            I'd like to think that Pinkie doesn't have any actual psychological issues (or <em>many</em>,  at least),  but that it was the <em>reason</em> for perceived loss of her friends that was the extra impetus beyond her 'no friends' ground state to 'I have no friends and my old friends hate me'.  Basically,  her level of cheer gained momentum as it fell and was compounded on the way down,  if that makes sense?
<p></p>I mean,  aside from a strict upbringing until the Rainboom,  there's no reason to assume that Pinkie had a traumatizing childhood.  Her parents and sisters certainly reacted well to her party,  so it's not like Mutton and... whatever Pinkie's mom's name is would have told her to shut up and get back in the fields.

She's just afraid that nopony sees,  or likes the real her. All she really needs is someone to be there for her when she's in a bad place,  and she'll start to figure out that her real self is likable,  and then she'll start to even out a bit.

            ^^It would be really interesting to have you in the same room as Pinkie.  You think she needs to grow up,  and she wants you to cheer up. XD  The universe,  as has been said before,  would likely implode.

            @Storyyeller: I think that's a bit different,  the reason being that that defines Derpy's personality because we literally have nothing else to go on.  Yeah,  it became a huge part of the character,  but there's nothing else <em>to</em> the character other than her facial expression,  so this strikes me as a case of "making the most out of what we had to work with".  The other thing is that Derpy's characterization has zero impact on anything else in the story; you could make her a nuclear physicist and it wouldn't really change the way one views the show.  So I think that's a bit different of a situation than trying to argue about something that actually effects everypony in the cast off of a similar basis.

Which is why I hope that "Baby Cakes" teaches her that she can't fix <em>everything</em> with a party.  I mean,  learning that just because you're good at something doesn't mean that you can apply it to any situation is a pretty useful lesson.

            Yeah. Being yourself is good,  but you still need to grow as a person. You'll just be a better yourself. Pinkie can still be happy and energetic,  and she can still love seeing people happy,  but she can direct it a little better. Understand such strange concepts as subtlety,  and sensitivity.

            I just think there's a balance that can be struck here. I have a friend. An amazing friend. He acts EXACTLY like Pinkie does... 50% of the time. The other half,  he's understanding,  he's supportive,  he's quiet,  he's kind.
<p></p>I honestly think that Pinkie could be capable of more reserved moments where she ISN'T being nuts. When she's out and about with her friends she can be over the top and nutty,  but she's also fully capable of calming down and being more reserved when her friends are miserable and it's clear that a party would only make things worse.
<p></p>That'd be the sort of Pinkie I'd like to see

Mare-Do-Well's pretty obviously Pinkie (I <em>think</em>; the whole point of the fic is that Dash herself doesn't know who she is,  but there have been hints),  but even outside the mask,  the way AbsoluteAnonymous portrays Pinkie is pretty interesting.  She gets snappish when Dash ignores her,  sort of thing; she feels very three-dimensional,  and even moreso when you count Mare-Do-Well's writing as an extension of Pinkie's character.

            Meh,  every time this topic gets brought up I find myself agreeing and at the same time disagreeing. Yes she would benefit from some development,  but at the same time I just don't feel like the writers won't give it to her,  because they don't think she really needs it to be entertaining.
<p></p>I've said before that she usually doesn't feel like a real character,  and the show really has not done anything to change that. So in a way you could say I don't believe in Pinkie Pies.

            unfortunately I agree with you on that. IT's part of why I want to see baby cakes be good so badly(though a strange portion of it is really wanting the cakes to have kids),  I desperately want Pinkie to get the development she deserves. She deserves to be a character,  not a walking gag spring.
