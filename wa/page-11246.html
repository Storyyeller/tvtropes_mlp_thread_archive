            I wonder what actually happens on Hearth's Warming Day? Or should I just assume that it's just like Christmas but with elements of Thanksgiving thrown in.

            Goodnight,  Applelight.
<p></p>Anyway,  yeah,  Twilight is going to have to make that call,  but I seriously doubt that she'd move back to Canterlot.  Other than her family and Celestia she doesn't have much tying her down there.  I doubt she'd move back home just to be with family,  and I doubt Celestia would even <em>want</em> Twilight to become too dependent on her by hanging around all the time. Not to mention that Twilight is actually pretty useful in Ponyville,  whereas in Canterlot she doesn't really have a role outside of being a student.  Also all of her friends are in Ponyville.

            @Blue: Regardless of whether the arrangement was meant to be permanent or not,  it seems apparent that Ponyville is here home now. I don't think the show needs to go out of its way to acknowledge this.

<p></p>Well since we are on endings,  I really think that once it does,  in the far far far future end,  the last episode should show the Mane 6 moving on,  each getting their own life,  Twilight back to Canterlot for the next stage after graduating from being Celestia's student,  RD to join the Wonderbolt's,  Rarity off to a big city after hitting it big as a fashion designer like she always wanted,  etc...
<p></p>But also showing,  that they still make time to all get together,  and they all still love each other,  ending the series on the lesson,  that even if your lives take different paths,  and you may become separated from those you care for,  the bond of true friendship can never be broken,  your friends will be there for you,  no matter how many miles away they are.

            <span class="blue">Well I also figured Twilight's eventual role in life would to be Celestia's top Court Wizard.  But I suppose she could settle in Ponyville.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">I wouldn't mind at all though if she moved back.  There's the train that runs between them so she could definitely visit her friends,  Rarity has plenty of reason to visit Canterlot often,  and I'd like to see more of the big city.  Plus,  she could always make some new friends in Canterlot and add some new characters to the cast.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Honestly I think the show could stand to lose a bit of focus on Twilight.  She had the focus for almost the entire first season and she got quite a bit in Season 2 as well.</span>

            I expect that Ponyville would become more important on Equestria's map towards the end of the series,  and one of the final lessons of friendship would be that no matter where you are,  your friends will always be there for you.
Also g'night Apple :D

            @Blue: Why does Celestia even need a wizard?  She's already the most powerful magician in the country.  Personally,  I could see Twilight being a teacher in her school though.
<p></p>Anyway,  I think permanently moving any of the mane cast out of the town would be too much of a shift in the status quo.  I could see it happening temporarily,  or in the series finale,  but I doubt they'd move Twilight to Canterlot and have her commute.

            I personally think that the CMC is one bit of status quo that can't last forever. The majority of their characters are based around one goal that becomes more and more likely to be achieved as time passes,  and the fact that it hasn't been achieved yet becomes less and less believable as well.

            @Blue: Twilight is still the overall series protagonist so I doubt she would lose all that much more focus/screentime. At least she doesn't have to be in every episode like in season one.

            I think she wants to help as many people as she can. She probably thinks she could do that by serving Celestia.
<p></p>But she only thinks that because she's never read any comic books.
