            I told you why I like Twilight. You know why I didn't answer your question? Because I don't care about it. It's honestly not worth the effort. It's like asking how does it feel knowing that Twilight shares the same name as the Twilight book series. I don't care. It might be a problem,  it might not be. So far,  it has had no impact whatsoever on the plot,  and thus,  no reason to worry.

            ok once again,  Twilight doesn't need to learn that there is some better then her,  becuase she doesn't give a buck about being the best,  period. She studies magic because that's what she LIKES doing,  not becuase she's trying to min/max herself.

            @Ginger: For me,  the benefit of Twilight being unmatched is that she fucking <em>earned</em> it. She had enormous potential and talent,  yes. But without work,  talent means nothing. Twilight worked her <em>buns</em> off to be as powerful as she is. I like that. I feel like she's been rewarded for her work,  and I enjoy seeing that happen. Compare with someone like RD who's spectacularly talented,  perhaps even more so than Twi,  but is also extremely lazy,  I don't care so much about her accomplishments. I don't feel as though she's earned them as much.
<p></p>Regarding Twixie,  I can pretty much speak from experience that,  while Twilight might not feel so bad about it,  Trixie would probably <em>detest</em> Twilight. It's unlikely they could ever be anything more than friendly rivals - which I think is possible,  but it makes an actual relationship out of the question.

            How is Twi really overly reliant on her magic,  though?  Yes,  she uses it fairly often,  but she still uses her hooves (she was using the binoculars with them today,  for instance).  And she studies hard because it interests her.  Which is something most people in real life will do.  Rarity and Applejack both make a living off of their talents.  Which would imply they use it every day for long periods of time,  as well.  Does that make them overly reliant on their talents such that they need to learn there's always someone better?
<p></p>And seriously,  Twilight is NOT UNOPPOSED.  Celestia can dispel her magic with little effort and I doubt Luna would be too far behind Celly in terms of power.  As I said before,  Twilight is STILL LEARNING.  I bet the majority of the profs at Celly's School for Gifted Unicorns could still teach her a whole lot about proper use of magic.  And she would eagerly snap up that advice.

<p></p>Goddesses. Twilight's only opposition are GODDESSES. You don't see how that makes her feel OP? Eve is she worked hard to get where she is,  her power level was something she was born with.

            @L Mage: I'm not sure why you're focusing so much on Twilight when the same argument could be made about any other pony.  You might as well ask why AJ spends so much time working the Apple Farm,  or why Rainbow Dash spends so much time flying.  Yet apparently it's only a problem when Twilight does it for some reason.  I honestly don't understand why this is a problem.  Twilight's magic skill should only be an issue if
<p></p>1. It constantly overshadows the other characters (which it doesn't)
<p></p>2. It's a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>  (which it isn't)
<p></p>3. There's no reason for for her to be as good as she is (and there is a reason)
<p></p>I just don't get why Twilight being good at magic can be seen as a bad thing when it doesn't overshadow the other characters,  and there are plenty of reasons for her to be as powerful as she is.
<p></p>Also,  I have no idea where this "Twilight is unopposed" comes from.  She has a lot of <em>raw power and potential</em>,  yeah,  but even after training her entire life it still explodes in her face on a regular basis and she has a myriad of other flaws to balance out her magic skill.  She isn't perfect by a long shot.

            Twilight studies pretty much constantly in her spare time. Dash practices,  yes,  but a good amount of her spare time is just spent chilling. Reasonable,  yes,  but still. Dash also has the air of overconfidence,  while Twi is extremely humble about her talents.
