<p></p>because they had the potential to ACTUALLY be interesting. Instead they ALWAYS succumb to Downer Endings and it's shown time and again that death is unbeatable. Compelling drama that does not make. Why should I care if there's no chance that any of the heroes will survive?
<p></p>Maybe if they showed Death to actually be fallable then it'd work

            That reminds me. I once had an idea for a game where you go through the underworld to bring someone back to life. The final boss is Death but instead of fighting,  you have to beat him at chess. Except that since the computer is extremely good at chess,  what you're supposed to do is secretly switch out the chess game for Connect Four,  which is actually winnable.

            Kidding aside,  I like to imagine that <em>FIM</em> is set in an AU of the Greek mythology 'verse. Discord killed the original Greek pantheon,  then Celestia and Luna deposed him.

            First Final Destination had two survivors,  one died off-screen between films and the other died in the second film. Second film had two survivors,  then they died between 2 and 3. The others have no survivors. Films seem an exercise in pointlessness. Blah blah blah foregone conclusion.
<p></p>I should see <em>The Seventh Seal.</em> It's Bergman's most famous film,  and I've seen <em>Wild Strawberries</em> (one of his other really famous ones) and <em>The Magician</em> (which is... not very famous).

            They're basically gore shows. My friend who likes them admitted he only goes to see them to see how the deaths can get more over the top. Doesn't give two kicks about the plot at all,  or anything.

Yeah,  it's quite good.
