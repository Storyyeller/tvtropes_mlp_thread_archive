            Here's a few more. Let me know if any of these are even worth the effort and I'll stop.
<ul><li> The reason we don't have pegasi is because our geneticists are too lazy. I want my flying mount right now!
</li><li> (Depends on whether Fluttershy's assassinating you now or in a few minutes.
</li><li> Waitwaitwaitaminute. There's a My Little Pony RPG?!?!?!?!!!!!111! Holy Clop,  I've so got to get one of my friends to run this thing.
</li><li> Personally I'm not too worried about what they do with Luna. There's already tons of Alternate Character Interpretation with the the characters that do have canon personalities. It will all still be there when the episode airs,  in fact there will be new <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousinHindsight" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousinHindsight">glorious memes</a> to spawn from Luna alone.
</li><li> Looks like Rainbow Dash always KILLS in style!
</li><li> In applebuck season,  he simply stated the obvious. Everywhere else,  he just eee-'yups,  makes no decisions,  and doesn't display additional intelligence or wisdom. In fact in Winter Wrap Up he was as dumbfunded as the rest until Twilight put stuff in order. She put order in stuff. She stuffed the staff. She staffed the stuff. She's so stuffy. Why is she so stuffy? She should relax and stop being so booky. And she should learn to stuff nests. That's sort of a weak spot.
