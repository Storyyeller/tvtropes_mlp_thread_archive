            @Ginger I <em>just</em> agreed with it. The darkness made her <em>lose</em> her perspective,  so the Elements brought it back. Stop looking for excuses to beat up on yourself.

<p></p>Don't you DARE say that's what she's like in canon. It's not the same

            Trixie I admit was a rather one note Anvilicious braggart. She didn't seem to do much with that little sideshow except talk about how awesome she was. It was a fun episode but a bit simplistic and annoying in places.
<p></p>Pinkie Pie is a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Cloud Cuckoo Lander</a> of the highest order,  but she is at least kinda multi faceted about it,  not just one note crazy.
<p></p>I admit the CMC seemed to get treated rather erratically in P.C. though a recurring theme does seem to be the ponies forgiving people as soon as they've learnt their lesson. They were likely angered because they were still had the nerve to ask for more stories (and likely didn't know about Tiara's blackmail if they didn't).

            @Ginger: The difference is that Pinkie is one of the mane cast members.  She's expected to get a lot of attention.  Trixie was a side character who appeared in one episode,  yet gets comparable attention to the mane cast.
<p></p>That said,  I <em>do</em> think that the fandom overplays Pinkie's 4th wall breaking powers; she really doesn't do 4th wall gags nearly as often as the fans would have you believe.

            @Mio:  With the town's initial reaction,  keep in mind that they just found out about the CMC being Gabby Gums.  I took the town's reaction as partially that initial burst of anger that wears off fairly quickly,  mixed with not wanting to end up as their next story.
<p></p>@Ginger:  Some people like that kind of humor,  and Pinkie is the closest we have to it in canon.  Yeah it's grossly exaggerated,  but whatever.  There are elements of fanon that I don't like,  I just don't read those stories/look at that art.  Let people have their wacky Pinkie.

            If Trixie gets to much attention for being a minor character,  what does that make Derpy? Who gets more attention than the Mane Cast.

            @Ginger: Heaven forbid the fans actually find her endearing.  I'm not a huge fan of her brand of humor either,  but there's nothing <em>wrong</em> with people liking that kind of stuff.
<p></p>Also,  which Dune movie are we talking about?  If it's the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DavidLynch" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DavidLynch">David Lynch</a> one I've heard that it's nigh incomprehensible depending on which cut it is.
