            I dunno I dont think I could have seen Lil Pip being so corrupt as to fall in line with Red Eyes slavery and death motif.  Sure she saw the reason behind his plans but I dont think she would have joined him regardless.

            I mean I think she would've gone along with his Ascention plan.
<p></p>The way I saw it. Red Eye was expecting HER to be in charge. He even said that she probably wouldn't take kindly to using slaves,  but that the groundwork he'd already laid for her using them would allow her to prosper regardless of the methods she employed

            Yea youre right I think she would have gone along with the ascension thing as long as it was just her,  Red Eye and The pegasus I cant remember the name of,  Autumn Leaf maybe?  If the rest of the ponies in the cage were released aftewards and she was in charge.
<p></p>I just couldnt see her going along with the Death pits in Phillydelphia.

            Exactly. She wouldn't have. Red Eye was expecting that. As I said,  he figured she'd stop using the slaves after ascending,  but by that point the slaves would have already built so much that Pip probably wouldn't NEED to use them anymore.
<p></p>He was getting the nasty stuff that he felt NEEDED to be done out of the way first. Then someone more benevolent than he could take over.

            Pretty much the one thing Red Eye feels philosophy wise that differs from Pip is that he feels there always needs to be SOMEPONY ruling over the ponies from a position of absolute power. Ponies can't be left to their own devices. They'd just ruin everything.

            Eh,  now that I think about it,  watching a game playthru would probably dull the effect anyway.  You don't get to love Geese until he pounds your face into the floor for the 20th time,  and I imagine most expert-level playthrus would make him look like a pushover.
<p></p>So what all is going on in Pony-related subjects?

            @Moe Well,  they're expanding the budget for the Bronycon Documentary,  so,  if the goal is reached,  they'll also interview various bronies around the world who couldn't make it.
<p></p>And in news for the thread,  we had a visit from The Doctor.

I don't HATE it or anything,  and I did like some of the stuff in it,  but I kinda find the show overall a bit overrated.
