            we have a special edition of the fanfic report today!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Dear Thread Manor...
<p></p>This is gonna be a bit different than normal! Today,  the report will be about the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/index.php?view=group&amp;group=405">Ponyfall Project<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  a large collaborative effort of 8 fics that all tell the same story from a different perspective!
<p></p>Each story starts the same way. Discord has escaped from his prison yet again,  and has hid the elements of harmony much better this time. Celestia and Luna confront him outside Ponyville,  but things go badly and by the time the girls reach the scene,  sans elements,  Celestia has been subdued and Luna is literally in Discords grasp. Just as Discord unleashes some chaos magic on Luna,  Luna casts a spell of her own,  and the magics collide,  creating an effect not even Discord could have predicted. A sphere of light consumes all present,  resulting in them all being sent to different parts of the Earth,  humanized and robbed of their magic,  where they are found by the various fanfic authors in the project.
<p></p>That's right,  these are all self-insert fics! Despite what you may think about self insert fics,  none of these are all that bad! Infact,  a number of them are quite good! Which is funny,  as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/group/405/ponyfall--a-collaboration-of-selfinserts/thread/9364/ponyfall-facts-and-trivia">it apparently all began as an effort to troll people who hate self insert and humanized pony fics<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  but became something serious when they saw how much attention the stories were getting.
<p></p>Without further ado,  lets get into the stories themselves,  eh? I'll post them in order of what I feel is the best quality fics first. These stories are all in progress,  so I won't bother to mention that bit from here on. And do keep in mind that since these fics are all the same story,  they will all cross over with eachother at some point.
<p></p>These top 3 are all a great read that I'd recommend to anyone!
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15368/ponyfalladventures-in-chaos">Ponyfall: Adventures in Chaos<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Ashton,  a college dropout turned recluse and internet addict of questionable sanity finds a strange homeless man in a mishmash of clothes claiming to be Discord. Convinced it's just a hallucination,  he decides to invite the man into his home. After all,  it's just a hallucination,  what could go wrong? Ashton and the voice in his head soon learn just how mistaken he was...
<p></p>I don't think I've seen a fic do chaos quite as well as this one has. Very entertaining if you don't mind a little mindscrew! <em>Especially</em> during the dream sequence!
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/20289/ponyfall-onward-valiant-crusaders">Ponyfall: Onward Valiant Crusaders<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. John,  a college student in Texas,  was just hoping to skip class when he went for a walk through the woods. He instead finds three little girls claiming to be the Cutie Mark Crusaders. He plays along with them for a while,  even claiming to be another pony in human form in order to calm them down so he can help them,  but soon realizes that this may be the real deal. Him and his two roomates,  Jane and Sybil,  are going to have their work cut out for them taking care of the most rambunctious fillies in Eqestria.
<p></p>yes,  the Crusaders are just as adorable and accident prone as little girls as they are as little fillies.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/16295/ponyfall-australia">Ponyfall: Australia<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Doug Collins has his camping trip in the Outback take a turn for the strange when he encounters two young,  pink haired women claiming to be none other than Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie in the middle of the wilderness. He's sure that they're just hippies/druggies on a real crazy high,  and decides to help them out since it's dangerous in the Australian outback. It's not until he personally experiences the result of breaking a Pinkie Promise that he realizes these two may be telling the truth. Now,  he's going to do whatever he can to help get them back where they belong.
<p></p>Pinkie and Fluttershy make a great combo.
<p></p>These next 3 stories aren't bad or anything,  they're either just missing a certain amount of flair that the ones above have or,  in the case of this next one,  haven't gotten far enough in to get interesting yet.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/48301/ponyfall-leather-and-lace">Ponyfall: Leather and Lace<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. William Parish,  resident of Chicago,  is in that boring period of life between graduating from college and finding a job,  and wishes that something interesting would happen. He gets his wish when he nearly runs over an unconscious women in the middle of the road. He takes her home with him,  intending to simply make sure she's ok then get her on her way,  but when she starts calling herself Rarity and saying that she's a pony,  he realizes he has a bit more trouble on his hands than he thought. When he sees the magic she works with his grandmothers old sewing machine and starts thinking that she may be telling the truth,  he realizes he has a <em>lot</em> more trouble on his hands than he thought...
<p></p>this story is barely far enough in for a proper synopsis. What there is so far is really nice though.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/45926/ponyfall-the-dawning-of-twilight">Ponyfall: The Dawn of Twilight<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Matt Martinez,  a registered nurse in Texas,  and his wife have their evening interrupted when their dog finds an unconscious women in their back yard. He quickly determines that physically,  she's perfectly healthy,  but starts questioning her mental health when she claims to be Twilight Sparkle. Showing her an episode of FiM,  Boast Busters,  in an attempt to prove to her that she is <em>not</em> a pony,  he is shocked when she has an emotional breakdown and tells them how things really happened when the ursa rampaged through Ponyville. It looks like she really is Twilight Sparkle; that kind of emotion simply can't be faked. This is one problem he's not sure he knows how to deal with...
<p></p>This story wasn't doing much for me. There's nothing that's wrong with it or anything,  it just wasn't really catching my interest. Which is interesting,  a apparently Twilight has gone through a number of different authors since the project began. Girl just can't catch a break!
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62905/ponyfall-mile-high-apple-pie">Ponyfall: Mile High Apple Pie<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Garrett,  a currently unemployed biker and kind of a punk living in Colorado,  is surprised to find a blond haired girl unconscious in the middle of a cornfield. He's even more surprised when she starts calling herself Applejack. It's not until he talks to someone online who says they found a rainbow haired girl calling herself Rainbow Dash that he thinks this may be something bigger than just some crazy broad.
<p></p>just like the above story,  this one simply didn't catch my interest.
<p></p>These last two were my least favorite,  and unlike the three above,  I can tell why.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15632/ponyfall-rainbows">Ponyfall: Rainbows<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Cody Lofton,  a highschooler in Indianapolis,  is shocked to find an unconscious girl with rainbow hair in his backyard. Things get even stranger when she claims that she's Rainbow Dash,  fastest flyer in Equestria. He's just a highschooler,  how is he possibly going to deal with this?
<p></p>this story isn't really bad,  per say,  I'm just not a fan of anything in a highschool setting.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/17301/ponyfall-majestic-royalty">Ponyfall: Majestic Royalty<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Gerald McCormack,  a college student living in Atlanta with his butler,  is going for a round on his outdoor obstacle course when he found an absolutely gorgeous woman with pastel rainbow hair passed out in his backyard. He decides he has to help here out and brings her into the house,  but when she starts claiming to be Princess Celestia he begins having second thoughts.
<p></p>I was actually enjoying this story,  but then the latest chapter had a big <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham moment</a> that came out of nowhere and seemed entirely unnecessary,  and then ended on a cliffhanger before anything could be explained. yeah...
<p></p>There you have it! 8 fics all telling the same story form different viewpoints! I,  for one,  am eager to see where this all goes! Until next time!

            well it is a special edition.
<p></p>say,  i don't suppose you could parse the thread and tell me how many fanfic reports I've done? just a search for the term "fanfic report" should do it.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_down.png" alt="[down]" title="[down]" height="16" width="16">I was looking at Lunaverse,  and I might read a few of the stories,  but there's way too much there for me to tackle the whole thing. besides,  a lot of the stories there seem like they stand on their own.

            @Blissey: If you're tackling collaborations,  have you tried the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/RainbowDoubleDashsLunaverse" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/RainbowDoubleDashsLunaverse">Lunaverse</a>? I quite like most of it. My favourite is Symphony for Moon and Sun. Generally,  Lunaverse!Octavia stories are relly good.

            @darkabomination: That's really overstating it. That's <em>one</em> fic in the entire series whoose ending we don't know and is really not as bad as it's claimed to be. Yes,  the Lunaverse is significantly darker than the canonve3rse and that is especially true for that fic,  it's not exactly bleak and hopeless.

            @darkabomination: Really,  no matter how dark the Lunaverse gets though,  I'll still say that Symphony for Moon and Sun justifies  the entire verse's exitence. And it's fairly indipendant too. Though you'd probably want to read Musicians and Dreamers first to understand L!Octavia and L!Lyra and possibly A Canterlot Morning to learn a bit more about her as well as L!Fancy Pants and L!Fleur. (Fleur is a relatively important side-character in Symphony.)
