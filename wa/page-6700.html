Yay,  finally at 6700! I think I wrote 7000 by mistake,  but I meant this.Too lazy to go back to fix it. Double zero landmark!

            Just finished the finale.
<p></p>That. Was. AWESOME! Came in thinking that it'll be a standard wedding finale to sell the new toys,  came out with something that could have passed as an epic <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie">Big Damn Movie</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">to sell the new toys</a>).

            Speaking of that BBBFF song,  a nice little touch during it that helped alleviate a good bit of Shining Armor's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">Remember the New Guy</a> syndrome for me was the fact that they showed him seeing Twilight off when she first left for Ponyville. I love little touches like that.

            <span class="blue">I think this episode sold me on the idea of a movie.  One thing the really need to do though is learn to write some more climactic conflict resolution.  We went from "Changeling Queen has won and no one can stop her" to "and then she gets blasted into the horizon with all of her minions" in like a minute.  It wasn't quite as bad as with Discord,  but still.</span>

            I think the major problem with the conflict resolutions is that they're pretty tight on time a lot. If this finale had been a movie,  then there probably would have been more setup for Armor and Cadence's magic instead of just popping up and winning. I think a similar problem exists for Return of Harmony.

<p></p><span class="blue">While I'm posting random observations: A lot of people were dissapointed that we received no explanation for Cadance being an Alicorn,  and no further elaboration on just what it means to be a Princess in Equestria. I actually feel the opposite.  A lot of scifi/fantasy works rely heavily on exposition and info dumps to characterize their settings.  This often leads to the focus being on the world,  not the plot or characters,  creating a sterile,  dull story regardless of how fascinating the setting might be.  MLP:FIM on the other hand,  presents simple facts and allows the viewer to <em>infer</em> the rest of the information about the setting.  I greatly prefer this style.  It causes the viewer to become more personally involved with the setting,  since they have to think about it a bit,  and also does a good job of preventing accidental plot holes.</span>
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"><span class="blue">Fully agreed,  I just wish they would use their sparing time better so the episodes can have a better ending.  Endings are my little quirk,  I put a LOT of stock in endings.  A bad ending can change my opinion of an entire work.</span>

            He apparently wasn't in this episode,  as far as anyone can tell. He's said that the character he's playing is fairly important,  so it's not like we missed him in a background cameo. I guess we can look forward to him in Season 3 then.

I'm going to assume world backstory and Discord. I have a hard time thinking about any other role he could play,  particularly if it's major.

            I still admire  marketing for this episode. They hyped it as bigger Best Night Ever and no trailer,  clip,  picture,  summary spoiled real plot and real villains.
<p></p>And people complained about  that marketing hype.

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">It's funny because the way the chords are used in this song it called﻿ a Deceptive Cadence. Ingram you smart bastard... </div>
<p></p>Can anyone who knows music explain what that means exactly? I get the pun.
