            @Super Best Friends clip:  I have to admit that it looks kind of horrible to me.
<p></p>Clip from Hurricane Fluttershy,  huh?  Well,  not gonna watch it,  still naively avoiding spoilers.  I did watch the little 30 second commercial they had were Rainbow was giving a rousing speech.  Despite focus being on Fluttershy,  I think this episode may finally be the Rainbow Dash episode I've always wanted.

            I actually really liked the short. But I was kind of surprised that was how they split it up. Not bad,  certainly different though. I think I will really like the main characters. They were all so fun!
<p></p>And yeah,  I want a Rainbow Dash episode where she's nice. I'm hoping she's really supportive of Fluttershy,  as she has been coming off as kind of jerky lately. &gt;&lt;

I know they've brought back the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT-N1ofHV2I">Teen Titans<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in chibi form. Lauren,  being a genius,  probably decided that instead of doing a bunch of short stories she'd make one long one and cut it up into little pieces. This way she can get people interested in her work and they ask for more. Then she can use the complete un-cut version of the show as a pilot to pitch to the execs. Granted this is just a theory but I wouldn't be at all surprised if this is all part of Lauren's master plan.

I doubt it was originally supposed to be a standalone cartoon; they probably wanted something more like long ad bumpers,  but she went ahead and made something more complex.

<p></p>She's been coming off as very supportive of her friends (especially Fluttershy) and generally more thoughtful and less callous lately,  to me.

<p></p>No,  I'm putting down on it because the comedy was painfully bad and the characters seemed shallow and unlikeable.  I also dislike the art.

            Disliking the art style =/= <em>bad</em>,  per se.

<p></p>Anyway,  RD has been shows a being a bit nicer (especially to Fluttershy),  but it's not in focus enough to counteract stuff like MMDW.  Which is a pity,  because I thought that episode really didn't do her character justice.
<p></p>And now I have classes to go to and won't be back till tonight.  See you guys later.

<p></p>I'll certainly grant you that one.  I believe in giving things a 2nd (and sometimes 3rd) chance.
