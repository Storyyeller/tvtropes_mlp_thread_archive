            AJ and Fluttershy would probably handle it rather well.  Rainbow Dash and Pinkie... they <em>could</em> do well if they can reign in their impulses.  Rarity could really go either way.  She's certainly used to working under stress at any rate.

            Well,  given that said powers only seem to be given to those who display <em>all</em> the elements of harmony,  they probably wouldn't get the powers unless they were capable of handling them.  I could see them learning to buckle down and treat the position with the respect it deserves.  Rarity does let her ego get ahead of her sometimes,  but she's well aware of it and actively tries not to let it happen.  Rainbow Dash has demonstrated that she's willing to sacrifice her dreams for her principles,  so she could probably learn to cope.  They'd have more difficulty than say,  AJ,  but I think they could manage.
<p></p>That said,  I doubt they'd ascend any more characters unless they do so in the series finale.

            Rainbow Dash becomes the goddess of weather.... and goes mad with the power.  Has to be taken down by the others a la Nightmare Moon.
<p></p>Rarity... she'd go mad with power but instead of floods and hurricanes everyone would have to wear the finest clothing and take etiquette lessons... probably not quite as bad as RD as she could be taken down with clashing colors in an outfit <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            Dangit,  everytime someone mentions this "Unicon" thing,  I keep accidently misreading it as <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformersTheMovie" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformersTheMovie">Unicron</a>.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>Also,  that Double Rainboom fan episode looks really awesome. The fact that it seems to have both my favorite ponys as the main charectors helps too.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii"> The only thing I don't understand is this: People have been complaining about the brief appearence of Trollface,  but it's been there ever since the first animatic for this fan episode came out about a year ago. Why are people only NOW complaining about it when it's been there for a long time?

            I think it's because 1. They don't like the idea of something like that appearing so obviously because it clashes a bit with the tone of the show and 2. they're only complaining now because they probably assumed it would just be a placeholder and not there in the final version.

            I'd like to see an interpretation of Vinyl in which she isn't obsessed with WUBS.  Especially since all the music she's actually been heard playing the show isn't dubstep.

<p></p>It's a matter of scale. Pinkie can't do anything on the level of Discord. And as I've said before,  Pinkie doesn't need to have <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarping" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarping">Reality Warping</a> in order to do everything she does.
<p></p>That said, the other Mane 5 ascending would end most of my complaints.
<p></p>Personally,  I <em>also</em> think that the bearer of magic doesn't need to be a unicorn. Nor do I think that unicorns are better than pegasi or earth ponies. I just wish that was more obvious.
<p></p>I like JT's ideathat thereare other artefactsout there for the other nations,  but disagree on them being involved in deciding succession. Twilight was implied to be the first alicorn to have ascended ratherthanbeing born that way.

            I agree that the element of Magic doesn't have anything to do with actual unicorn mgic. It's really a major misnomer that Twilight placed on the Element.
<p></p>I mean,  look at Hearth's Warming Eve. Clover specifically notes that the power that destroyed he Windigoes was nothing that any unicorn can do. It might have manifested through a unicorn's horn,  but it was something far more than that.

            @JT: I did write a story with her once,  and while I don't consider it good by any measure it has been said to have one of the most interesting interpretations of her - she's blind,  which makes a hefty part of her(Very thin,  which is why I consider the story bad) personality. Never decided on a particular brand of music,  but I always figured she would experiment with different forms of electronic.

            I guess they can have the rest of the ascend,  but honestly I think if they did then the series should probably and and/or move on to something else since there is really not much more that you can do with them.
<p></p>Anyway,  I have taken <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JTeeth" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JTeeth">J Teeth</a>'s advice from yesterday and turned my analysis/commentaries a liveblog that I have linked in my sig for anyone who is interested. For now the tentative order for the Mane Six is next Fluttershy,  followed by Applejack,  Rarity,  Rainbow Dash,  and finally Twilight Sparkle. You can expect these next installments to come out some time before the realese date of Kingdom Hearts 3.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
