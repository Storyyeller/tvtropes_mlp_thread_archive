            @Ginger: I think in that case I will agree with you (I'm assuming we get to see all the rounds in detail). It probably would have been better to compress those opening rounds into a sort of victory montage,  it would establish the cons proficency without bogging the story down with tensionless battles.

<p></p>Uh,  those are two COMPLETELY different langauges. The only similarity is the name.
<p></p>Also @JT,  I think it's because Firefox disbales the Java plugin by default due to security issues.

            @ginger: Ah,  then in that situation I'm inclined to agree with you. It sounds like it's supposed to sort of be an 'intellectual' take on the standard shonen tropes,  so it seems pointless and contrary for him to be defeating too many opponents handily. Just having random burks that he waltzes over,  sure,  but named character should provide a challenge,  or else what's the point?

<p></p>Yeah. I know the basics of the language,  but I'm not very <em>good</em> at them. Either way,  Java is the first language I learned,  and javascript the second.

<p></p>Not at all. Javascript has more in common with Python than Java. The only reason it's even called Javascript is because Java was a big fad at the time and they wanted to steal some of the popularity.

            @Story: Ah,  right. Yeah,  we learned a <em>bit</em> of the history in the class itself,  but I was always more concerned with trying to figure out the scripting itself. And since I never got too advanced,  I don't know much of the differences beyond pure syntax.
<p></p>I know that Python runs on loops,  but I don't know much of anything else.

            Going by the first sentence of the Wikipedia article. Javascript is dynamicly typed,  weak typed,  has first class functions,  and is multi paraidgm. Java is statically typed,  strong typed,  doesn't have first class functions (except arguably Java 7),  and only supports the OO paradigm.

            A teacher's given me a name of a brand of coding books,  and I know a free engine I can practice in,  so I'm going to try learning C,  yeah...
<p></p>I <em>know</em> scripting is important to learn,  but it's always been my weakest subject. It's not the logic,  even - I get the logic just fine - it's that I simply have troubles remembering the language. Once I become more ffamiliar with a language I can use it fine,  unfortunately the only one I've had to use very much has been Action Script 3,  which is... not terribly advanced. I mean,  it's no gamemaker,  but still.
<p></p>That,  and the whole thing is just sort of... <em>imposing</em>. For anything even halfways complex it requires so much code,  and it's so easy to mess up and never be able to find the error because it's just one damn little typo in a forest of thousands of lines and words.

            C? I think you should start with Python. Unlike other languages,  it is both powerful and easy to learn.

            Think so? I'd been recommended one of the C languages first - C sharp,  C++,  something like that.
<p></p>I've already got a <em>bit</em> of experience in Python,  since that's the language the GECK uses and I needed to do some scripting when I was working in that. I don't know if it's enough to make a difference,  but it should at least help that I already have a basic handle on the syntax... hopefully.

            You were probably recommended C#,  since it's higher level (and hence easier) and it lets you make <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XBox" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XBox">Xbox</a> games. Unfortunately,  it's Microsoft only. C++ is lower level and incredibly complicated. You will use it in major studios,  but only for coding engines,  where performance is critical. C is not seriously used in Game Dev anymore,  AFAIK. It's main use is for writign stuff like operating systems.
<p></p>Anyway,  I can assure you that Python is much easier and nicer to work with than C#.

            Huh... well,  alright. I'll start learning Python,  and then I guess try out C# when I get more proficient with it...
<p></p>The engine I know of to practice on(Besides GECK,  I mean) is Unity,  and it seems to function with any language. Although it does have specific options for Java scripts,  C# scripts,  etc. As long as a game uses a single type of script I'm sure it should be fine.
<p></p>It's odd,  though - I could have sworn that the game I worked on with the student team used C as the major language. Must just be C# or something.

            It has come to my attention that we need a page for John de Lancie. And Michelle Creber. And Kathleen Barr. Something to strive for over the summer,  give all the pony actors tropes pages.
<p></p>At least John de Lancie if no one else,  he's a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarTrek" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarTrek">Star Trek</a> actor! I'm surprised he doesn't have one. I'd make the pages myself but I already made <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndreaLibman" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndreaLibman">Andrea Libman</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HeyOcean" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HeyOcean">Hey Ocean</a>,  I don't want to make <em>all</em> the pony actor-related pages!

            Well you <em>could</em> make a game in C,  but it's generally a bad idea. C is basically glorified assembler,  so you have to do everything yourself. So you shouldn't code in C unleess you have a very good reason to do so.
