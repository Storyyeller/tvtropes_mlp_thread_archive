            Made an edit. Also,  it's important to remember that wizarding culture opporates on a completely different scale to muggle culture. Theirs is completely dwarfed by ours. Hogwarts is the only wizard school in <em>the entire British Isles</em>. And it only has about 800 students! 200 of which are muggle-born!

            I mean really. If the wizard factions are anything like real life governments,  then the American or EU wizards could team up and take him out in a matter of months.
But that's the problem. After Goblet of Fire which only gave hints,  we're given no international presence whatsoever. For me it gave off the impression that England was rather isolationist.

<p></p>No,  I understand <em>why</em> wizards are so secretive - in the past I imagine muggles weren't overly friendly. The Wizards just.. don't seem to be able to keep up with the times.
<p></p>The point about population is valid,  though. I mean,  almost confusingly so,  because my highschool had about the same student body as Hogwarts,  covering half the grades,  and only served students in a small region of Manitoba. Comparing that to a collection of countries... yeah. Not overly populous. Which is kind of confusing,  because Magic seems to be a fairly pervasive gene. You'd think breeding with muggles would help spread it out and about a bit.

            I don't know what you mean. Do you mean who we <em>want</em> to be stuck with?
<p></p>Twilight and Applejack,  obviously. Well,  I <em>think</em> Twilight has some knowledge on wild-life survival.
<p></p>Although,  depending on animal population,  I might take Fluttershy instead of Twilight.

<p></p>Now,  if we were to compare to ponies,  Celestia's school is advanced,  but clearly some magic training is standar among unicorns.

            @Kegi:  With regards to industry,  I got the sense that it isn't a bigger thing because for most wizards magic makes a lot of it unnecessary.  For your fridge example,  most wizards probably already know a spell that preserves their food,  so why would they spend however much on a magic fridge?  I imagine that the only things produced are those with complex or specialized magic.

            Watching the "Boast Busters" sub. The scene where RD picks a fight with Trixie is actually pretty well written,  if the subs are accurate. It makes the cast's derision for Trixie seem like less of an overreaction.  It also makes Twilight's reluctance to show off more understandable (one of Rarity's lines is something like "just because you can do all sorts of magic doesn't make you better") or something,  which seems more directly applicable to Twilight's situation.

            Well,  yesterday and today were pure hell,  but I've made enough progress in my school work that I'm not in a state of constant panic anymore. If I can keep up this rate,  I'll have what I need done by the end of the semester. If anything else goes wrong though,  I'm completely and utterly fucked.

            @CDRW:  I've been in that spot before in my life,  where things seem to come crushing down.
<p></p>As of right now,  the family's getting stressed out again over the old computer of mine.  Ugh...  sometimes,  I <em>wish</em> my older brother wouldn't be so darned stubborn!  (Hurts that I can't really raise my voice upon him.)

            I hope to god a mass apology on behalf of them will pull them back.  I'm just going to say folks,  at the end of the day,  it's a fucking cartoon.  To attack someone over it with such venom that they consider quitting their jobs is frankly,  pathetic.

            Easy there,  Applelight. People (like me) have very short attention span. Just give it a month or two after the release of the movie,  and pretty soon enough it will be as if none of this ever happened.
<p></p>Also,  this is a topic for EQG thread.

            ...well that put a dampener in my mood. Our good relationship with the writers is vital,  we don't want them to hate us,  or quit. Or both.
