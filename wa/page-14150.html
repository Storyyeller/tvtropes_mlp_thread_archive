            I discovered the show when I kept hearing more and more people talk about it back in early 2011. At first I dismissed it,  but when it got to the point where I heard that people like Weird Al,  Seth Green and a couple online video creators I liked were fans of the series,  I had to check it out.
<p></p>I looked up random episodes of the show,  and the very first one I watched was Sonic Rainboom. Needless to say,  I was shocked at how great the animation was and how good the jokes were {I also got a kick out of the fact that one of RD's bullies is ovbiously voiced by the same person who voiced Kevin in Ed Edd 'n Eddy},  and the climax of the episode was freaking epic.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/cool.png" height="16" width="16" alt="cool" title="cool"> I also ended up watching Bridle Gossip,  which I loved too. But there were a couple things that prevented me from watching all the episodes immediatly and becoming a brony: I was already distracted since I was in the process of watching <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuYuHakusho" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebop" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a> as time went on,  along with the various video games and movies I had on my to do list. So I put off watching the show for the time being.
<p></p>Eventually I finally got done with all the other stuff I was playing/watching,  and I got so bored that I went back and started watching more episodes of Mlp Fim. As soon as I was done,  I started checking out the fanworks of the show like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryOfTheBlanks" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryOfTheBlanks">Story of the Blanks</a>,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalloutEquestria" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalloutEquestria">Fallout Equestria</a> and other fanfics,  and I eventually got into stuff like shipping and fan speculation. The show's fanbase is so great that it's what inspired me to get some online accounts and interact with other bronies {Before this,  I was just a lurker who never got actually involved in online stuff}. And now here I am.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            I got into the show because I love memes. Eventually,  I noticed that ponies were popping up in all the memes I liked,  and all the ones I didn't like,  and all the other ones as well,  so I eventually gave the show a try.

<p></p>You know,  that is actually a good question; I never actually gave a coherent thought on this. I doubt that it is an actually good answer.
<p></p>Maybe it's because I find all the show's attempts to become serious laughable at best? I don't know.

            I'm with ya there,  Apple. I'm having one of those morning after regret fests- where it looks great when I first draw it,  but now I just notice everything that's wrong with it. It's sitting on my Sta.sh on DA waiting for me to upload it,  but I just can't.
<p></p>I have this site to blame for this show too. I saw it on here,  though "Oh,  that looks cute- Oh hey that lady worked on PPG? I loved that show! Maybe I'll check it out." I didn't really get around to it,  until I was channel surfing with my mom and we came across the show. I had gone through a bit of a phase where I didn't like anything "girly",  so when my mom saw it she teasingly goes: "Look,  Miranda! My Little Pony!" (Little did she know,  I was in the process of re-watching Sailor Moon again.)
<p></p>"Yeah,  I've actually heard good things about this version." So I watched. With my mom. The <em>girliest</em> episode: Suited for Success. Right as the song came on. And all I could think was: "My mom is going to think I've gone completely insane."
<p></p>It wasn't until the very end,  where Rarity has her little break down,  when I started to loosen up. Much to my surprise,  my mom laughed at a couple of the jokes too. (Mostly at Pinkie's crazy cat lady comment- which is a running gag at my house.) After that episode,  I rushed upstairs and marathoned the whole season into the wee hours of the morning; up until the latest episode. (I think it was Over a Barrel,  at that point.)
<p></p>Now my dresser looks like a rainbow threw up on it,  and I have no regrets.

            Personally,  I think the subpages are getting too overblown and this fandom likes to play up the few dark moments way too much in attempt to make it seem somehow better,  but that's just my opinion. This show's fine as a self-aware but still cute and idealistic program for girls.
<p></p>That said I don't mind dark works,  it's just annoying me.

            Overblown sounds about right.
<p></p>For example,  from Awesome page,  folder - Yeah,  apparently there are so many awesome moments it deserves folders; give it a page for each season,  why don't they? - Season 1 has:
<p></p><em>Rainbow Dash really does clear the sky in ten seconds flat.</em>
<p></p><em>Applejack bounding her way down the cliff effortlessly,  being the only flightless pony to save herself from the cliff collapse.</em>
<p></p><em>Applejack,  even though it was something she shouldn't have done,  earned one by harvesting half the farm's apple trees by herself. Sweet Apple Acres is really big (there's a reason it's called Sweet Apple Acres),  so it's likely not an easy feat to harvest half the apples in the entire area within the span of a couple days. Yet Applejack still managed it.</em>
<p></p><em>Twilight deserves some credit for telling a Ghost Story scary enough to cause Applejack and Rarity to Security Cling.</em>
<p></p>Seriously? These are supposed to be <em>awesome?</em>
<p></p>Yes,  I know,  awesomeness and whathaveyou are totally subjective,  but this is just ridiculous.

            I think those moments qualify as <em>impressive</em>,  but yeah,  awesome is probably overstating it a bit.  The Sonic Rainboom is awesome; kicking clouds really quickly,  not so much.
<p></p>But the problem is that the inherent subjectivity of those pages means there's no way to really keep them clear because the only other options are to either say that they have to be unanimous,  at which point every page of every work is going to be blank,  or rig up some sort of voting system which is just a pain in the butt.

            I am not going to deny; there are plenty of legitimately awesome moments,  like:
<p></p><ul><li> Sonic Rainboom

</li><li> Celestia sending all the letters back to Twilight to break Discord's spell.

            @Applelight: I'd agree,  but the way those pages are defined basically boils down to "You can put something up there so long as one person finds it to fit the criteria". I.e. if one person finds something awesome and adds it,  it's technically valid even if nobody else agrees with them.

            That's why I tend to not really mess with those pages very often.  I occasionally go to the funny moments page for a pick-me-up,  but other than that I don't really bother much  because it's just a list of "moments fans find funny",  and with a show with such a large fanbase,  there's going to be somebody who finds <em>everything</em> funny.
