            You should have dislocated his shoulder instead. The screams are much more appealing.

            Applelight,  anyone ever tell you that while revenge is the right way to go,  there is a limit and tearing up faces is beyond that limit? Same with slamming fingers in doors. At that point,  it becomes bullying.

            just use the Ender Wiggins approach. Don't just stop once he's down,  make sure that he is so utterly defeated both physically and mentally that he will NEVER even think about messing with you again. Defeat him for all time.

            Uh,  I'll be honest Apple,  it sort of sounds like you were bullying him.  I mean,  I'm sure he was an asshole,  and fighting him if he attacks you is fine,  but if it got to the point where you were attacking him every time you saw him then that's taking things too far.

            At some point I basically made it be known that I wasn't afraid to berserker folks and no-one dared trying me ever again. Apple you just need to tame your anger is all. Vigilante action isn't justice. Far more satisfying to legally destroy the opponent and make them unwilling to ever come after you again.

            man,  everyone but me have a rough time in midschool? I was in a catholic school for k-7,  the worst that happened there was verbal abuse. Although I think we actually drove one kid out of the school one time...but I swear,  he was seriously trying to get himself mocked!
<p></p>of course,  then I went to a military highschool for 9-12...
