            The trick being that you have to make exercise into a scheduled event. For me I prefer just grabbing a bar,  some weights,  and a bench and that's enough to work up a sweat. Machines do have some uses,  but it isn't anything you couldn't do on your own and people get in a habit of letting them do all the work for them. When it's just you and a heavy weight,  there's more of a feeling of personal challenge.
<p></p>At my prime two years ago I could run two miles and bench press 235 pounds. Not the greatest,  but I thought it was pretty good.

            I sweat <em>way</em> too much already. I have problems there. I ... well let's not mince words. I stink. Recently I've been thinking of checking to see if a medical proffesional can do something about that.

            <div class="quoteblock"> I've never been able to enjoy exercise for it's own sake. I can certainly see the benefits and there are a lot of fun activities that involve getting exercise,  but I've never been like "You know what I want to do today? Run five miles."

<p></p>Walking on a treadmill is nice because you can read stuff on the laptop at the same time,  depending on the treadmill. Other than that,  excercise is mostly an annoyance.

Mine is nowhere near as spectacular,  but I had fun drawing it. And with my new Bioshock art book in hand,  I hope to draw some more. Maybe even redraw some of my older stuff.
<p></p>I've had trouble exercising because I had problems with my feet getting sore quickly. Turns out I have flat feet,  so I wear special shoes for long distances now. I actually love 'em to death. Plus,  I've pretty much restricted my beverage intake to water and the occasion milk.

            ^^ I had a pretty good run of several years where I was only drinking soda if I was eating out (which was once in a blue moon),  visiting my parents,  or at work (free soda fountain drinks :P),  and only kept cranberry juice around the apartment.
<p></p>I've fallen off that wagon,  but at least I mostly stick to Sierra Mist,  which is marginally better,  since it doesn't have high fructose corn syrup.

<p></p>You'd be missing on being able to read(unless you're awesome or know the territory,  like I did back in my hometown),  but at that point why not just go for walks? I don't as much as I used to,  since I now go to a bank further away(Thanks o it being in proximity of a comic book store that I visit weekly... and regularly spend 40-80 dollars,  I think the owner is starting to like me),  but I used to go for a walk to pick up my rent every week. IT was nice. IT helped that the bank I went to was in my favourite part of the city.
<p></p>Recently I've been considering tying to go healthy. I pretty much drink only water at home,  and I've been trying to cut down on the pop at work(They have fridges full of free drinks,  so the temptation doesn't make it easy). Plus,  a friend of mine has recommended a diet with decent-tasting food and an exercise thing he says worked for him. The only worry is money and time,  really. Especially since my Student loans might be kicking in again soon,  since APPARENTLY they have different personal information for me than I do,  so I can't make an account to re-apply for aid,  and I can't get a hold of them because I'm too busy working. Gonna try to contact them this Friday,  which I'm not doing OT on.
<p></p>Also,  while in my 'prime' I never really checked on my endurance(But an hour solid of wrestling is tiring,  believe me),  but I was once able to lift my 120-pound brother one handed. That general weight-range is still pretty easy for me with two hands. Not sure about upper limits,  really.

            I <em>do</em> have foot problems,  but that's more with them getting blisters easily. Actually,  I have sensitive skin in general.
<p></p>ED I used to do Judo when I was in primary school for a ew weeks. But then my sister threw me and I landed badly,  breaking my foot. So I stopped. Something of a pity. It would have been useful to continue.

            Used to be a black belt in tae kwon do.  Then I got a nasty case of ingrown toenail.  I won't go into the nasty details,  but suffice to say you can't really do tae kwon do when you can't kick.

<p></p>It did teach me how to hold my own in a confrontation though.  It's amazing how many angry,  aggressive and confrontational people back down after making a threat of physical violence against you when you launch the first punch or elbow.
<p></p>Not that I go looking for trouble but,  as I often mention here,  my area is rough,  and full of people used to settling their disputes physically.

            Hey - better to have it and not need it,  right? Besides,  combat sports are just kind of inherently fun,  for me. Straight up,  as-much-as-you-can exertion against a single opponent. No room for uncertainty who was better. And this is coming from a pacifist.

            I only drink soda when going to a restaruant or there's nothing else available. It's a relatively painless way to improve your diet (I'm a picky eater so I have trouble finding anything healthy to eat),  and soda has pretty much no nutritional value,  unlike say,  pizza.
