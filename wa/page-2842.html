            @Ginger: that you can't solve everything everytime? That when you've exhausted everything maybe you should call on help,  that would be the responsible thing to do? I agree that the resolution is weak,  by the way. It's not like they've never ended things with the main character being scolded before (Lesson Zero).

            Honestly,  I'm annoyed because it's Pinkie. The character who's NEVER gotten in any real trouble for her actions. and she was basically handed salvation on a whim by the babies.
<p></p>I would've preffered it if the Cakes DID come back and got angry with her,  but she vowed to become more responsible and be ready for the next time she had to babysit them

            The moral works fine,  as long as you take it in a very broad way,  "babies are a lot of responsibility,  sure you can have fun playing with them,  but you also need to take care of them." It's just a very simple but true moral,  that many younger people need to learn. And even has the added benefit of not JUST being about taking care of babies but also in general way it's saying,  "Don't bite off more then you can chew". Don't take on responsibilities you can't handle.

            Yeah,  I'm sure we all did. But hope springs eternal,  and all that.
<p></p>I still say that she actually <em>did</em> handle it as well as you could. Getting the kids to <em>like</em> you is pretty much the only way anything is going to get done. She might not have did it on purpose,  but she did discover one of the secrets of taking care of kids.

            As to the foals just being nice after Pinkie cries, even that makes sense,  sure there babies,  but there also ponies,  and ponies are just naturally incredibly caring and nice,  sure they gave Pinkie hell before,  but they didn't understand they were doing anything wrong or that Pinkie was upset,  it wasn't till she started crying they understood,  since that's what they do when there upset,  so there pony instincts kicked in and they tried to cheer her up.
<p></p>I love it,  it's both heartwarming on a personal,  awww the babies really do love her,  and a meta,  ponies are just THAT sweet and nice,  level.

            As for spoiler policy: we have a big build-up towards the moment where we can watch the streams,  usually several pages long detailing how long until it airs and where we will be watching. I think that's big enough of a warning sign to people who haven't watched the episode yet.

            Dude,  she was failing for the entire episode.  The whole thing was bad things happening to Pinkie.  You're upset that things managed to pick up for her in the last few minutes?  Of course that was going to happen.

            Ginger...for the love of Celestia...it's just like the people that complained about Rarity not getting caught lying in Sweet and Elite,  they didn't NEED to get caught to learn a lesson,  and that is just BRILLIANT to show,  instead of fostering the idea most shows do that you need to learns this lesson because if you don't you'll get caught and in trouble,  this show instead just shows why you should learn the lesson,  even if you'd never get caught....if that made any sense.
