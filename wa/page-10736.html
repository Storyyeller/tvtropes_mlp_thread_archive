            @Perpetual Lurker: There is a solar system model that says that the sun and moon go round the Earth and everything else goes round the sun. I believe that the show uses that model.

            I tend to lean on the side of geocentricity for the setting,  mainly because I think it's more consistent to have the ponies controlling the seemingly natural occurrences.  It just fits the setting more,  and Celestia would have to be <em>stupidly</em> powerful to move the entire planet around a full sized son.  It's possible,  but I think it just makes more sense to say that the sun and moon are just heavenly bodies that Celestia and Luna can move around because they're smaller than in reality.  That and I think that it's a lot easier to just explain the meteor shower as occurring some other way rather than to assume it works just like it would in reality and then extrapolate Celestia's and Luna's abilities from it.

            I don't see how Twilight having a brother was such a big deal. Sweetie Belle being Rarity's sister kinda came out of nowhere,  too. The characters don't talk about their families much at all,  even when we know that they exist. When has Pinkie ever mentioned either of her sisters? In fact,  I don't think that she even mentioned them in her dialog in Cutie Mark Chronicles. We just saw them in the flashback.

They were close when she was a child,  but he enlisted in the military and left home even before she did. They apparently kept in touch,  but didn't see each other as much.

            I think the Alicorns are extremely powerful. At least as powerful as the combined unicorn race. A lot of their power is tied up to their heavenly body.

Also,  it's an older brother,  which means he could easily have moved out of the house for some reason at a point on the timeline before Twilight's flashbacks.
