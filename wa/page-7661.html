Not a stretch to assume AJ took out the other two,  and yes proceed to complain that it wasn't shown....</span>

<p></p>What numbers were you trying? It took me less than a minute to find 6^2 = 23 mod 13. If you have x^2 = 13n + 10,  that's the first thing you'd try!

            Well,  I kind of enjoy Rainbow Dash as either straight or bisexual to be honest. One should not judge by appearance.
<p></p>Anyway,  off to have dinner. See y'all later.

            hmmm evil villans based on Loaylty,  kindness,  and Generosity.
<p></p>not to hard to see.,  one villian gets in good with the Mane 6,  gains there trust,  then betrays them.
<p></p>One is just a complete psycho..though must of the harder kindness reverses would be to evil for a kids show..i'd say a villian that wants to ensalve al the ponies out of of concern for them,  thinking it would be better for them to be safe in a gilded cage where he can take care of them then out free where they can get hurt.
