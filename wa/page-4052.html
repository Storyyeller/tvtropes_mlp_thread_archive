<p></p>As much as I want to see it too,  this is a show for little girls,  they wouldn't go out of their way to show a fight scene unless it was ABSOLUTELY 100% vitally important.

            So my pony dealer uploaded the new episode and I finally got to see it.
<p></p>Despite being a Pinkie fan,  this one was meh for me. I'm not sure why but it just didn't click for me. The song was nice though. Oh well,  next week's Fluttershy episode looks good.
<p></p>What was the general consenous here? I don't want to search though eighty pages. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">

<p></p>I thought it was distinctly MEH (It annoyed me,  but not to the point of rage). Cranky was awesome,  and I do like the song. (even though it depresses me)

Didn't think anything would top that. Why does the song depress you? It's one of the most cheerful things I've ever heard.
<p></p>One thing I found weird about the episode was that the ponies wern't scared/racist towards the donkies like they were to Zecora. Why?

            well,  it's clear donkeys have been around awhile,  while Zecora was the very first Zebra they ever saw,  plus she lived in the Everfree Forest,  which is really what convinced the ponies she was scary.
<p></p>Overall,  yeah in this thread huge split,  but no where near MMDW levels,  it's just the biggest one besides that.
<p></p>And Ginger gets depressed by the song because he loves it so much,  it embodies everything he likes about Pinkie and wishes he could see more.

            @Purple Dalek Because I wish Pinkie could be that pleasant all the time. It shows the caring side to her that I honestly like. It just makes me sad when I remember that it's normally buried beneath a fuck ton of insensitivity and obnoxiousness.
<p></p>I'll probably like it more,  the more I listen to it though.
<p></p>Maybe Donkeys are native to Equestria wheras Zebras aren't.
