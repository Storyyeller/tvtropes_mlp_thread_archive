            Some more stupid arguments(this person <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockyCrowe" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockyCrowe">Rocky Crowe</a> thinks liking ponies is a mental illness). Now maybe I'm not familiar with all the anti-brony arguments but it struck me as hypocritical and utterly distasteful. And just plain stupid.
<p></p>"Just the﻿ fact that you said that is pretty ignorant..
don't DENY IT. EAT IT and THINK for a sec.
Grown men who're watching that and ARE LEGIT FANS of it have some issues more than likely..there's no getting around it...
your not gonna go around town asking guys on the street is they wanna go to bronycon with you...ya know why?? BECAUSE REAL MEN AREN'T INTO THAT YA PISS ANT!
this is a fandom that has a strict circle for a reason..because any normal man wouldn't be slightly intrested -3-."
<p></p>"OMFGOSH!! WHY DO YOU FRIGGIN BRONIES ALWAYS USE THAT AS YOUR BACK UP!!!
It's so unbelievably stupid I can't even..ju-just OMG! XD
It's called MARKETING. OF COURSE the animators &amp; executives﻿ are going to encourage the Brony fandom,  because that puts thousands of more dollars into THEIR POCKETS! You seriously think they'd support this behaviour otherwise?! HELL NO!
and I'm pretty sure they wouldn't make the Exorcist for little girls- thats a real poor example buddeh.."
<p></p>"DUDE. The artist is paid by the company they work for - which is in turn making a shitton of money off of people like YOU...
They don't have to support it.even if the artist is sick an tired of animating ponies all day,  in the end,  thier gonna﻿ get a FAT paycheck for all their efforts! AND ONCE AGAIN they'll promote it based on that premis!
&amp; these aren't STANDARDS it's INSTINCT. You Bronies remind me very much so of neutured dogs...ur mental wiring's been messed with."[/QUOTE]
<p></p>...but SOMETIMES shit goes to far..there's a difference between a man who may like to cook/clean &amp; sow then a man who watches a F-ING MAGICAL PONY SHOW!!
there's just no way in HELL! this isn't a star trek fandom,  comics, minecraft or anime etc.....its F-ING PONIES![

<p></p>Funny you should say that since Grilled Cheese Sandwhiches are so rarely made with actual cheese. The traditional recipe involves American 'Cheese Product'.

<p></p>Also,  my brother had a minor rant again. He said that he thinks that the whole brony thing is a hipster's fad. I said: "It's been going on for about two years. It's beyond a fad,  I'm figuring."
<p></p>I think he has twigged on to me,  but isn't saying anything. Which is good,  I guess.

            I'm sure there were some folks joining the pony fandom ironically,  or just because it was popular. But I'm pretty sure they would have been driven away by the DRAMA DRAMA DRAMA associated with season 3.

            I never really felt much involving season 3 drama. I am sure that I don't have to remind you folks how much I absolutely loved the ascension.
<p></p>For some reason,  though,  season 2 finale is the one that made me stop referring myself as a brony; just a pony fan.

            Make your own garlic butter by letting a stick of butter get to room temp... mix in garlic,  parsley,  salt,  and whatever else floats your boat then plop it on some plastic wrap and roll into a tube... stick in the fridge and slice off bits when you want it.
