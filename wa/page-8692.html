            bad does have a point,  though. In a straight up fight,  the Pegasi would have the advantage because of their combat experience. Earth ponies have the food advantage,  though. They could probably stall out the fight until the pegasi were exhausted. Maybe align themselves with the Unicorns to be able to reach and finish them off.<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> They're both better than pegasus-es-es-es,  anyway.</div></span>

            They were throwing <em>pies</em> at them,  Bad. They weren't <em>trying</em> to kill them. Also,  they managed to knock them out still. With <em>PIES</em>
<p></p>A farmer's militia is actually a frightening force. A significant portion of the martial arts of the world were developed by farmers trying to defend themselves,  and a huge chunck of the kung-fu armory were modified farming implements. Consider that a farmer has natural training with things like spears and pikes(because of their <em>pitchforks</em>,  not to mention axes,  which were one of the most common medieval weapons regardless of what Hollywood will tell you.
<p></p>This is,  of course,  completely setting aside how absurdly strong they are naturally. Armour is effectively useless against you when you can drag a house. Even AJ's basic kicks would be enough to seriously damaged armour,  and that'll shake you up a fair bit. Add in steel weaponry and their a forced to be reckoned with.
<p></p>Their added strength puts them on at least equal footing with Pegasi,  and any semblance of military strategy that will get them in close quarters with Unicorns makes them a pretty significant threat.

            I didn't interpret that the pegasi were the only ones with a standing army,  I just thought that they were possibly an extension of the fact that a the aggression that seemed to be the norm if Commander Hurricane was in fact meant to be indicative of pegasus culture.

            Just because Pegasi military culture is pervasive doesn't mean the others don't have a military. We also have no idea if the Pegasus military is really more experienced since we don't know when their last battle was.

            @ kegisak
<p></p>Yeah I totally agree.
<p></p>Case in point,  the Warhammer was developed to crack open plate mail...I could easily see a big EP's kick being like an armour cracking hammer hit.
<p></p>To be honest,  it's the Unicorns who are probably the worst off in a war.  How many Unicorns are actually powerful mages?  I reckon they would rely upon magical barriers to keep the enemy back.

            @Seraph I imagine a few of them would quit at chapter 2. Another few would quit around when we start seeing how the mane cast were during the war.
