            <span class="blue">Hey everyone.  I just rewatched the first two episodes.  Gotta say,  they were both a LOT better than I remembered.  I think I can chalk it up to not being in the proper state of mind to accept such a girly show on my first watch.  And I didn't really notice all the little details that make it such a high quality cartoon,  probably because I wasn't paying that much attention.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Probably the most remarkable thing about going all the way back and watching the beginning is that the characters are still so very,  very consistent,  and yet have never gotten boring.  Lots of shows,  you wouldn't even recognize the characters from the first episode,  but with the exception of Twilight all of them act just about the same as they do in the modern episodes.  And even when Twilight does a complete 180 and go from self-imposed-hermitage to outgoing,  highly social person,  she's still very much the same person,  just one whose grown a little.  That being said,  I don't think I've ever liked Twilight as much as in the first episode,  I love those sort of way-to-serious characters that are constantly annoyed by everything around them.  She kind of reminds me of</span> [[Persona4 Naoto]] <span class="blue">actually,  though she was much less awkward.  It was pretty cool for the show to have an anti-social character who isn't shy or awkward,  but who just flat out isn't interested in making friends at all,  you don't see that sort of character very much.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">That being said,  the episode was almost entirely focused on introducing the cast,  with Nightmare Moon barely appearing at all,  a big change from the other 2 double-episodes,  where the villain gets a considerable amount of focus.  I wonder what it would have been like if they'd made it a 3 parter,  and given Moon more focus?  Idk,  they might not have really had enough content to stretch it out that much.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">I liked seeing Twilight's home in Canterlot at the start of the episode,  it looks VERY different from the Canterlot we see in later episodes,  which is more of a big-city deal.  Twilight's home looked more suburban,  with lots of open space and greenery,  it was probably one of the richest parts of the city,  where the properties are much larger and more spread out.  I hope we see an episode where she goes back there someday.  Anyway,  not much else to say,  but the Synctube was pretty fun for the short amount of time I got to be in it,  I hope we keep up the tradition throughout the summer.</span>

            @ Ginger: They're fairly evenly matched. Red Skull manages to beat down Captain America with his own shield at one point. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then he picks up the cube and dies in a flash of light.</span> It seemed kinda anticlimactic to me.

            I don't remember it very well,  I only saw the movie twice and of that entire section of the movie,  it wasn't the most memorable. The Captain's death,  his good bye,  his revival,  all ten times more memorable. All I remember from the fight is that the Red Skull "died" in a way that looks more like he disappeared and can return.

            Hold on,  if the super soldier serum reacts according to your true nature (it made an evil guy into a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monster</a> for example) and that formula was the same formula they used on Blonski in the incredible hulk movie,  then does that mean it started turning him into a monster because he was evil within too?

            @ginger:  It was due to all the pent up emotional baggage Bruce Banner had from having a crappy childhood,  thus the reason why he's able to go back and forth between normal and Hulk forms.

            Nope,  the process for the super soldier serum was lost. What made the Abomination was an attempted recreation with Hulk influences that resulted in what you saw

            I think The Incredible Hulk film is in a different continuity isn't it?
<p></p>But if it was the same serum,  then it makes sense. Loved that Blonski guy. So courageous.
