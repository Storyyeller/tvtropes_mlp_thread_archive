            Applejack's intentions were good,  but she lacked forthought - she seemed surprised to hear that someon else was providing food at the party - the biggest party of the year. It should have occured to her they'd all be well fed already.
<p></p>And Ben,  while some arguments may have been untrue(and I agree with Red,  Nightmare Moon wasn't destroyed by the elements,  Luna was purified. It's an important distinction),  it doesn't take away from the larger issue,  which every person here has stated: it <em>doesn't fit the tone</em>. One of the biggest concers when faust left,  and going into season 2 in general,  is that the show would change. We like it because of how it is,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> world and all.
<p></p>At any rate,  you can't compare Tranformers to this; I've seen exactly one scene and can tell you already that the new Transformers is pretty dark.

            Well,  selling stuff at an event like that might be a little crass,  but her motivation is still better than any of the other ponies,  and it's fairly obvious that they all imagined that the Gala was more of a County Fair type of event,  where setting up a stand like that wouldn't be frowned upon at all.  Chances are that if Applejack would have known how the gala was really going to be,  she might not have thought of doing that.

            I agree on the Applejack Gala thing... but I find it surprising that the other ponies didn't have better reasons to want to go. Fluttershy had an okay reason,  but Pinkie's was pointless (considering her life is already full of parties) and Rarity's and Dash's were completely selfish.
<p></p>What about the option of Twilight giving up HER ticket? Who would be the second pony going?
<p></p>Also,  I think we should avoid talking too much about pony pairings- especially more mature aspects of it. This isn't the best place for it.

            We have to remember that Twilight is fairly new at the whole "friend" thing; she just didn't want to slight anyone.  Even if she thought that Applejack <em>did</em> have the best reason,  she didn't want it to look like favoritism.

            Well yeah,  but she didn't know that at the time. I think that they all heard 'party' and just assumed it would be like one of Pinkie's. Rarity and Twilight were probably the only ones who had any idea what it would have been like - and Twilight is questionable,  considering she didn't ever correct any of her friends.

Pinkie had the least outwardly selfish reason for going other than AJ since she just wanted fun,  and from the outside the gala WOULD seem like it would be a big party. I can't blame Pinkie for making that assumption

            ^I know. =)  I'm not saying Pinkie's reasoning was selfish.  I actually don't think any of the girls' desires were selfish - or if they were,  it was to a healthy degree.  I mean,  expecting to meet and capture a prince isn't really <em>realistic</em>,  but wanting to meet someone at a dance isn't really selfish in and of itself.

            Fair enough,  but you could also say by that logic that Pinkie could (and <em>does</em>) have fun anywhere,  while Dash,  for instance,  would probably not have had a chance to mingle with the Wonderbolts and potentially get her dream job in her normal life.

I'd say it's fairly obvious that AJ had the best (or most selfless) reason for going. It gets a lot harder to narrow down after that. Maybe Fluttershy,  because she NEEDS to go to the gardens to see those specific animals. There's a chance that Blueblood could visit Ponyville sometime and the same goes for the wonderbolts

            Rarity wasn't too selfish,  no(aside from the fact that,  at the time,  it was presented as a schoolgirl crush on a celebrity),  but Dash's sort of was. She ended up being much better about it,  I suppose due to character growth,  bt her initial plan was to inturrupt a performance to show off. Seems pretty selfish to me.

<p></p>My thought is that the problem with those two is not really even so much selfishness as it is <em>delusion</em>.  More than the others,  Rarity and Dash's reasons for wanting to go were rooted in complete fantasy,  believing they'd get a chance to,  and be able to,  personally impress certain specific ponies if they were at the Gala.

            ^Good point.  Selfishness isn't always a bad thing,  and in the situation at the end of "The Ticket Master" - where there were enough tickets for everypony - their reasons for going are perfectly fine.  If they were to have prevented somepony else from going,  whoever it was and whatever reason <em>they</em> had for going,  it would be obtrusively selfish - though again,  only Applejack's reasoning was truly not selfish at all.

            Selfish:  I must have this,  and you can't.
<p></p>None of the ponies were quite like that,  they didn't want to deny any of the others anything.  Nothing wrong with wanting something,  desire is fine.
<p></p>Their desires weren't realistic,  mind you,  but that's a different problem.
<p></p>And sadly,  Rarity's desire is bringing the song Fancy back to my mind.  Brain bleach please.
