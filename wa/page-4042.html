            Getting around to watching this now. Pinkie's song is terrible. Her introduction to Cranky would be enough to earn <em>my</em> dislike at least.
<p></p>Oh,  I am going to hate this episode aren't I? She's currently diving through his stuff messing with things.

            I honestly didn't hate it all that much. Just annoyed by the ending.
<p></p>Ah well... I guess it was a good thing that I went in expecting to hate it. It's like the inverse of getting your hopes too high

            G1 was fairly dark as I recall yes.  I didnt much like Meghan,  I was more interested in the Ponies.  I was horse obsessed for most of my childhood,  which ended after I got thrown while taking lessons when I was about 15.  I was a wuss and wouldnt get back on.
<p></p>Spike was a little lame and annoying in G1 too.
<p></p>Im pretty sure that the pony cartoon aired with something else,  like it shared a 30 minute block with some other cartoon.  Looking it up it was a potato head kids cartoon... bleh and acouple others.  I think some days there wouldnt be ponies at all...

            ^She just wanted to be friends with Cranky,  which apparently translates to being on good terms with them.  She tried too hard,  started annoying him,  and then she turned her crazy Pinkie powers to apologizing and making him feel better.
<p></p>If I had to guess,  she also realized that he was miserable and was trying to cheer him up the only way she knows how (which,  unfortunately,  wasn't what he needed at that moment).

After talking to Twilight and RD,  she realized that she wouldn't be able to make Cranky her friend,  and she was okay with that. She just wanted to apologize,  but ended up being just as stubborn about that as making him her friend (which is why Twilight face-desked,  she knew what would happen).

            @Mio It's just... she seemed to understand "Zany = Bad" around Cranky yet did all that anyway,  if she didn't understand that,  then she wouldn't be apologizing in the first place

            @Fallen: I honestly don't know.  Some of the aspects of the show I really enjoyed,  but there are also some really glaring issues,  so at the moment it looks like it'll end up somewhere in the middle.  It's like it bounces between being really really awesome and really really aggravating.  I mean,  as much as I know that Pinkie was trying to be nice,  there were some points where I went "Come on,  Pinkie,  even <em>you</em> should know better than that".  The scene with the toupee was probably the worst.  I mean,  I know she can be oblivious,  but <em>seriously</em>?
<p></p>@Ginger: Basically,  she realized that that she had hurt him and wanted to make it up to him,  but didn't quite get that her over enthusiasm was what caused the problem in the first place.
