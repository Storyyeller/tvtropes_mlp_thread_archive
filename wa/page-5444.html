            Because Twilight was the one doing the math. RD goofing the math,  yeah I'd believe it,  <em>TWILIGHT</em> goofing simple math like that...nope,  don't buy it.
<p></p>yeah Dash's 1000 WP was over optimistic,  but remember the record WASN'T 999 it was 920,  so when Twi said they should have enough to beat the record she meant they should have at least 921,  not 1001

            No,  it's because I don't think Rainbow Dash made the math. I think she would rely on Twilight to do it since that's something "eggheads" do. And I don't wanna imagine Twilight being wrong about math either.
<p></p>But yeah,  I've made it my headcanon that a few of the pegasi were a little weakened by the flu without being completely sick.

<p></p>I have also now made it headcanon that Twilight calculated for 921 instead of 1000. Then 8 pegasi would indeed make a big difference for 921 so it would be about 15 wing power each... which is... more possible.

            same,  have to work in the morning...hope everything works out with Appplelight. He should be fine it's his first major offense and we've had ponies get un banned from worse then that. plus he's got all of us putting in good words for him.

            Also,  wouldn't flying in circles lower your wingpower?  I'd imagine it would be harder than flying in a straight line.  Not to mention the fact that making the tornado was a prolonged endeavor,  while the measurements were made with whatever the flight equivalent of a sprint is.

            Yeah,  and I think the mod that came in here sounded at the very least a little sympathetic,  so I think it is relatively likely he comes back.
<p></p>So I guess we can conclude one thing about the wingpower thing: it's complicated and a whole variety of different factors played into it.

            Minor point,  but Fillydelphia's wingspeed was 910,  not 920,  so those 8 pegasi would have needed to average 13.75 each to match the record.

            TL;DR I think there are valid in-universe justifications. I.e. RD overestimating the wingpower of the town,  wingpower being reduced by going in circles,  RD giving Twilight faulty figures to work with (Twi isn't a pegasus so she wouldn't be able to tell),  etc.

            I wonder exactly how many pegasi Ponyville has in it. Their combined efforts (with Fluttershy) made it 800 even,  and they were missing eight...does that mean there's around 90 or so?

            I have to admit that I could see Twilight's unfamiliarity with Pegasi-specific sciences causing trouble.  I mean,  there are different types of math,  after all.

            ok one last thing before bed.
<p></p>ok I worked out a way the explain it in verse as long as I don't think to hard.
<p></p>Total wingpower of the tornado isn't additive directly,  working as a group disperses the load,  so it's some weird math equation based on the average WP of all the pegasi in the funnel times number of flyers,  so losing a few of the highest would have a far larger impact then just what there wingpower alone would give. And Fluttershy's seemed additive,  but really at that point they were so close,  ANY little extra would have put them over the edge.
