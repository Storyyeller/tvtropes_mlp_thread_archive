            It's time for another fanfic report!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Dear Thread Manor...
<p></p>Today I have a few of short and not so short one shots,  a couple of normal sized stories,  and a big one at 200k words and going! Lets go form shortest to longest,  hmm?
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/22329/Pinkie-Watches-Paint-Dry">Pinkie Watches Paint Dry<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Pinkie,  after painting her orange room pink,  has an existential crisis.
<p></p>I'm sure you all know about this one. I liked it!
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/2356/A-Million-Things-to-Do">A Million Things to Do<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Pinkie gets a doozy so bad it can only mean one thing- the world is going to end! Now she and Dash have to do everything they can while there's still time!
<p></p>Some Pinkie/Dash friendshipping. Pinkie really is afraid the world is going to end,  just not in that way...a nice mix of sad and happy.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/30760/Her-Weight-in-Affection">Her Weight in Affection<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. SA and Cadance's love blast during the wedding blasted Chrysalis right through the fourth wall into real life. Fortunately,  the queen of the changelings is nothing if not adaptable. Some years later,  under the guise of a human female,  Chrysalis is financially successful and climbing the ladder of corporate America. Unfortunately,  it's true what they say that money can't buy happiness,  and when you literally require love and affection to sustain yourself,  that's kinda a big problem. Can Chrysalis ever find a source of love that would accept her for who she really is?
<p></p>Now,  this was kind of an impulse read for me. This really isn't my kind of story. That being said,  I did still enjoy it. Oh,  and it has fat chrysalis too,  which I think some people around here might enjoy.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/29035/An-Earth-Pony%27s-Guide-to-Magic">An Earth Pony's Guide to Magic<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Star Swirl the Hundred and Forty Seventh is having an existential crisis. She has the same cutie mark as her ancestor,  Star Swirl the Bearded,  one of the greatest spell casters in history. But how can she possibly have the same talent as him when she is an Earth pony? She decides to move to Ponyville to get a new perspective on things.
<p></p>So I finally got around to reading this! I really liked the backdrop of her going to see her psychologist,  but I felt that The Doctor wrapping everything up at the end was kind of a copout. Overall,  it was an OK story.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/30613/Mort-Takes-a-Holiday">Mort Takes a Holiday<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>- in progress. The Pale Pony of Death has not been very happy lately. He is in fact quite miserable. The pony population has exploded the last couple 100 years,  which means the pony death rate has also increased,  and Mort is more busy than ever. He hardly has time to get to know the spirits of the recently deceased before they pass on to the other side,  and stopping by Canterlot to visit his best friends Celestia and Luna is right out of the question. Celestia decides that it's time for him to take a vacation,  and she knows the perfect quaint little town for him to go to,  a place where even Death itself can make some friends! Just so long as nobody finds out who he really is...
<p></p>I really enjoyed this one! Crazy shenanigans as Mort tries to adapt to mortal life and make friends with the girls while keeping his identity a secret. I need to read more comedy type fics...
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/1990/Waking-Nightmares">Waking Nightmares<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>- in progress. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Blu Team</a> finds themselves in Equestria and ponified,  and nopony seems to know why or how. But before anypony can even think of finding a way to get them back to their own world,  strange and terrible things begin happening. Can BLU team and the girls stand up to the evil of the Smooze and it's agent,  the Slender Pony?
<p></p>Here's that really long one. Takes some interesting liberties with canon<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (there's actually 9 elements of harmony!)</span> and creative uses of fanon<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (the various girmdark fics like Cupcakes are evil induced nightmares in an attempt to break the girls)</span>. I'm enjoying it overall,  even if it does get a bit too dark for my tastes at times.

<p></p>Ah. I was afraid of that. It was an attempt to compromise. I felt that I needed to adress the stuff from that chapter and I knew that if I made Star Swirl take to long to make the discovery,  she'd look like an idiot,  which she isn't. I ws trying to make it clear that it was something she was starting to work out on her own and was capable of doing so,  but apparently that was less than clear.
<p></p>That said,  I did find it amusing that you took Star Swirl's morbidness as evidence that I was into vore.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>@Storyyeller: Well,  Blissey at least understood the point of the story.

<p></p>I'm telling you,  that line could have been taken word for word from any number of vore stories.
<p></p>and as for wrapping everything up,  I felt like you could have done the same thing in a single chapter with Twilight. Just have Star go to Twilight being all despondent,  then have her explain everything she's done/learned to Twi(in technical terms,  of course),  Twi makes some offhand comment about Star being really good at explaining magic,  and go from there.

            @Blissey: You misunderstand. I realise that I could have had Star Swirl realise that whenever I wanted and with any trigger a wanted,  but <em>everything else</em> in that chapter needed to happen. And it made the most sense for her realisation to happen then.
<p></p>EDIT: That said,  I do realise that The Doctor,  even this less powerful version of him,  is a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breaker</a>. Which is why I went out of my way to establish that he couldn't help in the sequel (though he was still a useful information source there).

            Strictly speaking their tech tree is primarily pre-Industrial Revolution,  with the lack of heavy Industry and mass production slowing down the adoption of more advanced things. They haven't even gone beyond coal-powered railways,  and while they have things like motorized taffy machines and auto cider presses,  they don't have all the heavy machinery of even the 1800s.
<p></p>Granted,  they have advanced physics and Unicorn-powered pseudo-electronics,  but such things are <em>expensive</em>.

            I'm guessing that for the most part they're on the tip of an industrial revolution,  but some of their technology is incredibly specialized due to ponies basically having free reign of what they want to do. Magic has basically removed the need for industrial agricultre due to a few earth ponies being able to produce vast quantities of food,  so leisure technology hgas sprung up. Same as happens for every civilization - once less people are concerned with survival more cushy things start to appear. In this case it just happens to be cushy tech.

            With the Earth Ponies dominating industry,  manufacturing,  and agriculture,  their machine technology trends towards precision rather than raw power.
<p></p>I mean,  when the workshop full of ponies can work the same load as a large machine,  at some point you might as well hire more ponies.

            yeah,  that's my take,  full scale industrialism just doesn't fit into the general way ponies think. they are very much an agrarian and egalitarian society by nature. and it seems there are very few ponies in want for the basic nessesicites,  which removes one of the major drives to create the more moern stuff that makes getting those easier.
<p></p>Earth Ponies provide plenty of food,  and with Pegasus weather control don't need to come up with high tech ways of avoid inclimate weather,  so most tech is just ways to make ponies lives more fun,  like parade floats,  movie theaters,  etc..
<p></p>also the whole no opposable thumbs kind of limits some of the tech.
<p></p>and as <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> pointed out,  you also have to take into account the differnt abiliteis ponies have over humans,  EP's strength makes need heavy lifting machines or tractors and the like un-needed. Pegasi can fly,  removing the need for large scale air transport beyong balloons,  and the shear versitilty of unicorn magic just opens up so many possibilities without the need for tech.

            I imagine apart from specialty keyboards seen on the typewriters,  earth ponies would prefer woodcuts that could be recycled to moveable type,  while pegasi have advanced aerial signalling and unicorns prefer moveable type because it's precise and easy to use with TK.
<p></p>Funny thing is that with magic mirrors and a simple linking spell plus voice transmission,  you effectively have a videophone,  yet they haven't invented it.

            We know that ponies have at least three writing systems.I like to think that they are basedon the ancestral writing systems of the three tribes. Two of the writing systems are fairly similar though. With one being Latin and the other being really close to Latin. The third uses images,  but is likely still a true alphabet based on repitition of symbols. I suspect that that's the Unicornian system and is mainly used for being fancy in modern times.
