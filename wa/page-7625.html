            that one I'll buy. YES i know you have your issues with it. but seems legit to me from what we know of Twi. My biggest thing i look for in a story is consistency.

            again,  they are ALL useful,  each one has there own ways that they can help,  yes half of them are NOT cut out for fighting at all in any real sense,  IT DOESN"T MATTER! Stop focusing on just the the parts you can twist to being negative. every single one of them has something they bring to the group that makes the whole stonger then the parts.
