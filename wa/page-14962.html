            @ Kegi. Yeah it's an actual book that's just a collection of cover art.
<p></p>And the RD one,  it was just to choppy,  to odd,  and had to much that simply did not stand up when you though about it. The only reason I still really like it is the it simply FELT like an RD story.

            @Kegisak: I felt pretty much the same way about the comics. Fluttershy's is cute,  but I felt like it relied too much on her monologues. If they had had say,  Rarity with her the whole time their would have been a lot more depth to it.  My only real complaint is that like you said,  it felt short; like not much really happened.  When you compare it to all the other micro-series comics,  it just feels like it didn't really cover much; there was little overarching story because it was just one event.  I think it might be because the entire thing literally consists of two scenes; Fluttershy preparing for the contest,  and then the contest itself.  All the others has far more cuts,  which made it seem like it was covering more ground.
<p></p>Also,  if Fluttershy didn't want anyone to know who had made her sculpture,  <em>why did she make it a spitting image of herself?</em>
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">See,  I liked the RD one because even though it was a bit choppy and exaggerated,  it really did something interesting with the setting.  Some of the details were a bit iffy,  but had a more dynamic feel to it than the Twilight or Fluttershy ones.
<p></p>In other news,  made more <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSouls" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a> progress. Got a better weapon,  plinked that stupid boar to death with arrows,  finally found the bonfire in Undead Parish,  found the blacksmith,  and killed the black knight.  I'll probably get owned a bunch of times next time,  but for today I think I did pretty well. I also activated the shortcut between Firelink Shrine and Undead Parish,  which will save me a ton of time.

            I really don't care about the "dynamic feel" it doesn't matter if things are happening if they are things that make no sense.
<p></p>I do agree on the issues with the Fluttershy one.
<p></p>RD's simply had way way to much <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> in it for me to overlook. Really,  story wise,  my favorite is the Twilight one. It was simple,  and yet meaningful and had great characterization. It simply had some rather atrocious issues with the artwork. And while I do like keeping it simple,  it maybe went a BIT to far in that direction.

            I'm still missing the RD comic.  Haven't been able to find it at my comic shop.  Of the one's I've read I'd agree that Rarity's is the best followed by Twilight's.  Anyone know if the AJ or the Pinkie one is next?

            One of my favorite fics. It's not a terribly popular one,  but the fans it does have tend to be pretty loyal. I think it deserves a trope page,  but too lazy to make one.

            So just got done watching <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTerminator" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTerminator">The Terminator</a>. It was pretty cool. It's weird seeing Schwarzenegger so young though. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> I was surprised by how long Reese lasted. His life expectancy dropped to approximately 0 after sex,  and there were several times when it looked like he was dead before he actually died. I also feel sorry for the police chief. I hope he lived. Also,  the post fire bot looked like crude stop motion several times. But I guess it kind of works,  since it's supposed to be a heavily damaged robot.</span>

            @Ace:  So that guy with the Equestria Girls disk says they work at the theater and they just got it in.  Since when do theaters get their movies on blu ray disks?  Is that an actual thing now,  or is this person telling the most obvious lie ever?
