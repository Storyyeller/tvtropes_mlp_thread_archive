<p></p><ul><li>Magic - Twilight is powered by the willpower of her friends. Her desire to protect them makes her more powerful,  that's how arcane magic works
</li><li>Honesty - What's more honest and "down to earth" than the earth itself? (fic's words,  not mine)
</li><li>Loyalty - Loyalty is like the wind in your sails,  when it's at your back then it can push you forward,  but if it's absent then you stop and stagnate. (again,  fic's words)
</li><li>Laughter - Should be obvious
</li><li>Generosity - Again,  should be obvious
</li><li>Kindness - Fluttershy is kind to all animals,  so Orphinim listens to her (since it represents the spirits of all the animals that died in that part of the world)

            @Blue Well,  they haven't really stopped to discuss it,  but my personal guess:
<p></p><ul><li>Opposite of Magic - Starlight is powered by the void,  the completely EMPTY space between universes. She's powered by the complete ABSENSE of others
</li><li> Opposite of Honesty - Shapeshifting is the epitome of decietful
</li><li> Opposite of Loyalty - Her power PINS others down and keeps them from moving,  which is what a lack of loyalty does in the ship analogy.
</li><li> Opposite of Laughter - Her powers are fuelled by fear,  the opposite of laughter. She can only warp reality if it's scary and blood bending is pretty creepy by itself.
</li><li> Opposite of Generosity - She steals powers from others
</li><li> Oposite of kindness - What's crueller than being set on fire? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            <div class="quoteblock">While I'm all for tinkering with software as a hobby,  as a software developer I greatly respect companies desires to keep people from digging too deep into an OS like that. There's a reason that you're not allowed to mess with that stuff,  and it usually comes down to the fact that low-level OS operations are the kind of things that when messed with can completely brick a device. Not only that,  but it opens up easy and impossible to police avenues for piracy. </div>
<p></p>If a consumer bricks the device through modding,  that's their fault. Anyway,  I have no sympathy for Sony,  especially since they removed a feature that they had previously advertised and which people had paid for.
