            Strictly speaking nobody is 'good' with foreign languages except young children and people who have already learned a few of them. Knowing more languages gives you context to understand other languages,  even if they are from a different family. Learning German straight from English can be tricky because it has three genders and lots of conjugation. Learn french first,  which has two genders and mild but consistent conjugation,  and it becomes a bit easier to understand how it all works. In theory. I'm no linguist(Though linguistics <em>are</em> fascinating,  I just don't have the time or money to take a university course on it. Some time in the future maybe).

            From what I've heard,  learning English to a point where native speakers can understand you is relatively easy.  Learning it to a point where you can understand and use all the weird crap native speakers say all the time is much harder.

            One interesting thing I've found is in french,  switching between formal and casual speech is relatively simple. Insofar as I know at least,  the grammar stays the same and all that changes is how you address things - the difference between tu and vous when addressing a person,  for example. IT might be more complicated,  I dunno.
<p></p>Compare to English,  where using formal speech requires most people to completely overhaul their language and grammar...

            English is as ridiculous as it is because it stole from just about everyone,  becoming some kind of insane Frankenstein. If you ask me,  it's kind of a miracle that it even still works at all. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>Also,  learning Chinese (well,  Mandarin,  anyway,  although I imagine the other dialects wouldn't have a much different learning technique) is really tough to do,  at least from English. The characters all involve rote memorization (because let's face it,  they're rather abstract pictograms) and are generally assigned arbitrary sounds and inflections. To help facilitate learning said assigned sounds and inflections,  an intermediate language was developed. The end result of this is to basically learn two languages (on the upside,  the characters are at least consistent in meaning between dialects).

Which,  to be fair,  is a complete overhaul of my vocabulary,  so I guess I agree completely.

            I <em>suck</em> at languages. Afrikaans was my weakest subject for Matric. Then again,  I was good at Zulu when I was learning it. It made actual sense! But my sister says it gets much harder. And French was the first subject I failed. The grammar of Romance languages makes no sense at all to me. And people always say,  "But Afrikaans is so easy! The spelling is phonetical and the grammar is consistent!" Yeah. Right. Except they're unintuitive to me and the letters have different sounds associated with them. So I have to hack up a load of phlegm to pronounce "g" all of a sudden.
<p></p>That said,  I can sometimes pick up bits from conversations in <em>other</em> Germanic languages from my Afrikaans. nd I can have simple conversations in Afrikaans as long as we speak slowly so my brain has time to translate.

            Spanish is sorta easy,  being like three steps away from being 100% phonetic. Doesn't stop it from being massacred every single time I see someone post something online. You think English gets slaughtered often,  you've yet to see a comment section in spanish.

            Hablo. Spanish tends to combine the "I [VERB]" or "You [VERB]" into single words.

            @Kegi Eh,  German's closer to English than French linguistically,  though,  and nouns in it can be a bit difficult,  I think Romance languages are a lot more confusing with verbs,  though my view on that's mostly based on my limited experience with Spanish.
<p></p>And German's mostly phonetic too. English is just weird. :P
