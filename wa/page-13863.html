            @Mio:  I hadn't really finalized a decision on all of them,  but my choices were pretty similar to the Enlong's,  aside from the changes I already noted.  Twi as The Fool,  RD as The Chariot,  AJ as Strength,  and I hadn't really decided on the other three yet.

            Who/what would work for The Hanged Man?
<p></p>...hm.... Celestia is the obvious visual match for The Sun,  but I wonder if Pinkie isn't even more of a match for the card's meaning (though Celestia embodies it nicely as well.)
<p></p>edit: having trouble hinking of a match for Applejack. Was thinking of perhaps Hierophant,  but that fits Twilight a good deal better.

<p></p>@Mio:  Mostly I was just trying to match ponies up with characters from the games.  If I'd actually decided to go through with the idea I would have spent some more time reading about the actual meanings of the cards so I could do a better job fitting the ponies to them.

            Chariot is a popular choice for RD,  huh?
<p></p>I actually came up with a listing a while ago,  and I got Twi as the Heirophant,  Fluttershy as the lovers,  Rarity as The Star,  AJ as The Strength,  RD as The Chariot,  and Pinkie as the Fortune,  I believe. or The Fool. Can't recall. Trixe was The Magician,  though.

            I dunno... if one interprets Fluttershy's timidness as keeping her more aggressive nature in check,  then perhaps - which incidentally is why I chose her for The Lovers,  because of her inherent duality. I think AJ works for the Strength because,  well,  she's the most mentally stable of all the ponies. Moreover she's always kind and gentle,  often even motherly,  despite the fact that that easily the physically strongest out of any of them. To say nothing of the fact that such gentleness comes out of a stubborn and competitive streak a mile wide... I'll give you the imagery bit,  though.

<p></p>Okay,  admittedly,  maybe it's kind of a stretch.
<p></p>Early Twilight feels like a shoo-in for The Hermit. Alternatively,  maybe Zecora?

            Looking at it,  I think you're right in that it could fit either one. They both have elements of its meaning. I sort of thought that Keep Calm and Flutter On was a perfect sort of external example of the sort of thing that Strength means. You know,  compassion and patience reining in wantonness.
<p></p>My issue is that,  whoever goes in Strength,  I don't know where to put the other.
<p></p>Who would be good for the Hanged Man or High Priestess?

            It's hard to think of an example of The Hanged Man happening in any of the episodes,  to be honest. Closest I can think of is Twilight sending Spike to take the Crystal Heart in her stead while she's stuck in Sombra's trap.

            The only other instance that might be considered would be the Applejack-centered segment of the second episode.
<p></p>Or the "leap of faith" in FPK.
<p></p>The issue is that I can't think of a character who is really <em>defined</em> by letting go/accepting the future/etc.
<p></p>It's tempting to think of the artwork alone and have Pinkie swinging from a branc by her... ankle(?) with a silly grin.

            @Enlong:  Well,  with the one's that you can't find a good fit for,  you can always snatch up a background pony and make up a backstory that fits.

            True. I'm sure there's <em>some</em> character out there that can be swung with the Hanged Man.
<p></p>What would be a good fit for Pinkie? The Sun is the first choice that comes to mind,  but I'm sure that people would expect it to be Celestia,  especially since Luna would be my choice for The Moon,  for thematic <em>and</em> meaningful reasons.

<p></p>As story said,  I'm probably not the best person to ask about this,  but I'd say it's not. It's probably supposed to be a translation of "foolish unicorns, " but it comes off more like "fool unicornses, " I think.

            I'm still gonna stick with Pinkie for Fortune - it represents changing fortune,  to go with her big ups and downs,  and there's no denying she's oen to roll with the punches.
<p></p>As for the Hanged Man,  Twilight actually represents it well when she becomes an alicorn. The Hanged man is all about paradoxes,  in particular the ties(Her friends) that set us free(give her the power of an alicorn).
