            Re: Rainbow Dash analysis
<p></p>The bit about Gilda got me thinking. As a filly at Flight Camp,  she seemed to be the kind of person who was perfectly fine with sticking up for someone she probably didn't know very well. And head-on against 3 (probably athletic) boys,  no less.
<p></p>So how did Rainbow Dash go from that to the selfish jerk we see in season 1? My hypothesis is that Gilda was a bad influence on her. During that time that they were close friends in school,  Dash became someone who cared more about glory and accomplishment than about the well-being of others. If her sense of loyalty came into play at all,  it was for the wrong person.
<p></p>I don't know what happened that would make them not stay together. Possibly when RD dropped out of flight school. Anyway,  continuing on the hypothesis,  this would be the time when Dash becomes a little less insensitive. Without Gilda's influence,  Dash starts to shift ever so slightly back to her old (or should I say young?) persona.

            I dunno,  if I had to guess it's more that Dash and Gilda only ever really got to hang out in contexts where their uber-competitive behavior wouldn't be frowned upon so much,  and Dash didn't realize how much of a bitch Gilda was outside of that context. They didn't meet in regular flight camp,  but in that junior speedsters thing,  which is probably specifically <em>for</em> pegasi and other people who are interested in flying competitively.  Gilda's abrasiveness might have been waved off as locker-room style trash talking,  and unlike Dash,  she never turns that attitude <em>off</em>.
<p></p>In fact,  Dash's experience with Gilda might also be a good example of development for her; it might be why in "Wonderbolts Academy" she was able to recognize that Lightning Dust would be a problem despite her athletic ability.

It is certainly odd to think that the same filly who defended Fluttershy would then treeat her how she did in season one (or not,  I always got the impression that they didn't get to know each other until at the earliest their arrival in Ponyville). But yes,  I can easily imagine Gilda being a bad influence on Dash at that stage of their lives.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I think Dash in Season one had the same attitude,  just more mellowed out. Also I got the impression that they interacted in more places then just the Junior Speedsters. I mean,  they would have to have been pretty close for Gilda to fly out to meet her.

I.e. she assumes that since Fluttershy knows her a bit better now she can be a bit more rough in their interactions.  I don't think it's <em>correct</em>,  but I could see RD acting that way.

I think it's the most logical way to explain how the interact throught the series.

            I've thought a lot of that too.
<p></p>My idea is that Rainbow's loyalty to Gilda made her listen to her a bit too much and start taking to heart her claims that those who couldn't keep up with them were losers and not worth their time.
<p></p>The only other friend she had was Fluttershy who grew close after the race.
<p></p>When the glory of doing a Sonic Rainboom wore off,  she went down to look for her. Ever since Rainbow would fly her down after the day's work and helped build a home on the ground for Fluttershy.
<p></p>In a few years time,  Rainbow started hanging with Shy more than Gilda. Jealous,  she followed them down to the cottage and was scaring off Shy's animals to try and show Rainbow how weak and useless she was.
<p></p>It was then after seeing Shy crying that she realized how mean Gilda was and stoped being her friend. Though Rainbow still caried an abrasive side from Gilda's influence.

            So,  I just got back from my birthday party,  and these are the presents I got: A new shirt,  The Two-disc DVD of the first <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Predator" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Predator">Predator</a> movie,  Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla II,  The 1982 <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConanTheBarbarian" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConanTheBarbarian">Conan the Barbarian</a> film,  and the collectors edition of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrincessBride" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a>. All in all,  I'd say it was a pretty neat birthday.
<p></p>Also,  I'm liking this current discussion about Rainbow Dash right now. The Charector Development she's went through recently is one of the reasons why she's one of my favorite ponies {She and Twilight are tied as best ponies IMO},  and it's certainly interesting to see how she's changed so much.

            It's just that I don't think there's any reason why she can't stand up for Fluttershy at Flight Camp while still being self-centered and egotistical. In fact,  that might make her more likely to intervene against bullies.

<p></p>I would think that the opposite would more likely be true then what you are saying. Especially with the self-centered part.

            @Mio: Not necessarily; she might have defended her just because she wanted to play the hero.  It might not have been until later that she realized that it was a good thing to do.  I mean,  in Cutie Mark Chronicles,  she seems way more concerned with proving herself to the bullies than about Fluttershy. I mean,  when she starts the race she doesn't care that Fluttershy gets knocked off the cloud.
