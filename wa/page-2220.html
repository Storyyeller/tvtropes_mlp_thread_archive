There is a fine line.
I see Dashie as a boisterous overachiever. She aims for the top. She trains her ass off in order to be the best. She wants to her glory to be already there when she arrives.
There is nothing fucking wrong with that.
You know what is wrong with the following phrase?:
"I am going to forget about this pony falling to her inevitable death despite being the only one capable of saving her,  for that would mean interrupting my bathing in rays of glory"
Everything. Every single word. Element of loyalty,  everypony.</div>
<p></p>Dash has never exactly been overly representative of the Element of Loyalty. That is to be expected when they gave her a personality that directly contradicts her supposed virtue.
<p></p>Plus it's probably just easier for writers to play up her jerkishness. She is "funnier" that way,  and the gags practically write themselves.
<p></p>I would ask you to  look at MDW again and I think you'll actually find that Merriwether put some nice bits of subtle characterization that makes her more then just a jerk.

            I can agree that Dash's jerkishness was exaggerated a bit excessively in MMDW,  but it wasn't so great so as to be unbelievable.  My complaint about that wasn't so much that Dash got to the point of endangering ponies due to her ego so much as that she got there so <em>quickly</em>.  She jumped off the slippery slope like after the 2nd rescue.
<p></p>As for this episode; we've known since forever that Dash <em>thrives</em> on being the center of attention,  of course she's going to want to be the star of the show.

            My point exactly.  If there would have been some intermediate steps in there,  she wouldn't have seen like such a jerk.  Like they should have inflated her ego slowly rather than going straight to the extreme.

The point here is that <em>she did not</em>. She was too late. She miscalculated. This is the same episode where she chucked a mutant deformed baby down a cliff,  mindya,  and yet this was her greatest failure,  her lowest point of the series. The worst things she had ever done? All in this episode. Disregard citizens @ indulge in boasting.
<p></p>There are lines she never crosses. She didn't prank Fluttershy. She completely disregarded the fliers' competition (an event incredibly important for her) to save Rarity. She stood up to defend some native indians she barely knew anything about,  just because they were wronged,  seeking neither glory nor respect. These kinda things are what makes me appreciate Dashie as a character.

            The episodes biggest issue was pacing,  honestly. They focused too much on the ego-beast,  and not enough on the getting there or the resolution. I just re-watched the episode yesterday,  the moral scene makes me cringe because she literally say,  "Okay,  that makes sense.". Yes dash,  Not being a enourmous dick makes sense.
<p></p>It was decent plot,  but it was paced poorly so it ended up being pretty bad.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">You are remarkably talented at singling out the part of the argument you can counter without regarding the rest. Dash was distracted by the MDW. I say again,  <em>it's not hard to adjust by a few degrees</em>. Had she been <em>focusing</em> she would have easily adjusted to save the mare. And those other moments? Rarity was her friend,  she wasn't getting praised at the time and she was feeling like crap about the competition anyways. She also completely ignored the settlers needs for the natives.
<p></p>Dash is not always a bad pony,  but she does have serious issues. She was being told she could do awesome things,  and she let it go to her head - a lot.She got stupid. All of the other ponies have had their 'worst moment' episodes. AJ had her worst moment episode,  but nobody called the writer bad for going over-the-top. Nor did anybody call it on Sweet and Elite,  or on Lesson Zero,  or on Party of One. Part of the shows big thing is that they will <em>all</em> have their bad moments. They will have moments where things go o their head,  and they get stupid over something small. Dash's was life-endangering by circumstance,  not because of an out-of-character moment.

            @Thefran: Just because she acts like a jerk in this episode hardly means that she's like that <em>all the time</em>; she realized at the end that she had been a jackass.
<p></p>@Mousa: I think that's more because she never thinks before she acts; once she slowed down to think about what she was doing,  she realized it was a bad idea.  If she had gone through with it,  I have no doubt that she would have felt terrible about it afterward.
<p></p>@Kegisak: That was my biggest gripe as well; She goes straight to completely jerkish,  and stays there pretty much the whole episode,  and then suddenly pulls a 180 at the end.

            To be honest I thought the scene before the play was kind of forced. I know what the writer was trying to go for but it felt kind of unnecessary.

            IMO RD's problem is that she's easily blinded by her own ego. She only ever listens to reason after it's been deflated by something (hence why I still think the MMDW scheme was completely justified)

She has a fuckwin sense of timing,  judging from Luna Eclipsed. That's like,  120% of what humour is about. Humour requires intelligence.
