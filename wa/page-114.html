            Well,  there is <em>one</em> flaw that isn't so easily written out of:
<p></p>There aren't enough episodes.
<p></p>I demand more!  And a theatrical movie would be nice as well.  Maybe a role-playing game for the DS or PSP (though I have zero clue what the plotline would possibly be).  And a scale model of Rainbow Dash.  and a crossover with the 1985 series... or not (I'm not really sure how that would work,  since both were effed up but in totally different ways).

            Fans sometimes mention how they'd like a movie,  but I don't see what would make that any better than just a few more regular episodes.
<p></p>Eh. Maybe I just lack vision. I'd watch it,  in any case.

            Don't you know,  movies are awesome.
<p></p>especially when they set the stakes higher....
<p></p>Or yeah,  a few more episodes would probably be nice lol.
<p></p>though,  if you take the first episodes,  and spliced them together,  that's almost like a movie... sort of.

            I thought the first two episodes were some of the weakest. The climax was too cheesy for my taste.
<p></p>I'm just imagining there'd be a similar result with a movie.

            see,  I hear a lot of people saying that,  but I actually like the first two,  more than some of the other early episodes. In fact,  when my friends (begrudgingly) asked me for some episodes to watch,  I recommended the first two (along with 14 and 20),  on the value that they show what the show can be when it wants to be - not quite transformers epic,  but still pretty cool. Yeah,  the ending is cheezy,  but I kinda go with the flow with this show. There are some things that are just going to happen,  so I enjoy them,  rather than fretting over it.

Honestly,  I just can't imagine imagine too many wars going on - at least,  not in the time of Celestia. I've always been of the opinion that Celestia never needed outright tyranny (this is not tangential,  give me a minute here...) because,  well,  she's a goddess. Even if she doesn't naturally have a compelling presence,  it's like that weird calm feeling you get around really old people,  times a thousand. So,  you know,  people would just do what she says,  'cause they didn't see any reason not to. There's a war? Celestia rolls up,  tells the ponies to stop,  get's a peace treaty signed. bam.

            Also,  I think that the reason their respected Elements worked that well is because she's weak to them. Those powers would work against most ponies,  but because they had their Elements of Harmony,  they were able to trounce the traps.

            Speaking of the Nightmare incident...
<p></p>Remember when Twilight was about to fall off a cliff,  and Applejack told her to let go? If Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy were going to catch her anyway,  couldn't they have went to her while she was still holding on?

            If that's the case,  how could Applejack honestly say to Twilight that she'll be safe? The pegasi not getting there in time would have been her death sentence.
<p></p>How it should have gone: Twilight is in a panic,  flailing around while holding on for dear life. Applejack finding it hard to keep a steady grip with all the thrashing,  so she reassures Twilight that "everything's going to be okay" (or "I'm not letting go",  or somesuch),  which is enough to calm her down until backup arrives.

<p></p>It's a relatively simply but fun spot the difference game. Every time you find all the differences in a scene,  the moral of the episode will appear and you get a medal. The interesting part is that it has scenes from ALL the episodes in the current season,  including the finale.
<p></p>Watch for spoilers.

            @edvedd - So the game provides spoilers for the last two episodes? Interesting.
<p></p>As fir Applejack's honesty moment,  I concur it was a but shaky when it came to being believable,  and perhaps what I disliked most is that Applejack didn't outright tell Twilight what would happen. Which she should have,  being the holder of the Spirit of Honesty and all.

            Personally,  I still think that from everything I've seen Rainbow Dash is more honesty (with her repeatedly shown bluntness).
