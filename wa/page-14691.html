            @Dark: Best way to get over that is to just write something.  Doesn't have to be good or anything,  just <em>write</em> to get yourself into that mode.  Once you build up that momentum it'll get easier.
<p></p>Also,  I know I've said this before,  but my headcanon on the different races is that they all have magic,  but it manifests differently due to differing biology:
<p></p><ul><li>Unicorn horns act as focus points (like a built in wand) that allows them to deliberately construct specific spells with pre-determined effects.  However,  this means that in order to do any magic at all,  they have to sufficiently understand it in order to perform it.
<p></p></li><li>Pegasus magic is also active,  but largely subconscious rather than conscious.  The magic manifest through physical contact; any time they move,  they subconsciously shove magic out of their bodies and manipulate any part of the environment that they physically interact with.  I.e. they're able to fly because when they flap their wings,  they're shoving magic into the air that allows them to stay aloft even when it should be physically impossible.
<p></p></li><li>Earth pony magic is pretty much entirely passive. They can't really invoke it on purpose,  but the magic is constantly flowing through their bodies and into their surroundings. The constant flow of magic through their bodies makes them more powerful and also creates a connection to their surroundings that doesn't exist for the other races.
</li></ul>

            Well,  there's the inherent trouble of the dice system - you can have the best plans in the world,  but your at the whims of chance.

            Random question time: For anyone here who thinks that Mlp Fim had a slow start but eventually got good as time went on,  what episode do you think was the turning point in quality for the show? Personally,  I think Dragonshy and Bridle Gossip where both the turning points: The former is a nice combination of Adventure and Humor {And it's also one of my favorite episodes in the series},  and the latter was not only hilarious,  but also around the time that the series stopped being a hit-or-miss thing IMO {There's still misses with other episodes of course,  but they don't happen as much as they use to if you ask me}.

            I fell in love with the show the same way you fall asleep: Slowly,  and then all at once.

            I'm sure I've said this before,  but this scene in Bridle Gossip is pretty much exactly when I became a legit fan of the show:

            Mine was a slow burn. Each episode got a little better and the writing felt more confident as I kept going. But what episode really convinced me was actually Look Before You Sleep. After realizing that the writing and characterization were strong enough that an episode could work with only half the cast,  then I knew it was watching something great.

            I don't think I could put my finger on when exactly I fell in love with the show.  It doesn't help that I watched most of the first season in a weekend,  so it all kind of runs together.
