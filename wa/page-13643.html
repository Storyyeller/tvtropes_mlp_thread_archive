            If you look at it subjectively,  rather than dramaticly,  the villains have actually been getting less destructive if you look at the  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmofEvil" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmofEvil">Sorting Algorithmof Evil</a>. Nightmare Moon was the most powerful in terms of eventual planet-wide destruction of all organic life as having no sun would quickly reduce the planet into a cold lifeless rock. Discord was very evil and wanted to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> and screw with the ponies,  but he very much wanted them alive if only for having them be aware of what's happening. queen chrysalis planned to feed off and probably kill the ponies which is still better than a continuous <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a> from Discord. Sombra was threatening an entire empire,  but he was already a remnant of what he once was and his threat level is obvious wen you consider Celestia didn't even bother to fight him herself the second time but instead brought the Mane Six to handle it. And of course,  Discord's now at least partially redeemed so his villainy has been brought way down.

            That does make me wonder though who would win in a fight if the G1 and G4 casts got in a fight. In terms of raw power,  the G1 cast isn't very powerful especially how limited telleporting is in that continuity. Though there's an advantage in that any unicorn can do it. However,  the Rainbow of Light might actually do a number on the Elements if at full charge.
<p></p>There's also the fact that the G1 cast fight quick and dirty and mostly win out of guile and sneak attacks.
<p></p>In the end it would depend on the situation and seems a bit hard to determine. If it was a one on one fight,  perhaps a little easier.

            Okay,  so someone else just pointed this out on another forum,  and it kinda blew my mind.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8XlorG6n_cI/TT485IuqQAI/AAAAAAAAAaQ/t5C9zdFIzXo/s1600/Twilight+Sparkle.png">This is Twilight's cutie mark,  right?<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small> Well,  not quite. More accurately,  it <em>was</em> her cutie mark. <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/8Grqpvd.jpg">It gained a star after her transformation.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small> Now,  due to a little bit of inconsistent animation,  her old mark shows up a couple times in that scene,  but <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/7BUQA0S.png">it<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/dFklZ2c.png">has<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/GKglfx9.png">six stars<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small> in the various imagery that appeared elsewhere during the episode. Someone had to have drawn a new cutie mark vector for that to even exist,  so it really can't be an accident,  and considering the symbolism present in her original mark,  it's almost certainly significant.
<p></p>So,  speculation time! Most obvious answer is the potential introduction of a new cast member,  but who knows what it could mean in the long run?

<p></p>Didn't one of them say something about how "this is what I've always done"? And I remember Fluttershy saying she didn't know anything about dealign with animals. It did <em>something</em> to their memories.
<p></p>Just not exclusively,  otherwise Twilight would be able to do what she did for them when Discord twisted their memories.

            What if instead of adding a new cast member to the group,  what if it's someone who was already in the show who gets upgraded to the role of "Princess Twilight's personal student"?  I personally would hope that IF something like that happened,  it would be either Sweetie Belle and/or Pumpkin Cake.  Sweetie Belle because she may need help with learning how to use magic at ALL,  considering all she's been able to do so far is let off sparks when excited,  and even Snails can make his horn glow to produce light.  And that would make for some interesting potential interactions between Twilight and Rarity.  On the other hand,  Pumpkin Cake could be a new young prodigy,  like Twilight was,  given the level of magical outbursts she had in Baby Cakes.  Some of that is just me being a big fan of Pumpkin Cake and her brother,  though.
<p></p>Or it could be Princess Skyla,  and Twilight becomes a babysitter Princess like Cadance was.
