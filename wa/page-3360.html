            What if Cranky Doodle Donkey came to town riding on one of the other ponies,  with a feather stuck in his cap and eating macaroni?  To be a joke on the song "Yankee Doodle?"
<p></p>I'm back from my surgery,  which took faster than I thought it would,  but that's just because I only had my longer brain surgeries to go on for a guess.  So far,  I'm recovering fairly well.

            Hm... Deed means either property ownership (which I doubt) or an action performed intentionally. I suppose it could be Pinkie doing good deeds to try and Win over Cranky?
<p></p>Myself,  I'm betting on Cranky being a guy. And I actually really hope that he's just a bit of a loner,  not truly a jerk. With a plot like this I think there's a lot of possibility to pull off a really good <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyBear" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyBear">Grumpy Bear</a> - you know,  show that just because someone might be a bit abrasive doesn't mean that they aren't nice or a good person. After all the initial premise of 'Oh no,  someone doesn't like me" plot is really overdone and I can't say I've ever seen it vary a lot - the writers being who they are it'll still be a good ride,  but I want to see them change it up a bit. You know,  make a moral beyond the obvious 'not everyone has to like you'.
<p></p>@Ginger: Come on,  this is another good opportunity for Pinkie to grow? Plus her amazing song! What's wrong with that (he says,  knowing full and well it's impossible for Pinkie to please Ginger. I swear I will not be able to see you as anything but Cranky after that episode)

            Yes,  it's over,  and luckily the doctor said there wasn't likely to have been any nerve damage,  which was the main thing I was worried about,  given some of the things I read about.  Then again,  those could have been people's experiences from before there was better dental health techniques and technology.
<p></p>Edit:
@Kegisak: Yes,  brain surgeries.  Most of my 15 surgeries in my life have been either putting in the brain fluid shunt,  or else revising or fixing some part of it.  There were 5 in a row when I was 3 (getting an infection in the hospital complicated things that time) and the other 3 were in 2008 (and I had 2 as a baby for the initial shunt installment process).  Thus,  10 out of all 15 have been brain surgeries,  yes.  Making a dental surgery much milder in comparison.  Considering my medical coding studies as well,  I'm pretty much the surgery expert of my immediate family.

            Yes,  its a pun,  but why use the pun? Did Cranky lose the deed to their home,  and that's why they're cranky?
<p></p>It reminds me of a quest in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars The Old Republic</a>,  which had  a quest that also used the "in Deed" pun. Now I'm imaging Cranky as being the ex-CEO of a weapons company that lost everything when the Griffon Empire bombed Canterlot,  and the only way Pinkie can win him over if she finds the deed to his old business/building so he can provide proof of claim to the corrupt senate and start over again...

            I imagine Cranky Doodle being an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of James Cagny's typical film roles.  Largely because of his role in Yankee Doodle Dandy,  the 1942 biopic of George Cohan.  Possibly crossed with Oscar the Grouch,  at least in attitude.  I have no expectation of this being correct,  but think it would be awesome,  frankly.

            <div class="quoteblock">Myself,  I'm betting on Cranky being a guy. And I actually really hope that he's just a bit of a loner,  not truly a jerk. With a plot like this I think there's a lot of possibility to pull off a really good Grumpy Bear - you know,  show that just because someone might be a bit abrasive doesn't mean that they aren't nice or a good person. After all the initial premise of 'Oh no,  someone doesn't like me" plot is really overdone and I can't say I've ever seen it vary a lot - the writers being who they are it'll still be a good ride,  but I want to see them change it up a bit. You know,  make a moral beyond the obvious 'not everyone has to like you'.</div>
<p></p>I really hope that this is the case too.  Remember how Twilight used to be?  Something similar to that...he's a nice Donkey...he's just got a <em>really</em> different idea from Pinkie of what consistutes as fun.  He dosn't even have to <em>dislike</em> Pinkie...he just dosn't enjoy her company.

            @kegisak:  A possible subversion could be that whenever we see Cranky Doodle onscreen with Pinkie Pie,  he acts like an abrasive jerk to her,  and those are the ONLY time we see him until the end,  where Pinkie Pie bursts in on him again,  only to find that he's actually a very nice guy and polite to others,  possibly even sociable to everyone EXCEPT PP.  In fact its revealed that he actually <em>hates</em> people who are always up in his face,  no matter the intentions,  which was Pinkie was doing to him the entire episode.

            @kegi Yeah,  but it depends on how it's done. If PARTYING is the solution to the episode's problem,  or if Pinkie doesn't get called out for her shit,  then I'm gonna be pissed as all fuck
