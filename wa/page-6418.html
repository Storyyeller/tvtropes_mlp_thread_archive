            Let's put it this way,  Orion: You're cool when you're just hanging out,  but lean too much on the sockpuppetry and it gets wearisome. Let's be honest,  You're on here more than your 'handler' anyways,  so I get the feeling you were just making an attempt to change accounts.

            @Steve: I'm honestly warming up the ship a bit more. they have a potentially cute dynamic,  at least. I doubt it would last in a full relationship,  but you never know. Twilight might find a sport she enjoys,  and then they could share each other's hobbies. It'd have to be something technical,  though... martial arts,  maybe? Judo?

            If Twilight would ever get involved in a sport it would probably be something like golf that doesn't require a lot of physical endurance; much more focused on precision.
<p></p>Also,  my favorite mane 6 pairing is probably Twilight/Applejack.  I have no idea why; I just find it incredibly adorable for some reason.

            Mm,  that is a good point. But Dash would never go for Golf,  that's why I suggested a martial art. they're not very intensive right off the start,  and you build up your endurance slowly and naturally. Plus many of them - particularly the grappling arts like Judo and Aikido - are extremely precise and technical over raw strength. There are reasons why I've been tossed around the room by guys half my size.
<p></p>My favourite mane 6 ship would probably be... either Pinkie Twi for the sheer absurdity of it,  or Rarishy. they just <em>work</em> together for me. I guess it helps that they're already friends,  but Rarity strikes me as being a caring lover to Shy,  and,  well... I don't know,  they just work.

            The problem with golf is that it's primarily a unicorn sport. It's not nearly as easy to hold a club without magic. So I don't see how Rainbow Dash could get invested.

            I can also see her doing more long-distance running versus what I imagine RD does- sprinting and stunts. We already knows that she knows how to pace herself and that is the #1 skill for knowing how to run marathons.
<p></p>Rarishy works,  and I think y'all already know I ship Appledash.
