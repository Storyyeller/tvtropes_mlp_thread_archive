            On the topic of Mother's Day,  I'm going to give my mom some dark chocolate for her present since she really likes it.  However,  I'd probably actually celebrate it on Saturday since we're going to my cousins' college graduation party on Sunday (so I will be away from the Internet that day and will probably do some catching up with the thread that night and Monday).
<p></p>I wonder if Equestria has any holidays that are equivalent to our Mother's Day or Father's Day.  If they do,  it could be a good chance to show some more about the Mane Cast's parents in the show.

            The more I remember about the plot the more it pisses me off.  So the whole series was about various parties getting into fights because the universe was ending,  while the main kids just sort of stumble around,  then the whole thing is somehow fixed due to underage sex.  What?

            Yeah,  the whole sex scene just made me go "what?"
<p></p>You know what I thought was the <em>funniest</em> part of the story? The part where there's that church-hired hitman that's going after Lyra (bonus points cause these hitmen spend their entire lives "repenting" for their future sin of murdering someone) and we're following his train of thought about what he's gonna do with the Mulefa and convert them to the church and have them give up their wheels as evil or satanic or something.

            If it's just like some hinted gag I think I could stomach it.
