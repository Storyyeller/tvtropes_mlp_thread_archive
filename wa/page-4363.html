            About the Daring Do game: I've avoided talking about this since I figured we were speaking about a game which could hypothetically actually be developed by a team of amateurs with no money,  but to me the best way to make the game would be to focus on two types of gameplay: outside free-form flight,  and claustrophobic trap-filled dungeons.
<p></p>It would work like this: you start each area outside,  in a massive 3d environment,  with only an incredibly vague map showing you a series of landmarks and your eventual destination,  the ancient-temple-of-the-day.  At which point you are given full freedom to fly around at top speed and go look for the proper landmarks.  Environments should be nicely varied,  with occasional flying enemies you have to shake off by performing aerial maneuvers through tight areas,  such as flying in and out of a jungle canopy,  avoiding attacks from hanging snakes and such.  The enjoyment of these sequences would be mostly about exploration,  similar to the experience in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowOfTheColossus" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowOfTheColossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> when you were just riding around looking for the next boss fight or searching for lizards.  To make these sequences fun,  you'd have to really work out a set of fun and intuitive flight controls.  In addition to looking for landmarks,  there could be other little collectible things (lesser archeological treasures perhaps) to find,  purely optional,  but to give you a reason to keep flying around.
<p></p>Once you actually find the local temple,  gameplay shifts focus.  Now that you are inside in a narrow environment,  flight is no longer all that useful.  Switching to 2D at this point seems like a good idea to me.  You run or fly (alternating between the two as necessary) through a series of trap gauntlets to reach the final reward,  at which point you have a confrontation with the villain and then move on to the next location.
<p></p>Now obviously this is a very formulaic idea,  but with a little variation here and there I think it could be turned into something pretty nice.

            @Storyyeller: I don't see how you could really do that.  If its 2D,  then you have two options: go left or right.  If your right,  good job,  you found the temple,  no need to explore.  If your wrong,  well,  now you know exactly where they other place is.  I know games like Castlevania (Light Phaser says YAY!) and Metroid can do very good open world exploration in 2D,  but that only works because they are in inside environments that allow you to explore vertically <em>and</em> horizontally,  creating a lot more space.  If you're in an outside environment,  the only thing up is sky.  Sure you could have Daring explore the clouds,  but these are supposed to be long lost temples hidden in distant locals,  the only things that would be in the clouds are more clouds.  And you could go underground,  but then you'd just be jumping straight into the claustrophobic inner environments but without all the traps that make it fun.
<p></p>@Light Phaser:  I think Daring is more of a pacifist than Indiana,  so that's why she doesn't carry a weapon.  It fits into the world of MLP more that way.
<p></p>@Storyyeller again: She could totally throw her hat though,  to distract enemies and pull switches from a distance.

            Yeah,  3D isn't exactly feasible. 2D open world is definitely doable,  though. In fact,  what if the sky itself were the hub? You fly up into the air,  and travel around,  with the horizon in the background being an indicator of where you'll end up when you fly back down. It would be like the sky in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkywardSword" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkywardSword">Skyward Sword</a>,  except less boring and easier to transition to.

            Actually,  a temple hidden in the clouds could be a really cool location.  There could be a very large cloud formation that sort of floats from place to place,  and is stormy enough that most pegasi don't want to risk flying into it.

            @Perpetual Lurker: That could work... except you kinda cant control where you're looking in 2D.  It'd pretty much just be you leaping off and flying in a random direction,  as opposed to a 3D game where you can look all around you,  catch glimpses of far off scenery,  pick out the one that looks the most interesting,  and then fly off to go check it out.
<p></p>But as I said,  such a game isn't really feasible for anyone to make without a considerable amount of money behind them,  so I guess it's just a dream.
<p></p>@Crowlover: yeah,  a cloud temple would be cool,  but you could only do it once.

That way you can have a 2D level,  but finding the temple is harder than just "go right until you find it."

            Yeah,  2D by no means has to be linear. As for indicators of where you are in the sky,  that's as simple as looking at the background or simply flying to the ground for a little bit for a closer look if you need to.
