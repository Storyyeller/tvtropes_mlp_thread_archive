            To elaborate on this:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">some well intentioned or trobled anti villain cause more sympatii in audiance than some shallow,  boring jerkass</div>
<p></p>This is kind of my philosophy.  Usually the real villains are villains for a <em>reason</em>.  It may or may not be a <em>good</em> reason,  but it's generally a reason.  Like Nightmare Moon; she watched the <em>whole world</em> shun her creation,  the very purpose of her existence,  so she went all Fluttershy on the world. <span class="white">Y'know,  "YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME!"</span>  When you can understand <em>why</em> the villain is evil,  even put yourself in their horseshoes,  that makes it easier to want their redemption.
<p></p>Meanwhile jerks are generally jerks because... they're jerks.  They don't really have much of a reason for being jerks,  or at least one that's ever explored,  except maybe that they like being jerks.  That's what Gilda is like,  to a <em>slightly</em> lesser extent that's what Trixie is like.  That's why I don't like Gilda,  and that's why some people don't think those kinds of characters are worth redeeming.
<p></p>...but has anyone actually said they don't want to see Gilda or Trixie redeemed?
<p></p>...also I move that we find some synonyms for "redeem" because it's starting to look less like a word.

That was Luna,   she was the one whoof work wasn appreciated. She become Nigtmare Moon after that.
<p></p>And Trixie could return because she was entertaing character ,  and she don't need much redemtion because she wasn't that jerk like Gilda.

            Okay,  here's something I've been wondering about for awhile.  Whats up with Scootaloo's wings.  Are they stunted or something?  Because they seem a lot smaller than other filly pegasus wings.
<p></p>I'm assuming she's about the same age as Applebloom.  Appljack said she was even smaller than Applebloom when she got her cutie mark,  which happened at the same time Rainbow Dash got hers,  and at that age RD was already a good enough flyer to do a sonic rainboom.  So why can't Scoots fly yet?

            RD also seemed to grow up in Cloudsdale as well - a place where one would learn to fly by necessity. Of course,  it may simply be that RD was there for a Summer flight camp,  or something - I think she mentioned that in the episode - and Scoots just hasn't gone yet,  for whatever reason - wasn't quite old enough the last time it rolled around,  the show sort of glanced over summer and we never realized it,  those sorts of things.
<p></p>Maybe that can be an episode in Season 2,  where Scoots goes away to flight camp and Sweetie Bell and Applebloom miss her.

<p></p>I... I just don't understand why people consider Gilda a jerk. I mean,  yeah I know why,  but... I actually shed a genuine tear reading these comments. So much hatred. How can someone WANT a character to remain a jerk. If you hate them because they're a jerk. Wouldn't you want them converted so they could stop being a jerk? There's no downside to it
<p></p>Plus,  we don't know that Gilda is shallow. In fact she's probably one of the most human characters in the show. She just wanted to have a good relationship with RD,  and was paranoid that her other friends would get in the way. She didn't will any real harm on anyone (at least not much more than Pinkie did,  who was also pranking people <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheLulz" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheLulz">For the Lulz</a>.  She was prideful sure,  and that was the only reason she didn't repent in the end.
<p></p>Or maybe i'm just speculating too much hmmm...

            <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Some pegasus fillies are simply better at flying than others.  Fluttershy is at least the same age as Rainbow Dash (if not older),  and she <em>still</em> has trouble keeping her wings from locking up under stress.  And I'm pretty sure that <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word Of God</a> has it that she can't fly,  but uses her wings to propel herself on the scooter.
<p></p>As far as the whole "major antagonist" vs "minor antagonist" being "redeemed" via <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>,  I think the main difference is one of scale; Gilda and Trixie don't really have far to go before becoming non-jerks.  On the other hand,  Nightmare Moon was evil,  and turning her good required some sort of epic event,  the type of which makes a good story.
<p></p>I think it's also important to note the difference between "Antagonist" and "Villain".  An antagonist is simply anyone who opposes the mane cast.  A villains implies more actual evil and malice.  Trixie and Gilda are antagonists; their primary purpose is to create conflict with the protagonists,  and once that conflict is resolved,  there isn't much point in keeping them around to turn good because there's less potential for an interesting story there.  I'm not saying that it wouldn't be possible,  but that they were designed with that in mind,  so there's no reason that the writers would keep them around after they've served their purpose.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I think the reason people think Gilda is a jerk is simply because that's how she's portrayed in the show.  She repeatedly acts like a bitch to Pinkie Pie,  steals from people,  scares Granny Smith,  and makes Fluttershy cry.  And the most obvious way to explain her behavior is simply selfishness; she likes hanging around with Rainbow Dash and doesn't want any of RD's friends to get in the way.  There may be more to her character,  but we don't see any of that in the episode; any of the speculation about "Rainbow Dash was the only nice pony at flight camp" or "Gilda's just lonely" is just that: speculation.  It might be true,  but there's no reason to assume it when discussing the character.
<p></p>And I don't think that people don't <em>want</em> to see Gilda turn good,  it's simply that there's no reason for that to happen based on what we see in the episode.  The only real reason I can think of is that it makes for a more useful moral at the end of the episode,  namely that people won't always become your friends because you're nice to them.

<p></p>That'd be a fun idea for an episode,  with an out of town team and a sports contest.  No cracking the whip I imagine.
