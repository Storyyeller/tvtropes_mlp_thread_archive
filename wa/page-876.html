            I do think the ending was a little rushed. Maybe they could have cut down on the fight scene in the library or something to make room. But I'm also not the target audience. I wonder what the target audience in general think of the show,  because their opinions matter the most.

            I didn't mind that the episode was predictable.
<p></p>If you want complicated,  twisty plots,  DON'T WATCH CHILDREN'S CARTOONS!
<p></p>And I don't mean it as "Children's cartoons are inherently bad,  so don't expect anything from them",  just that plot complicatedness isn't the universal parameter of quality for them,  to begin with.
<p></p>Criticizing MLP for it's simple plot,  is like criticizing <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XKCD" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XKCD">XKCD</a> for it's simple art. D'uh! It's a given. That still doesn't mean that the work itself is bad.
<p></p>It's a bit strange,  too,  because from a non-brony's persective,  even the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> episodes were primitive. I've seen people complain that when they gave in to the hype and watched a random episode,  it was all predictable,  and childish. An there I was,  smiling knowingly,  that they just don't get it,  how bronies don't even mind the simplicity as long as it's cute and funny,  and they sound like a lost sci-fi nerd complaining that "<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a> isn't even technologicaly accurate".
<p></p>Compared to that,  it was a shock,  that <em>now</em>,  at one of the <em>more complex</em> episodes,  an adventure episode,  everyone expects even more complexity,  and plot twists,  like it's a mystery story,  or something.

            <div class="quoteblock">Why you are so against Adventure style ? Show work best with combination of adventure and slice of life,  it need lite more balanced in that (more adventures).</div>
<p></p>I said this before,  but I never understood this notion of "balance."  Is Sherlock Holmes unbalanced because every story is a mystery of some sort?  Is James Bond unbalanced because there's not a dozen movies revolving around the stuff he does when he's not off saving the world?  So why the heck are Ponies unbalanced if the majority revolve around slice of life?
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I don't understand why you prefer sline of life so much. Adventure style can have same level of humor and characteristion or even.</div>
<p></p>Your premise here is flawed.  Fiction is a lens through which we see an isolated and magnified part of some people's lives,  usually the parts that are most interesting.  All the things we love about Sherlock Holmes are in him solving mysteries,  which is why we never hear a story which revolves around him running a winery or anything like that—it just wouldn't be interesting.  On the other hand,  Rarity is a character whose (arguably) best showing revolved around her <em>making dresses</em>.  Obviously,  such mundane plots <em>are</em> better for a character like her,  and what logical process would lead someone to conclude that being good with a needle makes her <em>perfect</em> for fighting supervillains?  Exactly.  It kinda works in episodes like Dragonshy which are diplomacy missions though.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">It odd that you prefer Slice of Life and most of fan stuff is more adventure style.</div>
<p></p>Admittedly I've noticed that contradiction too.  But the thing is,  fan stuff is fan stuff.  Fans are free of many constraints that bog down the TV show (they don't have to deal with censors,  they don't have to constrain themselves to a time limit,  and they can make big sweeping epic changes since it doesn't affect the core canon),  so its arguably more acceptable there.

            @Moe Problem is: What <strong>I</strong> like about the show is the world. I love equestria,  and I like seeing it explored. I like to know its past and how it came to be. This kind of mythology can't really be put into the show if it's completely slice of life,  since we're focusing in on the mundane problems of a small community. (not that I don't enjoy that aspect by the way)

<p></p>You have half a point—MLP can be really predictable most of the time.  I honestly wouldn't have minded it so much in "The Return of Harmony"s case if I hadn't had to wait a whole week to see how it turns out.

            Maybe they could just replace the show with a live-action sitcom. Twilight could hilariously balance being a single mom with graduate studies. Rarity could be a cruel diva. Laugh tracks over things that aren't funny. Princess Celestia could be an irate professor who is tired of her student.

            Really,  it comes down to personal preference.  I don't mind the adventure stories that much,  but from what we've seen so far,  it seems that the writers do better <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a>; not that the premiere episodes are <em>bad</em>,  but there's just so much going on that the characterization tends to get a little lost in the rush.

Despite the periphery demographic appeal,  FiM isn't a deep show,  in terms of plotlines.  Why people actually expect it to be is beyond me.

            Y'know,  I'll be really depressed if the show becomes completely Slice of Life based.
<p></p>I NEEEEEED villains. Not that I don't love the mane characters,  but I have to have someone to hate. There needs to be an obstacle standing in the way of the protagonists. Discord was AWESOME at that.

            I'm not pro balance just for sake of it but because show works great in both style and it to little adventure episodes.  I like combination of both,  show is work with both of them.  Just like Scrubs is great comedy and hospital drama (better than other hospital dramas).
<p></p>And don't say that most of fans,  bronies prefer only Slice Of Life,  because there are fans who prefer adventure style and there are people who would become fans if this show had more adventure.
<p></p>I say those will be my fav from season probably until they make something epic to. Pilot eps were my fav until Cutie Mark Chronies.

<p></p>Not to mention that we had villains in FIM before,  even if they were libbies.

            <div class="quoteblock">@Moe Problem is: What I like about the show is the world. I love equestria,  and I like seeing it explored. I like to know its past and how it came to be. This kind of mythology can't really be put into the show if it's completely slice of life,  since we're focusing in on the mundane problems of a small community. (not that I don't enjoy that aspect by the way)</div>
<p></p>I dunno,  I think there's plenty of mythology in the slice-of-life and smaller-scale ("Dragonshy" etc) adventures.  We know Griffons exist,  that the ponies personally control the weather and seasons,  the Everfree Forest is a scary place where things grow on their own,  that ponies get their cutie marks from finding their true calling,  that buzzards really buzz,  that they have salt lick saloons,  and so on and so forth.  Practically all of this was revealed in slice of life episodes.
<p></p>If you were to cut out all the epic adventures,  the only thing you'd really lose is a history that basically amounts to "Celestia and Luna are the most important horses ever."
<p></p>EDIT:  Also,  I'm not against the show having antagonists,  like Trixie or Gilda or whoever,  but I would prefer they lay off introducing godlike characters.  As I said earlier,  Rarity is a dressmaker,  so why should she be fighting Dr. Doom?

            I reiterate,  I'm <strong>not</strong> against episodes like "Dragonshy" or characters such as Trixie or Gilda.  I mainly just think MLP doesn't need <strong>demigod</strong> villains.  These are the ponies,  not the Ninja Turtles or the Avengers.
