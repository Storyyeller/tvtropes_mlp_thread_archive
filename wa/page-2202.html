            How I spent Hearth Warming's Eve:
<p></p>Went to a Science Center at a Mall with some friends. Not the best time I've ever had. Some exhibits were great. (They had a hurricane simulation booth) Others were meh,  some were just broken. I got to play a little Child of Eden on Kinect in the last exhibit. It's alright. Friends and I parted ways slightly after.
<p></p>Went to Kinokuniya bookstore and attended a book signing by Sonny Liew,  the author of <em>Malinky Robot</em>,  a damn fine indie comic from Image Comics. I got a copy of the collection signed,  plus a cool robot sketch. I gave him my deviantart profile. (I said I was interested in art,  heh.) He was also giving away a bunch of prints of his work and some other Asian artists. I got one. It had hot girls with guns.
<p></p><center> The  mall I went to has a LRT (Light Rail Transit- basically a monorail system) stop in the basement. On my way back there I observed bronies in the wild for the first time. They had been attending a comics convention nearby and were heading back. They were decked out in Pins,  T-shirts,  balloons,  the whole nine yards. I struck up a conversation with one guy dressed up as Surprise. Apparently no one recognized his costume. Everyone thought he was an angel with a blonde afro. </center>
<p></p>Said he was a member of the Malaysian Bronies Society and invited me to join their Facebook group. We said our goodbyes; then they rounded the corner and disappeared.
<p></p>Took the train home,  then the bus. It started drizzling slightly. I stuffed my goods under my shirt and made it home relatively dry.
<p></p>Yep,  just about perfect.

            <div class="quoteblock">Okay,  I rewatched that scene,  and I think I agree with Mousa that Rarity's actions went further than bad poker face into deliberately flirting the gem away from him. I still think that she makes up for it in the rest of the episode though. </div>
<p></p>Her actions in the rest of the episode are one of the reasons I think that it was a case of her "forgetting tot urn off her swag",  so to speak. If swiping it was her intent from the beginning,  she wouldn't have been so moved by it. Also,  she's not even <em>that</em> subtle when she's actually trying to charm/beg a favor from someone,  as we've seen in a couple of other episodes.
<p></p>But anyway,  to stop derailing the current line of discussion. Last minute predictions? Discord caused the blizzard. The tribes are inspired partially by Celestia and Luna,  even just by their forms,  to come together. The mane cast end up going through racial tensions of their own as a result of disagreeing over the message of the play.

(She was making BEDROOM eyes at Spike for pete's sake)
<p></p>That,  and I still think it was rude of her to want it in the first place. It's like nicking someone's birthday cake off of them. It's understandable why she'd act that way,  but still rude.
<p></p>edit: I'd be happy if there were NO DEITIES involved in this fiasco at all. It was all the Ponies <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">
