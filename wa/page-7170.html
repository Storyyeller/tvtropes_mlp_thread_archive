<p></p>I could have sworn it applied to all pokemon. I remember once leveling a pokemon so much it wouldn't obey me any more. Also,  if we're still votes,  Ivote for Lesson Zero.

            I started Playing Pokemon in Freshgman year of college,  1997.  I got my first work/study check and used the entire thing to buy a Blue Gameboy and a copy of Pokemon blue.  Im pretty sure this was before they even had color gameboys...
<p></p>Im not sure if I got it exactly when it came out but I bought it right around when it did,  give or take a few months.
