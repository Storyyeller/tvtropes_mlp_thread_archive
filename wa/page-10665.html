As for the sheep,  I don't think we've even seen them at all since Sisterhooves Social,  so you can't say that they have ignored that fact that they're able to speak either.

            Wouldn't a sheep or cow talking be pretty good evidence of sentience anyway? I mean,  if they weren't they wouldn't talk at all.

            All she said was that the pony had been raised by deer and believed that it was a deer and that it attached branches to it's head and that AJ and RD were arguing about what they should do about it.
<p></p>Even the goats clearly have decent intelligence. Better than the already advanced intelligence that most Equestrian animals display. And yeah,  cows have spoken in multiple episodes. Sheep probably would have as well if we saw them more often.

            Because if they are sentient like others we will have  second class citizens in case of cows and slavery in case of sheeps.

            There was that one cow going into Sugarcube Corner. Didn't seem to face any issues,  and it's obvious her money would have been accepted there.

            The only farm animals that we've seen that <em>isn't</em> capable of talking as far as we know are the pigs. They appear to be of average animal intelligence (which is still quite high in Equestria,  mind you).
<p></p>The goats clearly had their own language that Iron Will also spoke. Otherwise the headsets they were wearing would have been pointless.

            We <em>know</em> that sheep and cows are sapient from previous episodes. ou can't pretend that that didn't happen. And who says that the fact that they live on a farm means that they're slaves? Mayb they're perfectly capable of leaving.

            Well,  the ponies don't seem hugely inclined to ask them politely for things. But I don't think it's outright racism or slavery,  just a very old system that nopony bothers to question... yet.

            In my mind,  they're effectively workers. You do what the boss says because you don't want to be fired. Which would mean having to find a new farm.

            Oh,  we're talking about interspecies social relationships again?  I'm with Sereg on this one; the sheep and cows are sapient,  and only end up on farms because it's mutually beneficial for both them and the ponies.  Sheep provide wool,  and the cows provide milk in exchange for food,  shelter,  or protection.  Yeah,  AJ wasn't exactly polite to the sheep,  but by and large they didn't seem to care,  and if one of them said "this farm sucks,  I'm leaving" I seriously doubt AJ would force them to hang around.  Besides,  I tend to view that scene as existing solely for the point of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsMeetTheMeat" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsMeetTheMeat">Let's Meet the Meat</a>-esque joke about how the farm animals are technically sentient and I don't really view it as much of a basis for canon any more than Pinkie growing two extra hooves in "In Friend In Deed" makes her a shapeshifter.

            Hy headcanon on sheep is that they were at the farm to get sheared,  which they can't easily do themselves,  and corralling them is the fastest and most efficient way to get things done,  especially if the sheep are at all similar to their real-life temperament.
