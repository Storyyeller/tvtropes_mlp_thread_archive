            @Kegi: A lot. Eating,  dancing,  more eating,  more dancing... as redundant as that sounds,  the bride and groom pulled no punches. The food was amazing and the dancing was exhausting (not to mention everyone who dance was really good). The ceremony itself was different than your typical christian wedding. There were many rituals from how the bride and groom got on stage,  what they did,  and what the priest said.

            @Colin: Sounds pretty cool,  actually. I've only been to one wedding and it was... sort of boring. IT was my uncle's,  and he's pretty traditionally christian,  not to mention of of those people who's just sort of... nice,  and not much else. So it was all very standard. I hear some can get interesting(My dad told me the story of his friends wedding - his friend is ukranian,  and in their traditions the bride and groom kneel at the alter. Someone had written "Help me" on the groom's shoes).

            Oh,  I'm not bothering with the second game. Might get Infinite when it comes out. If it hasn't already come out,  I dunno,  I haven't been keeping up.
<p></p>EDIT: Derp,  second half,  not second game.

            Oh my God.  Sorry to interrupt guys,  but it's really just hit me now.
<p></p>In a matter of weeks,  I literally will not have any friends left.  They're all leaving,  scattering all over the world,  and I'm stuck here for two more years.  And my good friend of 14 years has turned his back on me.  And soon I'll be out of a job.
