            I can fully sympathize with Rarity in that scene; my room <em>looks</em> horribly messy,  but I know exactly where everything is.  If somebody comes in and moves everything around it can be a huge pain in the butt finding stuff when you need it.

            Oh,  I thought there was some highly technical reason for her anger that I was somehow missing,  since Rarity seemed the most pissed off by this,  when all of Sweetie's other blunders appeared to cause more damage than this one did.

That's something I really liked about this episode,  neither sister was being unreasonable.  It would have been easy to make Rarity a total bitch for the first half of the episode,  but her level of annoyance was really believable.

            She called it her "inspiration room" iirc,  figure it's where she puts random stuff together to see how it works,  and probably had a couple half finished projects sitting there waiting for her to figure out how to make the most out of them. Then Sweetie set her back to square one,  it was just a lucky twist that the way Sweetie organized it gave Rarity an idea.

            I could sympathize with Sweetie's reasoning for cleaning her room up; she was being constantly scolded for making messes,  so she figured she could make Rarity happy by cleaning up an already existing mess. It didn't turn out so well,  but it had pretty decent logic behind it. Perhaps Rarity should have told her that room was supposed to remain messy.....Or at least not have gotten so mad when Sweetie cleaned it.

            So,  finally got to watch the episode!  It was a little bit cliche,  I think,  but definitely enjoyable (dat Rainity).  Tabitha St. Germain solidifies her place as the Queen of Ham,  and we get some interesting new stuff (Dinky's sister,  for instance,  and apparently Carrot Top is Noi's older sister?  Did the colors match up for that filly?).  Overall,  quite an enjoyable episode - though I felt like the cheese factor was dangerously high around the 'apple pie' scene,  and if they had actually gone into a song... well,  I probably still would have enjoyed it,  but I wouldn't be able to drink milk for three days after such a dairy overload. =D
<p></p>Who wrote this episode,  by the way,  and what else did they do?

            I loved the way they handled Rarity's and Sweetie's falling out. It was never one thing but a long chain of small stuff building up,  and you could see rarity getting more and more upset,  but you can tell she knew Sweetie was only trying to help,  and was doing her best to be understanding. really,  once again for such a cliched over used concept,  the xecution was just amazing.
<p></p>Also just realized something,  obviously Rarity's family doesn't live with her,  so that means they just walked into her house early in the morning with out knocking or even seeing if she was awake and started tearing up her kitchen,  I know there family but still,  that's just kind of a douche move.
