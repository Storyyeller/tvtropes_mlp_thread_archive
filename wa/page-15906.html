<p></p>Re: Tangled: Eeeeehehehehehehe I loved Tangled! I'll grant you're probably talking about the hair,  to which I'll say it was certainly unrealistic-looking and moving,  BUT,  everything in that movie had a very sleek,  smooth feel to it(Well,  for the most part,  they did really well on the fabrics),  and the animation was gummy and bouncy enough that a bit of unrealism worked in the movies favour. Overall I just LOVE how fucking EXCITED that movie is about everything.

<p></p>But the original had terrible visuals. If you're going to do B&amp;W at least be consistent with it like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodNightAndGoodLuck" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodNightAndGoodLuck">Good Night, and Good Luck.</a>.

It really depends. Everyone agrees that the premise of the mane six getting turned into dragons (and Spike getting turned into a cow) had potential,  but lots of fans thought that potential was wasted by turning it into a vehicle for bad puns.

            I'll give Tangled the better villain,  but the music is some of Disney's best,  and he was still very entertaining,  not to mention pretty scary.
<p></p>And it had a wonderful reverse of the usual princess and male hero roles.

            One of the interesting things is that they subverted the whole princess thing with Tiana only becomes a princess by accident. There's also the firefly thing but I don't want to spoil that.

            I don't think I'd really put one or the other on top. they're both good,  but for very different reasons. In a way,  they really highlight the differences between 3D and Traditional animation - Princess and the Frog can get away with a lot of stuff because they can deform the models of the characters for wilder moments,  but Tangled has a lot of subtlety in its body language. Story-wise again,  they're both good,  but different. Tangled takes a much more classical approach,  whereas PATF really only has princesses and the like as an afterthought,  it almost feels. They both have good characters,  good villains and fun stories. So I'd call them about even.
