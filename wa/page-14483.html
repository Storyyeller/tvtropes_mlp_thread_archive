            @Midna: Isn't it more that swearing,  per se,  doesn't exist in Japanese?  Granted,  that's just something I read in an Issue of U.S. Shonen Jump when I was 14,  so it could be complete bullshit.

            Huh.  I didn't actually know that.  I'd always wondered why anime and manga was able to get away with dropping swears so often.  I'd sort of assumed the words that translated to swears weren't as offensive over there and they just had other words that were.

            There are some words that translate directly as swears and are inflected and used like them ('kuso' being one),  but others,  yeah,  not so much.  It's not that you'll hear a bunch of pottymouthing in shows like One Piece or something,  but the words aren't feared as some kind of boogeyman like they are over in the US.

            Japanese doesn't really have swear words like most Western languages,  it just has varying levels of politeness. C&Ped from the Mother 3 Legends of Localization site:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Basically,  Japanese doesn’t use “swearing” as we do. Instead,  Japanese consists of multiple politeness levels,  and depending on your social standing between you and the speaker,  your intent,  and such stuff,  you pick from the appropriate politeness level. You talk up to your teachers for example,  while a department head at a company will talk down to his subordinates. There are different levels,  and one of the lowest levels to talk to someone is the closest equivalent to our swearing.
<p></p>A quick example of “eat”. Here are a bunch of different levels of telling someone to eat.
<p></p><ul><li>Omeshiagari kudasaimase
</li><li>Omeshiagatte kudasai
</li><li>Tabete kudasai
</li><li>Tabete kure
</li><li>Tabete
</li><li>Tabero
</li><li>Kue
</li></ul><p></p>The proper word to use depends on who’s talking,  who’s being spoken to,  what their relationship is,  what the intent is,  and other context things. By going against what’s proper,  you can talk rudely,  which is what swearing accomplishes in our language (and other similar languages).
<p></p>Even words like “kuso” have multiple translations,  you could call it the “shit” in one case,  while in other case it could be as harmless as “dang it!”. You’d even hear “kuso” in Pokemon anime I’m sure,  for example. I know I heard it in Beyblade often enough.
<p></p>Because all of this is so subjective,  swearing in translation can vary pretty crazily depending on the translator. Generally,  the more experience,  the better the swearing turns out. That’s why with fan translations (particularly anime and manga) you tend to see tons of swearing in what would seem to be kids’ shows or what have you.
<p></p>Also,  because of all this,  I really doubt the Japanese rating system takes this politeness level stuff into account,  since it occurs everywhere in Japanese entertainment. It’s also not taboo. You don’t want to talk in everyday situations the way they do in entertainment,  but you’re not going to go to hell or get your mouth soaped if you use the wrong level. You’ll just really tick people off or possibly get killed.</div>
<p></p>"Kuso" isn't terribly polite,  but it's nowhere near the most offensive thing you can say either. What it's translated as generally depends on what the general age demographic for the show is,  but "dammit" or "shit",  the latter being the more literal,  is the prevailing translation in fansubs and the like - regardless of whether or not it fits the tone of the series,  as Tomato brought up in the quoted paragraphs (the <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KirbyOfTheStars" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KirbyOfTheStars">Kirby of the Stars</a></em> fansubs translate almost every instance of rude language as "Damn!" or something to that effect; the show is otherwise almost completely child-friendly).

Look at how long those first two are,  its ridiculous.  Fortunately,  most Japanese tend to realize foreigners don't know what the hell they're doing and don't take offense if you just use a generic politeness level somewhere in the middle.

            This is both fascinating,  and incredibly disheartening for anyone who wants to learn the language. Though this makes me wonder what huge chunks of intention and contextual clues pointing to relationships that are lost in translation.
