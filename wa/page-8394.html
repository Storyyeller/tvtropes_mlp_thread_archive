            @Ginger: But you see,  it comes down to the fact that unless Celestia is indisposed,  she can solve any conflict.

            "Love and Tolerance" was really just /b/'s method of mocking haters,  really. Then people took it seriously but it doesn't stop there from being so many schisms in the community... the ponychanners,  the /mlp/ blokes,  the old-timey /co/ people,  the /b/ people,  the Equestria Daily readers,  the commenters on Ponibooru,  the tumblrs...
<p></p>Also,  as for Fallout Equestria,  I say it is massively overrated. The onus is on the story to prove me wrong.

            well a Celestia level foe wold be fine,  as long as the story is about Celestia,  if it's the mane 6 doing it then  there needs to be a good reason for her not to get involved.
<p></p>but yeah try some of the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> fics about her,  most of them are quite good.

            Actually,  the stepping down I MIGHT have been more comfortable with if the fic didn't CALL Celestia weak,  then CONTRIVE more reasons for her to fail.
<p></p>Yes,  they're all justified,  but the sheer number of them coming one after the other without fail feels VERY contrived

<p></p>also ginger,  the "fic" dind't call her weak,  one character said she was "weaker" then Luna..and they were using "weaker" to mean "less able to distense herself from her feelings and love of all her little ponies"
<p></p>also,  yes MLA is amazing.
<p></p>and no it doesn't really have a bad guy,  it's more a character piece about Celestia and Luna and there relationship.

            Well,  in my fic,  Celestia is TRAPPED pretty early on,  but her prior preperations are what allow Twi to escape,  and she still strategizes from within her confinement (like sending secret signals to Shining Armour and cryptically guiding Twi)
<p></p>then she stalls Allspice,  disposing herself for a while while still giving the mane cast more time.
<p></p>Then she pulls a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a>,  but loses to Allspice not because she's overpowered,  but because Spice takes advantage of how much she cares about Spike.
<p></p>I'd say it's possible to create a balance where she isn't single-hoofedly solving the conflict but is still relevant to it.

            Steve: Re: Airing to late in Canada - I believe there's some junk with contracts and whatnot that keep stations from airing stuff until later.  Since the Canadian studio still sells the show to a US company,  Treehouse would have to contract from them,  which probably includes The Hub getting a long period of exclusivity.
<p></p>Ginger: I'd say my fic has a competent villain and Celestia and go into more detail,  but I just don't have the energy.  So let's just assume you'd hate it.
<p></p>Pannic: It's the same issue any fandom has.  The fact that some people in this fandom actually try pretty hard to be nice is admirable.
