            Pretty much still the mane source for everything,  some people kind of upset and not liking it,  thinking it's to elitist or doesn't feature artists they think need more attention etc... but overall still THE site for pony.

            Well,  it's good to know I'm not being too rebellious about making a big-ass blog post about how they've been totally cool people to me regarding my fanfic submission. Wait,  let me copy paste the thing (as linking your own blog would be a bit gauche)
<p></p><em>The people at Equestria Daily are rather cool people</em>
<p></p>I take it that,  whoever might be reading fanfiction about a girly cartoon series must be some kind of 'internet person'.  As an internet person,  you are probably familiar with Duke Nukem Forever,  and you may have heard how some stores accepted ten year old pre-orders,  basically giving the game away for free because they were just that nice. That kind of thing sort of happened to me just now.
<p></p>As you might recall,  back in April,  Dude,  We're Ponies was conditionally approved to be posted. Because I didn't understand what 'conditionally' meant,  and decided to disappear for several months for little reason,  it was never actually posted. Quite a few things happened back then,  most importantly a change in rules for submitting fanfic to ED,  namely the whole "no bronies,  period" rule,  so logically,  I missed a pretty good opportunity back then.
<p></p>Of course,  this kept bugging me. It's like winning the lottery,  go around buying stuff,  only to discover that by the time you try to cash in,  the ticket is no longer valid. So I did what any sensible person would do: reapply with a half-hearted argument about how this story is "technically brony in Equestria,  but...",  with the intend of getting rejected,  so that I could finally move on with my life,  with a new lesson learned about how you can't expect that everything will be as if nothing happened after you get lost for half a year.
<p></p>Of course,  that argument didn't fly,  but I got a very nice reply,  saying that I should be rejected outright,  but because I had already been approved long before the rule change,  they are willing to to send it to the pre-readers "to see if the story is good enough to make an exception."
<p></p>Now,  I'm not getting my hopes up,  and neither should you. They had a very good reason for making that rule in the first place,  and I can only imagine the bitchfest they'd have to deal with if this were to go through,  so the bar must have been raised quite a bit. Unfortunately,  Dude,  We're Ponies is sort of enjoyable,  but it is no My Little Dashie,  no The Best Night Ever,  and sure as hell no Fallout Equestria. They'd be breaking the rules for a rather average fic by their standards,  which I just don't see happening.
<p></p>Still,  I find the fact that they were willing to give it another chance very,  very cool. They are probably already swamped in fics,  plenty of which are probably better than mine,  yet they still take out time and risk some really nasty backlash from their readers,  just because they are nice enough to honour an agreement from April (which might as well be the Jurassic age,  considering that this is the internet we are talking about).
<p></p>With a bit of luck,  I might even get some good constructive criticism out of this.
<p></p>So yeah,  that's all I wanted to say. I'm not really in the loop any more,  so I don't know what people think of ED these days,  but whatever the outcome,  I think they're pretty cool guys/galls.
<p></p>Still working on the next chapter. Current wordcount: 1598.
<p></p>Peace.

            Yeah EQD is still a great site and the poeple running it do try their best,  a lot of the "well they hate X" Or "they won't give X a chance" stuff is poeple upset that their personal favorite isn't bigger or more well known,  and blaming EQD for not helpping to boost them up,  despite how good they might be or any other reasons.
<p></p>The one fairly repeated criticism of EQD I do have to agree with is that they do seem to prefer digital art to the near exclusion of hand-drawn art for the Drawfriend posts. And only post the really really good art not giving ones the try there best but aren't quite god-teir a good deal of praise for their efforts.

            Not sure about now,  but Drawfriend also had issues in the past of playing favourites.  Seth's favourite artists getting 5 pieces of art into a single post or being able to ignore the "no OCs" were the most prominent.

            Well,  one criticism I heard was,  and I quote,  "you can  send a pony shaped shit there and it'll get featured there",  which is kind of the case with anything out of the ordinary like that "all tvs in a mall playing MLP" incident in one of the roundups,  but is otherwise untrue.
<p></p>Others have claimed it's a drama generation machine,  using derpygate as proof. These people have never been to tumblr.
<p></p>There were a few who were <em>infuriated</em> at the latest april fools joke,  being fans of the older gens,  but on a closer look they only served as proof that the MLP fandom has had morons among their ranks ever since the start.
<p></p>Finally,  there are those who sent their fanfics only to get rejected,  and were poor sports about it. It's up to you to judge the validity of their claims.
<p></p>As for me,  although I do like the site,  I'm pretty sure they don't realize how big of a site they have,  and as such are unaware of the power they hold. They are,  however,  quite nice to the fans and users,  without acting like assholes even if the fandom's being stupid,  which is something I personally value a lot.

            Yeah some people just hate it because they think it's to big and has to much power,  or that they abuse that power,  which i really don't see. they shouldn't have to hide their opinion just because some people would rather follow someone elses ideas the have their own. Or the people that sent in what they thought was a masterpiece and got rejected or ignored. And yeah there might be some bias at time towards certain big name already people but that's just cause the site is run by humans,  they don't try and do it,  it just kind of hap-pens without meaning to.

            By and large I'm okay with it,  although I do think that when it comes to art and fanfics it can be biased sometimes.  It's not nearly as bad as a lot of people make it out to be,  but it's there.  The only stuff that really irks me though is when they post stuff that violates the rules just because it's really popular.  Case in point,  chapter 20.5 of FE falls foul of their "no clop" rules,  but got posted anyway just because it's an FE thing.  Again,  extremely minor,  but it still bugs me that they do stuff like that.
<p></p>But in any case the positives of centralizing everything far outweigh the negatives. It's still an incredibly useful site.

            The thing about EQD is that it's a <em>blog</em>. Not a news site,  like say,  <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mlponies.com/">The Round Stable<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Blogs are allowed to be silly,  post what they want,  and have preferences because they're <em>personal</em>. It just happens to be a very popular blog,  which isn't their fault.
