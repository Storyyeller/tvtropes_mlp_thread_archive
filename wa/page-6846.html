            @ blue,  we don't know all the details on that spell,  but most likely one is she has to know EXACTLY where she is versus where he's going. She had no idea where the caverns were other then "Below Canterlot" Like with the Stargate,  you have to have a point of origin before you can get directions. She ported up to the ledge,  so she din' forget she had it,  but that was LOS.

            I have a theory about twilights teleports.
<p></p>There are two variations on the spell,  one is a form of recall and the other is a Line of Sight teleportation spell. The former probably need to be set to a point to teleport to (Like an anchor or something). The latter requires line of sight to the target point and possibly has a (Relatively) short distance. I don't think we see twilight teleporting more than 40-50 meters at once outside of that one time in dragon quest=.

            ginger,  as soon as it gets used a Deus Ex Machina,  or some random asspull,  then we'll be right with you,  but just becuase it violates an arbitrary sense of "power levels" in a non-DBZ type show. Your overreacting,  and yes i KNOW you can't help it,  Celestia knows how well I know feeling like that. But the first step in getting past that (and I know from personal expeireince) is to recognize those thought patterns,  and cut off the bio-rythmic feedback loop they create.

            @ Blue,  WHY That's more of the stuff I've been talking about with them NOT having to show everything,  you don't need every single little detail served up to you on a silver platter. As long as there is a resonable explanation that is not contradicted by any info we've seen,  no reason to hammer it home unless it serves a bigger porpuse then just <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">Viewers Are Morons</a>.

            @Seraph No matter what you say,  watching Twi become SO much better at what she does while everyone else around her is seemingly staying static is NOT a good thing for me.
<p></p>Sorry,  I'm just worried about her friends becoming useless (in any kind of physical altercation)

            @Twi's magic being hax.
<p></p>There has been limitations shown so far. Teleporting tires her out to some degree (If not visible at this point) and the finale does show that a specialist in a form of magic is better than a generalist in all forms of magic,  Then again Shining Armor's Bubble Shield spell is IMBA HAX. I don't think Twilight will be taking on any army's of darkness solo anytime soon.

<p></p>I don't think it's really necessary to explain why teleportation wasn't an option when there are a number of obvious reasons why it might not work.

            Do you know how in some friendship circles there's that one person who forms the nexus of the group? Like you won't fall apart without him,  but he provides sustenance for everyone? That's what I view Twilight.

            ugh,  and yet another feedback trigger. Has it happened? no. is it logical from a doyalists perspective for that to ever happen? no. there fore worrying about it does nothing but trigger a neural-chemical repsonse to heighten anxeity,  which in turn cuase you to be further ssceptible to MORE anxeity in an endless feed-back loop.
<p></p>And i know I'm giving you the rough version,  but it's hard for me to put in words how I figured out ho to break the loop. It taes practice but you an cut these off in the bud if you learn to recognize them early.

            That still doesn't mean that they need to explicitly state that it can't be used for us to infer that she can't use it.  Just because we don't know exactly how it works isn't really a problem.  It's only an issue if we know that it should be usable in that situation.  Heck,  when I saw that scene,  I basically just thought "I guess they're too far underground to teleport".  It's not like teleportation was a blatantly obvious solution that got overlooked.  Not to mention that Twilight isn't exactly in a calm state of mind at that point...
