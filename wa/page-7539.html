            I don't like the sound of it,  but I'll still try it (I'm going to imagine that most things Goldenblood did are just mind control though).

            Before reading PH I didn't wanted to read from similar reasons.  But it's not  that bad. Somber is respectful for KK fic. Goldenblood  is annoying but you can ignore him.  Most changes aren't that big and  Somber fixed issues with Stables or rainder virus.  Stable 90 is screw up of Stable Tec,  Scoot and rest of CMC had no idea of state of that Stable,   <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and it's probably sabotage by somepony who wanted kill possible target of fic <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a></span>

            @Ginger: From what it sounds like,  the issues is that the PH author is basically retconning the canon to make his own characters cooler.  Even FE didn't retcon canon so much as make it an AU.  It would be like if Fallout Equestria revealed that Celestia,  Luna,  Discord,  and Nightmare moon were all just puppets of an OC.

            I just ran a search on the PDF version,  and Hoofington is mentioned six times. The first time is a newspaper article about a dragon attack on Hoofington. Then in a memory orb,  the dissenter pegasi complain about it. It's mentioned by the Applejack Rangers when discussing options to transport Cottage Cheese,  and it's mentioned in DJ-Pon3's broadcast about resistance to the Enclave.
