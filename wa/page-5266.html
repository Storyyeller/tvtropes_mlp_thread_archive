            If I had to sacrifice a CMC episode it would definitely be Hearts and Hooves Day. All of the others I have enjoyed so far.

            I liked Cutie Pox.  Out of the episodes listed,  I'd probably have to say Family Appreciation Day.  Don't get me wrong,  I liked it and hearing about Ponyville's history was cool,  but the mane cast gets almost entirely sidelined.  It was basically that or Hearts and Hooves Day,  but I like H&HD more because it was more amusing and gave Cheerilee more screen time.

            I wish I could tell you anything,  Mousa. What I've seen looks good from my limited technical understanding of art,  but I just don't care for humanizations,  regardless of who does them. It makes me feel rather guilty when you talk about needing feedback and I'm literally incapable of giving any. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">
<p></p>As for the CMC,  I enjoy their presence enough that I don't mind their focus. They get equal billing with the rest of the cast in my book. Quality of the entertainment is far more important to me than equality of cast representation in my book,  and I've been entertained,  so I'm happy.

            Lurker: Within the fandom,  usually there's recruitment posts to get working on these.  EqD's nightly round-ups tend to list them.  Sometimes the game will get its own post too (Pony Emblem was actually in two round-ups before enough people were recruited and enough work done to start getting main posts).

            Re Family Appreciation Day - Actually I thought it was pretty intereting,  to get the story of ponyville's founding and all. If I had to pick one apart from Cutie Pox,  I'd personally ditch Hearts and Hooves <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DAy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DAy">D Ay</a>.

            @Ginger: I don't dislike it,  and it's a good episode,  but I prefer episodes that deal with the mane cast more.  I'm certainly not against giving side characters screen time,  but I don't want that to happen at the expense of everyone else.  If AJ and one or two other ponies would have gotten more screentime it would be one of my top episodes.  The reason I like Sisterhooves Social so much is because I think it pretty much nailed the balance between the mane cast and the minor characters.
