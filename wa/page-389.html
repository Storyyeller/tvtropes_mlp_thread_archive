<p></p>It's just that a major part of my fic revolves around how the elements of harmony work. Like if all but "Magic" are used then the target is imprisoned for a thousand years,  but if All 6 are activated,  the target is purified. I have it so Alicorns can access the power of 5 of them,  but need a group of friends to wield all 6.
<p></p>I just had this idea that Celestia overestimated how many friends Twilight would make,  and hoped that she would only gain the power of 5,  so she can imprison Nightmare Moon again,  rather than purify her and forcing Celestia to share the throne again

<p></p>I can see that working if she didn't know there was any way to purify Nightmare Moon - sort of an 'if I can't have my baby sister back,  then she can stay in the moon forever'.  I know I'm a sap,  but she really does love Luna...

            The way i did it in mine Celestia didn't even know you could purify someone,  and she just couldn't bring herself to banish her sister to the moon AGAIN,  so she laid it on twilights lap...then twilight did the imposible.

<p></p>I'm sorry,  I really am,  I'm just a huge fan of the Evilestia theory. To be fair though,  I'm having it so that Celestia accidentally releases the essense that corrupts Luna,  and decides to exploit the event to the upmost. She really does love her subjects,  and keeping them safe is a top priority for her outside of having them worship her. She's just gotten a bit too used to how things are,  and didn't particularly want a wild card like Luna coming back in who could ruin everything (that and I'm having it so the Elements don't actually destroy the evil in Luna,  just move it somewhere else. Celestia would know this,  and rather have it contained to one person she can keep constant tabs on)

            I don't mind most of the Trollestia stuff,  but when people try to fit it into the show's canon it doesn't really fit.  I mean,  she's mischievous,  but that's as far as it goes.

<p></p>Why don't you keep your mind open to the possibility that ANYTHING can end up being canon? No reason to restrict yourself unless it's COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE. The Trollestia issue I think is vague enough to still be potentially viable

In a Bird in the Hoof,  everyone was being so prim and proper. All she did was break the ice and show that it was <em>okay</em> to loosen up around her.
<p></p>And The Best Night Ever? She spent the entirety of the party greeting guests. Nothing else. Now imaging doing this exact same thing <em>for a thousand years</em>.

<p></p>I find that in a scale of one to ten the idea that the writer are going to have Celestia be a cruel troll or anything of the sort to be very much on the low end of the scale. Thus,  trying to fit it into canon just seems jarring.

But regardless of the depth of characterization,  worldbuilding goodness,  and Lauren Faustitude,  you have to consider the <em>real</em> target audience and,  to perhaps a greater extent,  the series' tone so far.  The brilliant,  beautiful alicorn princess isn't going to turn out to be an oppressive,  power-hungry tyrant.
<p></p>Now,  Trollestia I support.  She's proven that she likes to be mischievous in the past,  to the point of introducing the mane cast to Canterlot's <em>hoi polloi</em> for the sole purpose of shaking them up (if not quite to the extent they ended up,  but...),  after all.
<p></p>Anyway,  I'm gonna take a second to address something tangentially related I've been thinking about for a while.  This isn't directed at you,  Ginger,  your comment just provides a nice jumping-off point.
<p></p>I was at Connecticon over the weekend,  and there was a panel on FiM there that struck me as rather alarmist.  It predicted that the series will eventually fall into a morass of fandom nods and brony trolling because that's what the fanbase wants,  or something similar to that argument,  and that it will eventually lose all its refreshingness and... well,  not really 'innocence',  but... soul,  perhaps.  I have to emphatically disagree.  I won't deny that there are a lot of fans who'd like to see the show with more of an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">edge</a>; but I have to say that I don't understand that <em>at all</em>.  The show's appeal is in its... damn,  again I can't say 'innocence'.  It's clear-eyed,  perhaps,  is what I want to say.  Not cynical at all.  Cynicism goes against a lot of what it stands for (aside from selling toys,  that is,  in a massive ironic blow to my argument),  so if the show does lose its soul,  it'll be in the other direction - sanitized,  not cynicized,  if I'm allowed to be twee.
<p></p>...Moving on.  JTeeth,  answer me honestly: am I a spaz?
