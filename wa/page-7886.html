            <span class="blue">@Story:The bad endings are pretty dark and grim compared to the generally cheerful tone of the game,  and leave the main plot riddled with unsolved questions,  so if you think about it you can guess something's wrong.  The Good Ending is happy and resolves nearly everything,  but there are just a couple more unexplained events lingering.  You really do have to think it through,  realize there's more going on,  and use your own initiative to get the True Ending.  Well,  that or look at a guide.</span>

            @Blue: Wow,  really? When I hear about people grinding,  it's usually up to lvl 99 or some such.
<p></p>But yeah,  it would explain the difference. Yukiko and Cheie are falling behind,  but Kanji's sticking right beside me at lvl 70. Yukiko is just trailing behind by half a level. Which is funny,  because when I first added Kanji to the party he was a few levels behind the rest of us.
<p></p>How do the other characters play? I'd been curious what their major traits were,  if there was one that could pull a healer role or something like that. I sincerely doubt I'll replay the game any time soon,  but when I do I might want to pick up the other party members. Naoto in particular looks <em>astounding</em> in battle.
<p></p>@Giner: The only one I've played was <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalesOfSymphonia" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a>,  and it's villain managed to rule the world by the <em>start</em> of the game. So yeah. Good villains.

            Well,  it's been a while since I've played it,  so I might just be forgetting them. They were definitely evil,  at least. I think he'd probably find Lloyd and maybe Collete obnoxious,  though. <br>I should really play Abyss more. <br> <br>@ Kegi. Teddie's a healer. Naoto's skillset is really situational,  though. She relies a lot on the instant kill moves,  which don't work most of the time.

            Not so sure,  Swas. I have pretty good luck with the insta-kills... I like to call them the win button,  since I can almost always get at least a few enemies with them.
<p></p>Of course their useless against bosses,  but hey.

            <span class="blue">@Kegisak: Chie is a good physical fighter who specializes in crowd control,  while Kanji specializes in single opponent damage (which means he's better for bosses).  Chie also gets some useful passive abilities and damage boosting spells.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Yosuke is the party</span> <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicarpPower" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicarpPower">Magicarp.</a>  <span class="blue">Actually,  he's not <em>bad, </em> but he's nothing special throughout most of the game.  He does decent wind damage,  has some useful buffs and a few bad status spells,  but he's weak phsyically and is only like the 4th best spellcaster.  Until you get his last couple abilities which boost his wind damage up to extremely high amounts (making him probably 2nd only to Yukiko) and grants him a VERY powerful physical attack with a high critical rate.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Yukiko is the best healer AND the best damage mage,  but she's pretty squishy and easily killed.  She also has really high luck,  which means you can use her regular attack for pretty reliable critical hits.  They won't do any damage worth mentioning,  but they knock enemies down so you can do an All Out Attack.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Teddy is 2nd best damage mage (after Yukiko),  2nd best healer,  and has a few useful status things.  He'd basically be an inferior version of Yukiko if it weren't for the fact that he's much more resistant to damage than she is and has some decent physical attack.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Naoto is <em>great</em> for dungeon crawling with instant kill attacks (which can target ALL enemies),  very powerful non-elemental spells,  and multi-hit physical attacks.  But she's not very good for bosses.  Once I got her I used her for every single non-boss battle,  because I liked her so much.</span>

            Well yeah,  but the spells also eat her SP really quickly. I've always been paranoid with normal enemies in case they have reflect dark or something. I would much rather play it safe than take risks like that. Scan and stuff,  blah blah,  but it's just how I prefer to play.

            Yeah... I was recommended at the beginning of playing that I use Kanji and Chei,  because 'you hit things and they die'. It helps that Kanji is easily my favourite character,  and the one I can relate to the most,  plus I like Chie a lot too. The only thing I have an issue with is that I find it hard to fuse persona's with wind attacks,  so that means I'm almost consistently without an element,  which slows me down. Plus Kanji's a useless mage,  meanign that his spells are really only good for enemies weak to lightning.

<p></p>Well for the most part,  they use <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>,  so it sometimes looks like the villians are winning. It's not until the end of the book that you find out what they've really been doing all this time.
