We don't know all of Celestia and Luna's powers,  but we do know that automatic magic cancellation isn't one of them,  so there would by simple logic be spells cast by both parties that didn't connect.

<p></p>C.  Power is neither a requisite to be nor a measure of a god or goddess.  The fact that Celestia and Luna are goddesses doesn't mean anything about their power; it means that they're divine,  and that's all it means.

<p></p>I'm just saying that Harry Potter wizrds would canonically lose a fight with a muggle every time. And then on the other end of the scale you have guys like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrStrange" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrStrange">Dr. Strange</a> who are so ridicuolusly broken it's insane,  but both use magic.

            Regardless,  that's silly and I can't take any fic that sees Celestia's death as causing the retroactive destruction of every star in the universe seriously at all.  I just can't.
<p></p>A. That was a counterspell to a spell that was already being executed; my point is that they wouldn't be able to cancel Sombra's spells the instant they left his horn,  at least not without effort.
<p></p>B. I don't see the relevance.
<p></p>C. 'Easily' is a relative term.  You suggested that Sombra was more powerful that Celestia,  and that only with Luna involved could she defeat him; Sombra knew they were coming,  and there's no way he went without a fight.  Even a one-sided fight leaves marks of a struggle when the less-powerful side can 'pulverize the planet with a thought'.
<p></p>Or the alicorns aren't that powerful.  There's a point where you stop holding back,  and that point is when your opponents are actually starting to be a threat.
<p></p>What's your definition of goddess,  then?  Also,  why aren't they by your definition?

            I think 'godhood' really depends on the context and/or the setting,  a Deity can either be simply a being worshiped or revered by a certain collective of people,  an anthropomorphic personification,  or simple a incredibly powerful entity. Personally I think Celestia may be leaning more to the anthropomorphic personification side: She exists to perform a role,  though she's not necessarily worshiped.

            @Sereg: Potter universe wizards have terrible survival senses and are far less savvy than same-world muggles because of their over-dependance on their declining magics. Discworld (Current) Wizards are powerful in terms of knowledge and prepared spells,  and have the powerful magitech supercomputer HEX to help with the finicky maths behind their spells. Strange is powerful because the brand of magic he wields is close to the world-building forces of creation.
<p></p>Also even Deities have power tiers,  from Small Gods to lesser Kami and Greater Kami,  to Local Gods and then to Pantheon-class,  and all pale to Creator-class.
<p></p>I would say Sombra had the power of a Greater Kami,  and Chrysalis was artificially powered up to Local God because of all the love she was hopped up on. Celestia and Luna are technically Pantheon-class,  Cadance is young and currently a lower-tier Local God,  while Lauren's God-Empress avatar is Creator-class.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_down.png" alt="[down]" title="[down]" height="16" width="16"> fixed. Technically Kami are equal to spirits and less-powerful Gods.

            @Pan: I wouldn't really go that far.  A lot of the reasons I like Celestia relate to the fact that she is a person behind the crown,  and she wants to be seen as something more than her role.  She's definitely very closely tied to the sun,  and similar in presentation sometimes (kind and benevolent,  but with a harsh side as well),  but I don't know if I'd go so far as personification.
<p></p>@Ace: Lesser kami include things like the spirits of individual trees,  so I'm not sure why you'd class Sombra there.

            @Anyone who's read the comic: How long is it? Bout a standard single-issue comic length? IF so,  I imagine I'll probably just wait until the first few issues are collected,  as tends to be how those things go. IF it's a bit longer I might be more willing to go out and grab one.

            <div class="quoteblock">Regardless,  that's silly and I can't take any fic that sees Celestia's death as causing the retroactive destruction of every star in the universe seriously at all. I just can't.</div>
<p></p>Well,  that's stated once in the entire extremely long series. Basicaly there,  Celestia isn't just the goddess of the sun,  she is the very <em>concept</em> of suns. The same is true of all alicorns and draconequii.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> A. That was a counterspell to a spell that was already being executed; my point is that they wouldn't be able to cancel Sombra's spells the instant they left his horn,  at least not without effort.</div>
<p></p>Why not? Celestia easily dispelled Twilight's spell. Who's to say she couldn't dispell Sonbra's the instant his horn started glowing? The more powerful someone is the <em>less</em> effort thy require in fights.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> B. I don't see the relevance. </div>
<p></p>So they don't miss and rearange some continents. Assuming they were going for brute force which they clearly weren't anyway.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">C. 'Easily' is a relative term. You suggested that Sombra was more powerful that Celestia,  and that only with Luna involved could she defeat him;</div>
<p></p>I suggested that he's more powerful than Celestia (which I confess I'm not even sure of),  <em>not</em> that the difference was so big that she needed Luna to stand a chance.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Sombra knew they were coming, </div>
<p></p>Says who? For all we know,  it was an ambush!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> and there's no way he went without a fight. Even a one-sided fight leaves marks of a struggle when the less-powerful side can 'pulverize the planet with a thought'.</div>
<p></p>Um. No. I don't care if you can annihilate the universe. If I can kill you first,  it's irrelevant.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Or the alicorns aren't that powerful. There's a point where you stop holding back,  and that point is when your opponents are actually starting to be a threat.</div>
<p></p>You still aren't taking motives into account here. We <em>know</em> she held back. We can see it from her different strategies and the powers she'd already demonstrated.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> What's your definition of goddess,  then? Also,  why aren't they by your definition? </div>
<p></p>Long and complicated. But the easiest answer to your question is that I don't believe that anypony in-Universe thinks she's a goddess. That's <em>way</em> more than I need for me to decide that they aren't.
<p></p>EDIT: <div class="quoteblock">Personally I think Celestia may be leaning more to the anthropomorphic personification side: She exists to perform a role,  though she's not necessarily worshiped. </div>
<p></p>This is basically what I think. Though not quite at the level of power f some anthropomorphic personifications. The sun is older than her,  she <em>will</em> die and the sun will be just fine until it's taken up by her successor.

            @Red Savant: Oh,  of course she's far more then just a Cosmic Light Switch. I'm just speculating that her original purpose might be that of a Sun-Deity or something similar. It's very... I'm not sure if I have an exact comparison,  but perhaps Death from Discworld would be a good one. He's the GRIM REAPER... And he likes kittens,  and thinks life is amusing.
