            I think it's just the fact that actively searching for cuite marks isn't something that most foals do. They come on their own,  and most don't appear to put much thought towards it until after the fact. The CMC are already pretty late bloomers,  and Babs seemingly even more so (note how much bigger she is than the CMC),  so they're in a bit of a unique position regarding their marks.

<p></p>" I just finished the episode. My thoughts:
<p></p>Confound you Babs,  you drive me to conflicted feelings. On the one hand,  I totally sympathize with your plight back home. And I have no doubt that you are a nice filly overall. But...I cannot find a justification for your actions. And yes...you got off a little bit too easy. But ultimately,  I'm happy with the episode's outcome. Everyone who needed to learn a lesson learnt it,  friendships have been established...and DT and SS got a mud bath. So,  I'm happy.
<p></p>And I'm going to come out and say that I do know exactly what Babs was going through. After I dealt with my bullies,  I swore that I would never be a victim to anybody ever again. From then on,  first time anyone gave me any trouble,  I would respond with overwhelming retribution to knock it in the bud there and then. But I would never start victimizing anyone to draw attention anyway from myself. Unfortunately...my way isn't the best example to teach to kids. Otherwise,  Babs would have battered DT and SS the second they opened their mouths. Ultimately,  the show took a better route in my opinion."
<p></p>Are you me? This is pretty what I was going to say,  and that's also how I dealt with bullies.

            One of my friends on Facebook: "I don't care what my Brony friends have to say,  today's episode was WRONG. I didn't like it. I understand that bullying is a big thing now,  but I felt like the CMC were fully justified in their actions. The only thing about the episode I liked at all was the song,  but I thought the song was too long and used too many repeat frames. I was bullied all my childhood,  but I never pulled shit like Babs did. I'm sorry,  I don't like her,  and I hope she NEVER appears on the show again.
<p></p>"The episode for me was,  in short,  disappointing. To put it in brony-speak,  Babs is worst pony."
<p></p>Her husband: "Yeah,  nothing excuses Babs' behavior. It was a terrible,  TERRIBLE episode,  and this season is really taking the show downhill. Time for the fad to die out,  if this keeps up."

            Right,  so Babs was terrible for being mean in response to bullying,  so the CMC were completely justified for being mean in response to bullying?
<p></p>Either way,  they're missing the point that Babs <em>was</em> in the wrong. The point of the episode is that,  yeah,  doing what she did <em>wasn't</em> the right thing to do.

            @Pannic: Nope. I thought it was very well handled,  and I was bullied pretty thoroughly for two-thirds of my time in school.

            I went down a similar route as Babs. Got sick being bullied in Compton and went to a different school. Was a complete jerkass at that point. However my future friends from their never lashed back. They showed me genuine friendship,  and I still thank them for it.
<p></p>So yeah. I like this episode's moral.
