            <div class="quoteblock">On Saturday,  the pumps at my station went down. I got them up and running again eventually (computers,  bah) and most people were understanding...except for one little drip who was acting as though it was my personal fault and was throwing little condescending remarks at me,  glaring at me etc.
<p></p>Well guess who just arrived on my doorstep hoping to sell me a Virgin TV,  Phone and Broadband package. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16"></div>
<p></p>Back around 1992,  my mom and I were driving home from the shopping mall one town over.  Some guy kept pulling up beside us and giving us the finger for no apparent reason.  I memorized his smug face.
<p></p>Fast-forward some months.  I'm walking my dog a block away from my home.  Who crosses the street in front of me to get his mail?  Eeyup.
<p></p>The next winter,  his mailbox got irreparably crushed during a blizzard.  Must have been one of those careless snow plow drivers.  Bastards.

            Oh,  we're going on about sleep troubles and how we look in real life?  I'm about 5' 10",  not fat but could stand to lose a few pounds,  have a short beard,  and my head appears to have grown through my hair.  Also I wear glasses.
<p></p>As for sleeping,  ever since I was a kid it's always taken me <em>forever</em> to fall asleep because as soon as I get in bed my brain goes "have ALL the thoughts!" which means that I usually lie in bed for an hour or so before falling asleep.  And that's if the rest of my body doesn't decide to troll me by making it feel like I have to go the bathroom only for it go away when I actually bother to get out of bed.

            @J Teeth,  I had the exact same issue when I was a kid about sleeping,  though ALL THE THOUGHTS tended to be "What if the world ended in my sleep? Would I know it?"

            I'm curious to find out if it was a theoretical spell Starswirl had written without casting it since it was one-use only. It sure sound like a spell that exploits a loophole in the nature of time.
