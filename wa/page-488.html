            @Ginger Well,  Pinkie only set up the one prank,  IIRC,  since Dashie confessed to setting up all the other ones once Gilda had a freakout.  So it's kind of like Dashie accidently sabotaged Pinkie's attempt to befriend Gilda through party.  Granted,  Gilda didn't seem to be too impressed with the party even before the pranks began,  so Pinkie's idea might have been doomed from the start.
<p></p>Finished up a <a class="urllink" href="http://no-contest-creations.com/2011/07/28/mlp-fim-start-of-nightmare-part-09/">new comic page<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> where I didn't pick on Twilight.  Yay.
<p></p>Edit: Well,  I'm dumb.  I must've been pretty tired because I forgot Dashie's wings.  *head desk* Gonna have to fix that tonight.

            Just to clarify,  sockpuppets <em>per se</em> aren't my issue. I just don't like this thread being filled up with "ponies posting on TV Tropes via some internet connection to Equestria" and stuff like that.
<p></p>And am I really the only one bugged by this?

            About Gilda.
<p></p>I don't really whant her to return and espacialy her redemption.
I don't even see that would fit her character,  she does't show any sign that she would whanted to redim herself in the eyes of those "lame" ponies.
<p></p>And ponies needing to "redim" them self in eyes of Gilda? What?
<p></p>Only plot with Gilda what would to see is episode when RD tries to fix her relations with Gilda to only see how huge jerk that griffon is. Something opposite to redemption.
<p></p>I don't know why so many fans whant to see her back,   she is bad influence of Rainbow Dash.
<p></p>I really whant see more griffins,  more deep and nicer that Gilda.

It's just watching the journey of a bad person becoming good,  there's something really heartwarming and optimistic about it. The only redemption we've seen so far is Luna's,  and that was via magic.
<p></p>Oh and I thought Gilda showed a bit of remorse right before she stormed out of the party. Despite claiming that RD was suddenly lame,  she was still making a conscious effort trying not to say anything too mean to her,  and it seemed that she got defensive at the party because everyone was looking at her. She just got embarrassed

I hope they make s2 bad guy who later will try redem him/herself. Episode about this for Luna also could be fine.  She propably feel responsible for everythign what she done as Nightmare Moon (we don't know  how many or how much bad thing she done).

            I'm kinda hoping the villain will be rather nasty,  like an old wizard who was trapped for a long time,  or ancient king from long ago or something. Not the nice kind of villain who is eventually a shoo-in for redemption,  but a villain who is going to stay a villain - and a threat - for the show's run.

            My opinion on sock puppets: they're okay if you just use them for fun,  but NOT if you use them in arguments (that's cheating),  if you use them to spam and sneak around bans,  or if you RP when it is not accepted by the group (go somewhere else instead if that happens).
<p></p>My opinion on Gilda and redemption: Possible. I think the mane cast would have to apologize to Gilda for the pranking thing,  but Gilda would also need to make serious efforts to tolerate the ponies and accept that she can't have Dash all to herself.
<p></p>What would happen if Gilda met Scootaloo?

            RE: Sockpuppets: I don't mind it too much; although it kinda gets annoying when there are like ten different ones posting all at once.  Having like one or two show up to interact with forum members is fine by me.  But when there are a bunch of them all interacting with each other,  it's something that should probably go in a dedicated thread,  because it basically kills all other discussion.  Essentially,  I have no qualms if a Twilight or Rainbow Dash pops up occasionally and interacts with the forum members (so the Scootaloo post above is totally fine),  but if the rest of the Mane Cast shows up and starts talking about in-universe stuff with each other,  it should go somewhere else,  because that's really more of an RP than sockpuppeting.
<p></p>Also,  I really want to see Steven Magnet return in Season 2,  with bonus points if he shows up out of nowhere to help the ponies in return for helping him with his mustache.  It would be an awesome <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>.
