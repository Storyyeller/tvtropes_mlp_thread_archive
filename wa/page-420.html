            I'm sorry,  but I've been brought up to respect the old. They're <em>old</em>,  they must be doing something right. Doing that to Granny just for a laugh severely rubs me the wrong way.

            ^Exactly.  Pranking her was Not Cool,  but it doesn't make her pure evil with no hope of redemption.  If she ever swallows her pride enough to come back to Ponyville and apologize,  I'm sure she could be friends with at least some of the mane six.  I imagine Rarity would have great fun designing outfits for a gryphon.

            The thing that bugs me most about Gilda is that she's more malicious.  Blueblood was a jackass,  but he didn't go out of his way to annoy anyone.  Trixie was a little worse in that regard by picking fights with people,  but even then she just provoked them into a confrontation rather than just attacking.
<p></p>Gilda <em>knows</em> she's being a jerk and doesn't care as long as it doesn't affect her negatively.  I get the feeling that the only reasons she's friends with Dash is because the latter probably compliments her flight skill or something.

            @Ginger,  regarding Fluttershy and Gilda: Oh,  definitely.  That would be pretty dang cathartic to watch.
<p></p>Yeah.  Like I said,  Dash's big mistake was challenging Gilda in front of so many people.  Gilda's even more proud than Dash is,  and she couldn't have backed down or admitted she was wrong - like she might have in private - in front of an audience.  So she blew up instead.

            She's smart enough,  but she's also all about her reputation,  soI don't think she'd do anything that would make her look bad.  Not to mention that she's a terrible liar,  and that seems too indirect for her.

            I can see a Gilda redemption episode having a similar plot as Winter Wrap Up. However,  rather than having Gilda fit in,  she'll try to make up with the main ponies she hurt the most (Fluttershy,  Rainbow Dash,  and Pinkie Pie). In each of her attempts to make right,  she ends up screwing up (most likely by accident).
<p></p>I'm not sure how the plot will end with Gilda redeemed though.

<p></p>Back on topic!  Gilda's pride will be the major obstacle to her redemption,  but if she can be shown that you don't have to be <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Badbutt" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Badbutt">Badbutt</a> to be cool,  that would work just fine.  I imagine if she'd been around for "Dragonshy",  "Griffon the Brush-Off" wouldn't even have happened.

            Actually,  I imagine that Fluttershy being the first to forgive would be the case. Fluttershy was only afraid of her; Dash was pretty ticked,  and pinkie...well,  I doubt Pinkie would trust her at the end of it. I can see Dash thinking about forgiving her from the start,  but the mess ups making it seem like she was a jerk...So maybe Gilda flies off somewhere to sulk,  and Fluttershy just happens to be around for it?
