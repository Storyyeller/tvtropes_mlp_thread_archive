            I really wish people would start making Daring Do audio dramas. Those would be incredibly fun to listen to. Especially if the narrator is a British fan.

            Well I have the forums bookmarked anyway,  so I didn't notice.
<p></p><em>Does Daring Do have chapters or is it just one stream of text? </em>
<p></p>Canon Sapphire Statue has chapters,  so I think the whole series should.

            Welcome to the thread new guys.  You should probably be aware that this thread moves so fast that it often functions more like a real time chat room than a traditional forum.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Are there actually people who don't like Pinkie?</div>
<p></p>Me and Ginger.  I seriously disliked her for the first 10 episodes or so.  I've gotten to the point where I tolerate her,  but I still like her the least and wish she would keep her mouth shut most of the time.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> I think we can all agree that Fluttershy and Sweetie Belle are the best pony singers. </div>
<p></p>Agreed on Sweetie,  but I actually think Fluttershy is the <strong>worst</strong> singer.  Rainbow is best.

            Hmm,  I went ahead and watched the MAD MLP parody since it was on The Daily What.  Pretty weak,  but not painfully bad.  I do wonder why they bothered to keep the same names of the characters when they changed their character designs so much.  Oh,  and MAD Pinkie is less annoying than canon Pinkie,  so there's that.

            If ponies write fanfiction on Daring Do where do they post the fics? Hmm.. Maybe there's some fan magazine on the series. I mean Doctor Who has one. That reminds me,  I'd also love to see some 'Professor Whooves' stories together with the Daring Do stuff.
<p></p>Ah well.. Maybe the more creative people of the fandom get around to doing these things. I can only draw and program so I'm not much help.
<p></p>Goodness I'm tired. I'm grabbing my antibiotics and heading to bed. Night,  sweeties.
