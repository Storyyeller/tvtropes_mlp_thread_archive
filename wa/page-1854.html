            Rarity usually has pretty good episodes. Seems pretty predictable...but someone already mentioned how well executed they usually are so...

            This weeks episode is... Sweet and Elite,  right?
<p></p>It's a Rarity episode,  so I'm looking forward to it. But I think we all know how it's going to end.

            The episode I'm really looking forward to right now is "Hearths'-Warming Eve",  I must say.  "Sweet And Elite" and "Secrets of My Excess" both sound good,  though - and it's not like they're attempting to follow one of the stronger episodes of the season.

            The main reason I don't like grimdark MLP stuff is that there's basically no way to keep it from being completely OOC for all involved. Making everything grimdark basically changes the setting so much that it isn't really MLP anymore; it's a different pony universe where some of the names happen to be the same.  I mean,  the lightheartedness and the characterization are the two things I like most about the show,  and it baffles me that there's such a prevalence of fanfic that seems intent on stripping both of those out of it.
<p></p>@Red: I'm honestly not sure what to think of Hearth's Warming Eve.  Fanon demolition aside,  I'm almost convinced that it can't really live up to expectations.

            Yeah,  that one should be interesting. We actually haven't heard much of her dream to live in Canterlot since episode 1.
<p></p>Well,  okay,  her desire for a high-society life have come up in various episodes,  but that specific dream hasn't been seen.
<p></p>I wonder if there'll be a scene where Twilight is trying to convince Rarity that Canterlot isn't all it's cracked up to be,  but her explanation ends up making the place sound even <em>better</em>.

            Oh Kegisak,  you misread my motives. First of all,  regardless of whether or not I like rarity,  I like the idea of the plot,  and Rarity episodes are traditionally very good episodes. Only She can make me sympathize with a villain so much.
<p></p>Furthermore,  it's an episode about her having her nose as high as we can imagine it  and we can watch her suffer between deciding between her friends and the upper class. Ultimately we know the decision,  but watching her temptation will be glorious suffering.

            Well,  that makes more sense.
<p></p>Really though,  there's no way that she <em>won't</em> choose to stay with her friends. So in the end,  won't that make her look a bit better? Though interestingly,  when I think about it this is a pretty big question. If I had to choose between friends and my future... I'm not sure which way I'd go.
<p></p>NEW DISCUSSION: IF FACED WITH RARITY'S CHOICE (IE. WOULD YOU CHOOSE TO STAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS VS. PURSUE YOUR CAREER/DREAM),  WHICH WOULD YOU CHOOSE?

<p></p>Yeah that sounds funny.
<p></p>Also,  what I hope will happen is that the social connections in Canterlot are actually decent ponies,  and Rarity chosing to stay in Ponyville is a more difficult decissoin than just <em>oh,  they're actually jerks.  Yeah I'll stay put.</em>

            I guess when ti comes down to it I've alreadty made my choice once: I moved two provinces away from everyone I know to study.
<p></p>Granted it's a lot easier in my case,  becaus I can still stay in touch easily,  thanks to the internet. For her,  moving away to another city would almost certainly mean not seeing her friends again.

            Say,  that's a good point in and of itself. Do we know that she's going there to be with the upper class? I kinow the synopsis said 'social connections',  But I'd just assumed that they meant other fashion ponies,  so she could further her career. Connections with other people in the industry is important for any artistic career,  so...
<p></p>I hope it's more fashion ponies,  myself. I like all the fashion-type ponies we've seen so far,  myself. It would be nice to get another. I'm still hoping for another one-shot character again. Maybe a more experienced designer tries to take Rarity undr his/her wing or something. For bonus points make it a pegasi who literally,  physically takes Rarity under her wing.

            I really doubt it's going to be something petty.  Doing that would basically be saying 'Rarity's only going back to Ponyville because she doesn't like the color of the wallpaper in this house in Canterlot',  not because,  y'know,  <em>she has friends she loves in Ponyville</em>.
