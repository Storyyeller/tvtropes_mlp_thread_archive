<p></p>I'm not sure about the Equestria Girls designs. They look a bit off-putting to me but good writing and direction will hopefully make up for so-so art.

            The planets are Roman. Mercury was Hermes,  Venus was Aphrodite,  Earth if it was anyone was probably Demetir(Though I'm guessing it probably wasn't named after a god),  Mars was Ares,  Jupiter was Zeus,  Saturn was Chronos,  Uranus was actually Greek,  the god of the sky. Go figure. Neptune was Poseidon and Pluto was Hades.

            Earth is the only planet not named after a god.  Which is boring. We need a better name than "earth",  because "earth" basically means "ground".  We can do better than that.

            It's technically only a near-earth asteroid. It's orbit makes it pass us at a relatively stable frequency,  so for a while it was considered to just have a sort of eliptical orbit around Earth,  so it's sometimes referred to as a second moon,  even though it really isn't. IT's a fun fact to pull on people,  though.

            <div class="quoteblock">It's technically only a near-earth asteroid. It's orbit makes it pass us at a relatively stable frequency,  so for a while it was considered to just have a sort of eliptical orbit around Earth,  so it's sometimes referred to as a second moon,  even though it really isn't. IT's a fun fact to pull on people,  though. </div>
<p></p>Well according to Wikipedia,  it appears to orbit a bean shape in the corotating reference frame of Earth thanks to orbital resonance. But since Earth is outside of it's 'orbit',  it can't be considered a moon.
<p></p>It may sound complicated,  but Wikipedia has some helpful animations to explain it.
