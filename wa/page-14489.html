            @Red: I could definitely see that as well.  Maybe they could play it from both side.  Like Scoots finds out that she'll be unable to fly,  and can't tell RD,  and RD unintentionally makes a big deal about how awesome flying is before finding out.
<p></p>I'm not sure how they'd play RD off as being unaccepting of Scoots' inability to fly,  though; it would really go against what we saw of <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeplessInPonyville" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeplessInPonyville">Sleepless In Ponyville</a> if she backpedaled.   Unless what you mean is that RD goes into denial about it and tries to convince herself that yes,  Scootaloo will be able to fly an refuses to think otherwise.  That's entirely possible.   In fact,  I think it would make for an even better episode if Scootaloo was more accepting of her disability than RD is,  and Scoots eventually has to set her straight.

<p></p>There's a bit of a difference between not doing it,  and failing to do it. We've never seen Sweetie even attempt magic,  if memory serves. That said,  I do definitely see your point. Like I say,  it's not impossible she'd fly eventually,  but at the moment odds aren't good.

            Honestly,  it could go either way at this point. It's only ever come up two or three times,  and as has been noted,  we almost never see her actually practicing.  So basically,  who knows?

            We've seen Sweetie try to do magic. All she manages is sparks.
<p></p>So if you're using Pound as evidence Scootaloo can't ever fly,  you're using Pumpkin as evidence Sweetie can't ever do magic.

<p></p>A fair point,  although we don't <em>actually</em> know that Unicorn and Pegasi magic work the same way... for all we know phasing through shit happens to <em>be</em> Pumpkin's special talent,  so she happen to have an unconscious aptitude for it. Being able to do something unconsciously doesn't mean you can do it consciously. Sweetie's talents also fall in line with her peers - we saw a similar struggle from Snails. Although I might not call him a good measuring stick for talent... but to contrast,  pegasi who could be reasonably assumed as Scootaloo's peers <em>could</em> fly. Pound isn't the only evidence here.
<p></p>Either way,  that is a fair point if we have indeed seen her try to use magic. I don't recall where,  however. What episode was it in?

            @ Kegi: I think it was Babs Seed. It was definitely series 3 because everyone got excited that she was doing magic in a trailer. But then it turned out to just be sparks.

            They're tricky things,  the kids. Their anomalous based on any frame of reference we have,  but at the same time they aren't because we don't really have an <em>adequate</em> frame of reference. Their abilities put them leagues above older children,  and even above <em>adults</em> from what we've seen,  but the fact that we haven't seen other children means this sort of thing may very well be completely normal and all foals experience a sort of magical spike. Although in the latter case one would assume they would have procedures and protocols to deal with it,  otherwise I pit y the HELL out of Equestrian parents for those days,  weeks or months when their children have powers beyond their own,  yet no rational thought with which to control it.
<p></p>@Bad: Rainbow,  Fluttershy,  Hoops and Dumbbell in Cutie Mark Chronicles. Based on what Dash says(That she was the first in her class to get her cutie mark) we can assume that she's around their age,  possibly younger. Depending on whether or not Flight Camp teams are grouped by age(The state of Hoops and Dumbbell's cutie marks would give a clue,  but I don't recall if they had them or not,  though I don't <em>think</em> so),  that would put the other three at a similar age. All are capable of more sustained flight than Scootaloo.

            And Sweetie's peers that we've seen do magic then would be Snails,  Rarity,  Twilight and presumably everyone who can get into magic school.
<p></p>I believe Hoops or Dumbell had a cutie mark and the other one didn't.
<p></p>Just checked. Hoops has his,  Dumbell doesn't.

            Ah. Then in that case,  they're probably older. That makes it a bit harder to approximate Fluttershy' age,  which means the only age range we have is for Dash,  who is... anomalous,  so not a very good example of the average.

            I dunno,  Twilight seemed to be struggling with her magic until after she got her CM.  Snails already has his as well.  Rarity is a bit of an anomaly,  though.  Early bloomer,  maybe?

            She was struggling but still managed when not under pressure. And judging by the fact they even let blank flanks try out for magic school I think it's safe to assume they can perform magic.
