            I LOVE Egophiliac's comics (The one on the last page). He just gets the Celestia / Luna relationship so well,  in spite of the fact we still don't know what it's like.

            I don't think I can take much more of that; it only makes the foregone fall-out between supreme mutant ponies more heartbreaking!  Speaking of which,  I'm actually a little disappointed that there aren't <em>more</em> mash-ups of X-Men and My Little Pony.

<p></p>Actually,  having rewatched it "The Show Stoppers" is actually quite open-ended about what their Talents are.  While Sweetie Belle is quite clearly for singing and/or songwriting,  is Apple Bloom a carpenter or a dress designer?  And is Scootaloo a dancer or a stunt driver?  So ya see its not quite so clear-cut.
<p></p>It is dumb of them to totally miss the obvious though.  But then,  kids do that.

            That's actually something I wonder about Cutie Marks.  Is your mark (and thus your talent) determined at birth,  or is it something you can develop and decide on your own?  Can a pony,  for example,  just <em>decide</em> she's going to be talented at magic and then practice until they're even with Twilight Sparkle?
<p></p>"The Cutie Mark Chronicles" seems to indicate that its mostly a decision... except in the case of Rarity,  whose horn just kinda dragged her to a rock full of gems.

            A thought just occurred to me that if a Pony’s cutie mark is something seasonal,  “Picking apples” or growing carrots and what not,  that  pony must get pretty depressed during the off season. Unless ponies are naturally predisposition to not worry about such things. At least when compared to humans.
<p></p>Otherwise,  hopefully there’s quite a few ponies with couches and sofas for cutie marks.

I'd wager it probably has to do with both inclination and natural talent,  so perhaps some amount could be said to be determined at birth.  I think there must be some kind of median where a pony's enjoyment crosses with natural skill and thus determines their cutie mark.  Therefore,  a pony who enjoys magic and has high magical talent could probably get a cutie mark similar to Twilight's.  Of course,  since word of god is that they more or less decide these things on the fly,  I think it may be a very long time (if ever) before this question is answered.
<p></p>And I think in the case of Rarity,  since there seemed to be an indication that she thought she knew what she wanted to do,  but didn't have her cutie mark just yet,  when she started having her doubts,  maybe she subconsciously tapped into her magic to give herself a boost.

I do wonder though what would happen if you had a major change of heart about what you wanted to do after getting your cutie mark.

            If you enjoy something enough to declare,  beyond a show of a doubt,  that this is what you want to do with your whole life,  it would take something HUGE to change your mind,  I'd think. Although coming from families like the apple family,  where ponies seem to be sort of strong-armed into joining the family business might be a bit different.
<p></p>I was planning a fic after I finished the sequel to Feedback about that sort of thing,  actually.

            And remember Apple Bloom actually thought her cutie mark HAD to be apple related at first. So there is at least in universe evidence of strong arming,  from a certain point of view.
<p></p>if the blue text was about my avy it's suppose to be a little creepy,  is is CGI and I was aiming for near as I can get realism,  i actually have some youtubes posted of Sonya and a few other character animation tests

A quill and sofa store may sound like a good idea when you're in grade school,  but that guy could easily realize that hey,  these things don't go together at all!

            If Applejack's story is any indication,  while the young ponies in the Apple clan may (or may not) be forced into the family business (geez,  they sound like the mafia or something),  they don't get their cutie marks until they decide for themselves that it's what they want to do with the rest of their life.
<p></p>In fact,  that gives me an idea for a story. (Must resist the urge to call it "<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFortyYearOldVirgin" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFortyYearOldVirgin">The 40-Year-Old Blank Flank</a>".)
