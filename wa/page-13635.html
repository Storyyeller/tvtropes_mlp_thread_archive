            I think that so long as the show remains profitable,  we'll have pony.   Remember,  it is The Hubs flagship show.  Networks often milk their flagship shows for all they are worth.
<p></p>And I see this as a new beginning rather than an just an end.

            I doubt that Hasbro have any plans to stop the pony train. Looking at profits,  the MLP franchise is increasing in income,  in a time where many things like that are decreasing.

            @ Apple: You're right.  And we need to see the Crusaders get their cutie marks. Rainbow Dash will become a full-fledged Wonderbolt (maybe even the future captain.) It's clear to me that Twilight is Celestia's eventual successor. The ultimate destinies of the others isn't quite as clear,  but I trust the writers to make their fates satisfying to the viewers.

            @Cookoo Reactions from the actual kids in the audience have been mixed,  so far as I can tell. I've heard of kids who applauded the finale... and of one 3-year-old who insisted on closing her Dad's laptop as soon as she saw Twilicorn,  and quite firmly insisted that her plushie of Twilight — which of course had no wings — was the <em>real</em> Twilight Sparkle.
<p></p>It's tough on me,  though. I wasn't all that impressed,  to tell you the truth — and now all my friends on Facebook are shouting <strong>"FUCK THIS SHOW FUCK THIS SHOW FUCK THIS SHOW"</strong> a la <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNostalgiaCritic">The Nostalgia Critic</a>,  which only makes it worse...

            Honestly,  I think it is still too early to judge Alicorn Sparkle,  since we are not going to get any real explanation on what it means until next season.

<p></p>The post by this "dad" you linked to earlier still strikes me as rather suspect.  This is either the reaction of a very intelligent three-year-old,  or a very pissed-off brony.
<p></p>Also,  you need better friends,  Jake.

            If you'll recall,  I was rather suspicious about the idea when it was first announced.  Now,  I do have my hangups over how it was handled - a two-parter would have been perfect - but overall I did like the finale.  I think braying about how it's terrible and ruins the show is rather immature; of course people are allowed to dislike it,  but you have to give reasons for disliking.
<p></p>That goes for defenders,  too.  Lumping the minorly dissatisfied in with the brayers is just as rude and just as immature,  and treating people who were not satisfied with the finale as though they were never true fans is obnoxious.

<p></p>Glad you're coming around.  And I have to agree.  Criticism should be allowed,  so long as its constructive criticism.  If someone has a valid reason to dislike it and they express it in a calm and reasonable manner,  then I have no problem with it.

<p></p>This is good.  It further tells Hasbro that ponies are 'pastel coloured gold'.
<p></p>Btw,  Teen Titans is coming back....shows with popular support are notoriously hard to kill.

<p></p>Oddly enough,  I've seen some good discussions about the episode's merit on many a forum. From both ends.

            Yeah,  I do have to agree with people that say the episode really should have been two parts. To it's credit,  the pacing actually felt fine to me (The fact that it was a musical episode helped alot with that). It was just too condensed. I think it would have benefited more time to dwell on things. And I have to agree that Alicorn Twi has some jumping the shark potential,  It's just that it's only potential. It's not a bad thing itself. I doubt the writers will suddenly become crap at their jobs.

            I will agree about it being condensed,  but I actually did not mind the pacing. Like,  at all.
<p></p>I mean,  maybe they could have have expanded on Alicornication a bit,  but you don't want to drown in the mechanics of it.
<p></p>I do wonder...if TV shows didn't need ad breaks and people could use the full 30 minutes,  could we alleviate some of these issues with pacing that seem to crop up with these kinds of shows? Even The Legend Of Korra suffered from over-quick pacing.
