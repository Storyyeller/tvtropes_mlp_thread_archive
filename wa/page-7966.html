            @Story: Various things,  only a handful of which I've mentioned on this thread. Their's already the fact that I feel tierd but can't go to bed,  I'm still upset about missing out on the synchtube thing {Please don't go calling me butthurt or anything like that,  the Synchtube thing only contributed to my list of reasons why I feel horrible},  I still have a horrible headache,  and their's a couple much more serious matters that I haven't mentioned that are basiclly the top reasons why I feel horrible {Along with me not being able to go to bed}.
<p></p>To be honest,  it's impressive that I haven't already lost it and started tearing up,  especially with the more serious stuff.

            Thanks everyone. I suppose I should mention the more serious stuff that's causing me to feel sad.
<p></p>First off, My right front toe nail had gotten ingrown,  to the point where a part of it had to ripped off. It was quite painful,  and I have no idea how it got that ingrown. I'm very worried about what will happen in the future with it,  especially since what I went through was already painful enough.
<p></p>Now,  here's something even worse. In just a couple days,  My Mom has to get surgery to get her Uterus removed. I'm just worried that something will go wrong,  and my eighteenth birthday is coming up in a couple weeks. Maybe things will go okay,  and Mom isn't really all that worried about it,  but I am. I just can't bare to think of what......
<p></p>Allright,  now I am officially crying. Not gonna lie.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">

            I have a CEQ topic I was curious about. Is anyone else wondering what the heck is going down back in the Mane Six's world? I ask because at the beginning of the fic,  Doc Whooves give Tick Tock a time limit he expects before Discord's seal breaks,  like three weeks as his hopeful estimate? Well,  fic time has elapsed already half that,  hasn't it?
