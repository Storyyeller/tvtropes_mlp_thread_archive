            MMDW is probably the only episode of the show so far that I can honestly say was poorly executed on the whole,  so I don't exactly take any characterizations from it to heart. I still enjoyed it a lot though.
<p></p>Aside from that though,  Rainbow Dash has never really been that awful of a jerk this season. Is she <em>smart</em>? No. But poor judgement is pretty in character for her,  and it doesn't stop her from being cute.

            @Mio All of what? That one poorly written time that she became an egomaniac to the point of risking people's lives? Because that's the only time that said jerkishess has been amplified beyond Season 1 levels,  which no one seemed to have a problem with.
<p></p>And there are plenty of redeeming qualities to her character as aside from being cute,  same as everyone else.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_down.png" alt="[down]" title="[down]" height="16" width="16"> And what,  does AJ get a free pass there? The whole point of that episode was that they were <em>both</em> wrong and that over-competitiveness can strain friendships if taken too far.
<p></p>EDIT: Oh,  you're exaggerating. Okay. You just seem to take everything so seriously that it's rather hard to tell.

            Dashie is way too <em><strong>loyal</strong></em> to even consider doing something like that to Fluttershy,  y'know,  her longest-running friend and the first pegasus she <em>always</em> pulls up when action beckons for more than one flier to answer the call. If anything,  she wanted to make sure Fluttershy got the cider.
<p></p>I wonder what kind of karma necessitates such a terrible cider embargo to plague poor Dashie?
<p></p>@Mio: My own opinion is that Dashie has some self-confidence issues that resulted in bullying in her schoolfilly days,  so she became a brash tomboy and fought back,  and sometime along the way she believed her own self-hype,  which was further vindicated when she did her first Sonic Rainboom.
<p></p>Also good grief Cherry MX blue switches are really clackity when I type fast on them.

            I think it's less that her jerkishness was amplified this season (I think it was in MMDW,  but other than that it's about the same),  and more that that's the the only part of the character we saw most of the time.  She had jerkish moments in the first season,  but she also had nice moments to balance them out.  I mean,  yeah,  she was a jerk in Fall Weather Friends,  but she also had Sonic Rainboom come along to make her more sympathetic.  Her character was more balanced.  In this season,  we saw a lot of her bad side,  and only a little of her good side,  which makes her look a lot worse than she actually is.

            I think Dash is only considered a jerk by the standards of the show she's in.  In another,  less idyllic show,  she would be considered a very sweet girl.  She does have a lot of niceness in her,  after all.

            The Dashie/Fluttershy dynamic suggests to me she's trying hard to help Fluttershy get over her nerves to some degree :3 Always spurring her to keep up in action scenes,  and basically bringing her all over the place.

<p></p>Also,  as far as "Look Before You Sleep" goes,  I wasn't a big fan at first since I didn't really care for AJ and Rarity when I started watching the show,  but now that they've grown on my I really enjoy it.  It's a good character episode.  My only gripe is that Twilight looses a few IQ points when the tree bursts into her house.

            @JT I don't think it was even that bad. May the Best Pet Win never did anything so really show her in a negative light aside from her not knowing what made a good pet (unless you want to get into that canyon race ethics debate again,  which I don't think anyone does). And both that episode and Read it and Weep focused on her insecurities when it came to her friends and how she thought they perceived her.

            I <em>might</em> like Look Before You Sleep better now that I actually like Rarity,  but my main problem with the episode was Twilight.  She seemed completely out of character.  Plus,  the whole slumber party thing was rather cliche.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Hmm,  I always considered Rarity the least cute member of the mane cast. </div>
<p></p>Well yeah,  she strives for elegance,  not cuteness.  When she gets really happy and excited (like when she met Sapphire) she gets really cute though.
<p></p>AJ isn't very cute either.

            Twilight really can't deal with way-outta left-field random events because she plans so meticulously. When things go without a hitch,  they really go flawlessly for her,  but she has a tendency to overplan and leave out some minor detail which tends to rear its ugly head later when the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RNG" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RNG">RNG</a> starts tampering with her <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun">best-laid plans of mice and mares</a>.
