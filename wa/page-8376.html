<p></p>By the way,  I didn't like the whole "Who's on first"-esque skit RD had with Snips and Snails over the password in chapter 23 -_- It started to get on my nerves after a while

            Whose on first sketch. Isn't that the sketch where unless your name is Abbot or Costello it's impossible to do right? and a fanfiction author tried to translate it to PAPER?

            It was more that the password to get into this place was something like "Stop asking me questions. My friends are dying. Please let me in." But RD wasn't even aware that she was almost saying the password. So everytime she said some variation of that line out of desperation to get in,  Snips and Snails mistook it for another attempt at getting the password right.

            The Password is actually:
<p></p>1) Stop Asking Questions
<p></p>2) Let Me In
<p></p>3) I Forgot
<p></p>4) ???
<p></p>Hint: Part 4 is not 'the password'.
It's not even really done anything like Who's On First at all,  so that comparison is pretty unfair. Rainbow says the first two parts of the password while trying to get in,  so the guards think she knows the password and she keeps trying to get it right,  never quite getting that fourth part.
<p></p>If it were a Who's On First joke,  the Password would be 'Who' or something. Or maybe 'Password'.

<p></p>Opening narration just like from first MLPFIM episodes,  at first it would be same until moment of both Princesses imprisoned and Elements lost.  It would be Twilight reading story to some foals,  and reminding them that they shouln't fear monsters from stories,  instead they should be worry about evil robots,  but they are safe where Resistance are hiding.
<p></p>Many OC not related to any shows character (plus maybe somethign inspired by Archie comics). Like more non robotic minion for Robotnik expy. They could focused on many different aspects of this robotic empire.  One of them for example would focused on replicating magic with robotisation. Also  Big Bad would be allowed trope <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">You Have Failed Me</a>.
<p></p>Robotisation don't replicate magic and most of other abilities. It have even problem with pegasus flying. Only later version of process could allow robotized pegasi to fly fast and have really storng earth ponies. But cloud walking,  whether control and influence on plats is still almost impossible. Robotized unicrons  are almost useless.
<p></p>Raibow Dash would (thanks to some powerbust in backstory) have some limited ability to be super fast not only while flying.  Not use about her family,  I don't really whant to make Uncle Chuck expy into her relative.
<p></p>Twilight  she would be less magical user (because she haven't somepony like Celestia to teach her),  many times her trying magic would be catastrophic. She would more smart guy / leader.
<p></p>AJ would be robotized like Bunny Rabbot,  with all limps except one front leg mechanic (plus few more parst of body),  her tail not. Her character would be focused on her part robotisation and effects on her,  how it would make her life calling of farmer much harder. With only one limb to connect with land,  she would have try to achive same effect what canon AJ have by determination and willpower,  and Applebucking  much problematic with mechanic legs.  But at other hoof she would have super strength what is extremly helpful in other situations.

<p></p>More stuff coming...

            I would love a complete crossover between the two generations. Human-like species and all that included. Just don't focus on them,  and just focus mainly on the ponies. Problem solved! Besides,  Megan does sorta have a counterpart character in G4. her name is Celestia...

<p></p>Frankly,  I found the scene interesting to see Rainbow try and emulate her friends in attempts to get through. Could the scene have been a little shorter,  sure,  but considering the password's length and complication it makes sense. It's not like it was one word or anything.
