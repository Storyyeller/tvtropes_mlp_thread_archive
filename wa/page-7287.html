<p></p>Marvel has always tried to be more "real" (read cynical) about how it conducts its comics then DC. This doesn't always hold true but it is general rule of thumb about the way the two companies work.

            Oh,  I thought he meant "ideal" as in it was too perfect of a fit. "Idealistic" would have been a better word to use. Also,  it seems to me that both companies are equally cynical,  at least nowadays.

            She took the kindle from me out of spite PURELY because it's hers.
<p></p>Forgetting that she's using it to read A Game Of Thrones. A book that we actually HAVE A PHYSICAL FUCKING COPY OF!! Wheras I'm reading something that I NEED a Kindle for if I want to read it on a bus

            You don't think that she might have a use for <em>her</em> kindle? You're lucky she lets you use it at all. I know I don't let my siblings touch my electronics. In any case,  it's probably a sign that you should get your own.

Forgive me if I'm wrong,  but isn't that kind of one of the perks of being something's owner?

I had (and at times,  still have) a similar (although still quite different problem) with my brother. Here's one where he wanted to use the PC because he typically used it.
<p></p>"Let me use the PC." "No,  just use the Mac. It's on,  and due to the newest patch,  I can't play League of Legends on it just yet. Were you going to play anything that needed the PC?" "No,  I was going to watch youtube" "Then may I use the PC?" "Fuck you,  bitch."
<p></p>That's typically how it goes. Another gem,  from when my psp was screwed up because this one attendant on a train accidentally spilled some sprite on it (DAMN YOU CHINAAAAAAAAAA).
<p></p>"Okay,  you have the 3DS and the PSP,  could I use the 3DS at school while you just use the PSP?" "No,  I'm going to be using the 3DS at school." "Okay,  what about the PSP? No,  I'm going to be using the PSP at school." "Conor,  we only have 1 3DS,  and 1 PSP. Come on." -my mother proceeds to tell Conor to share- "FUCK YOU. I'M USING IT. -le rant-" -he hits me-.
<p></p>Now,  I can see the point of ownership sometimes,  but regardless of that,  if you're living in a family,  you typically should share if others have more need of something than you do.
<p></p>He just an ANGEL sometimes. And by angel I obviously mean the rabbit.

            @Lurker As I said,  I KNOW what she's reading. I know that she has no problems reading actual books. and I know that we have an ACTUAL PHYSICAL copy of the book she's reading on the kindle here in the house.
<p></p>I NEED a Kindle to read Project Horizons on the move. She DOESN'T need one to read A Game Of Thrones on the move.
<p></p>Besides,  she's always yelling at me and taking my <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MP3" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MP3">MP3</a> player all the damn time,  saying that I can listen to the music on my laptop while she can't. So it's not like she hasn't used the same logic on me constantly.
<p></p>Besides,  I can't get my own. I have no money.
<p></p>She's just being spitefull

            Then don't let her use your stuff. Simple as that. Really,  though,  ownership is ownership. She has every right to read on the much more convenient Kindle if she wants.
