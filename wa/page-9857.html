            @Kegisak. no. The dog is being euthanized because of a local ordinance that states that all dogs that seem to look like pitbulls should be euthanized.
<p></p>This is paraphrased but the bullshit is accurate.

            Those aren't horrible,  because I can at least parse it in the way the author intended. I can't do that when parenthetical clauses are used <em>dialog</em>,  though. Parenthesis have no phonetic meaning,  unlike other forms of punctuation. Are they an aside? Are they whispering the line? Do they just denote a longer than usual pause like a dash would? Hell if I know.

            Can we please not derail the thread to be about the dog thing?  I fully agree that it's tragic and the city council is stone-cold stupid for passing it,  but it had absolutely nothing to do with anything on this thread,  and it's probably going to devolve into political complaining really quickly.  I know we derail a lot,  but at least we're usually at least talking about something that's at least tangentially related to previous conversation.
<p></p>@Story: My headcanon is that when Twilight went to school there,  she snuck into the forbidden wing on a regular basis.  The guards knew all the time,  but just didn't care because Celestia told them to let her in.  Twilight still hasn't caught on that Celestia just doesn't give a crap.
<p></p>@Pannic: My main question is why they bothered with parenthesis at all when they could have easily worked it into the narration.  I get it if it were a third person narrator,  but in first person it just seems odd.

            Thing is,  it should go inside the period because the clause is referring to something in that sentence. Otherwise you got some weird island thing that's technically part of the next sentence despite not being related.

            Not to trivialize the point or anything but that is a horrendously common mistake there (Really it is). Not a single american high school system teaches the proper punctuation and method of using () parenthesis.

<p></p>I think it's just that most people don't really use parentheses enough to bother learning the rules.
