<p></p>As regards to <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoE" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoE">Fo E</a>,  I might pick it back up after some time,  I've gotten fairly far after all. It's just that scene with Pinkie just... Just hit really hard,  too much darkness I could handle at the time. Oddly,  my friend who I've tried to get into the show is reading the fic. He says he'll try it out one of these days,  but he's still not sure. But anyway,  I explained a bit about the fic and he is enjoying it quite a bit.

            The thing about the darkness of FOE is that it mostly comes from tragedy,  rather than malice. You don't have people being outrageously evil like you do in the actual games. (For example,  the Vaults were actually supposed to work and just failed due to accidents)

            Yup
<p></p>'The Vaults were never meant to save anyone."
<p></p>Singel biggest thing I love the most about FOE. Stable Tec was doing it RIGHT. The first priority of the Stables was to save ponies. Yes they had experiments,  but they were for good reason,  and every stable was left with instructions that saving the population of the Stable came before the experiment.
<p></p>Every "failed" Stable was either an accident,  or outside forces.
<p></p>antoher reason to dislike PH,  friggen sex-slave stable. GAH!
<p></p>Yeah Dark,  if the darkness in FOE is getting to you,  well wait the kep going,  but sta the hell away from Project Horizens. THAT is friggen grimdark just for the sake of being dark,  depressing,  and angsty. plus all the retconning to help "fix" issues that,  mostly only exist in the writers head.

            @edveed: Pretty much what I thought,  unless they do believe that Rarity would be mean to Spike no matter what. . .which is odd.
<p></p>I don't know,  I guess someone thought that using another character would have been better.

            @Seraphem:  The sex slave thing didn't actually have anything to do with the stable's original instructions.  That was a result of the ponies in it screwing things up.

            I haven't read it but I've heard Pink Eyes isn't so grimdark,  you could try reading that if you want to stick with that universe but not be so depressed by it.

            And yes Pinkeyes,  is just,  it's,  it is the total opposite of PH. Puppysmiles is just so so sweet,  and innocent and cute,  even the worst stuff suddenly seems fixable when viewed from her POV.
<p></p>It really is the anti-PH. PH is well written from a technical stand point,  but mired in darkness,  cruelty and bile. While Pinkeyes,  isn't exactly all the well written,  (Someone said the author wasn't a native English speaker,  and I could buy that.) But is so happy,  bright,  and just,  FUN that it's an amazing read.

            I <em>very</em> rarely read fanfic anymore,  despite writing them. There are a handful I enjoy,  but on the whole I find most of them just don't capture the feel of the show in the way I'd want them to. I'll be good over the hiatus with the art,  comics,  and rewatches though.  Or I can binge on <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerpuffGirls" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerpuffGirls">Powerpuff Girls</a> or something.

            Like I said before,  I can take tragedy. But it's starting to feel like EVA in the sense that all the tragedy won't really save anypony in the end. Or at best,  there'll be a long term bittersweet ending that won't mean anything because all the sympathetic characters died before they could get even that.
