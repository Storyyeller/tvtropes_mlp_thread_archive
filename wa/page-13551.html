            On another subject that I was thinking about,  what Myers-Briggs types do you think the ponies are?  I've seen some of them mentioned on the wiki,  and I just changed Twilight Sparkle to be put back in the INTJ list because someone had put her under ESFJ,  which she doesn't really fit at all.  She's definitely an introvert and a thinking type,  and her panicking in Lesson Zero and in Just in Time are perfect examples (to me) of an NXJ type getting scared of not following their schedules and imagining (using their abstract thinking) even worse scenarios that are removed from their concrete experiences.
<p></p>Then again,  I may be biased because I'm an INTJ myself.

            Hmm,  Twi and 'Shy are definitely introverts
<p></p>Pinkie,  and RD extroverts.
<p></p>AJ and Rarity,  are kind of in the middle. mostly likely extroverts,  but not very high on the demarcation between the two. neither minds company,  and they like being around other ponies,  but they also don't feel bad being on their own either.
<p></p>in order from most Introverted,  to most Extroverted
<p></p>Fluttershy,  Twilight,  Rarity,  AJ,  RD,  Pinkie.

            Twilight has become more outgoing,  sociable and friendly as her character development progresses,  so I can see why someone would label her as an extrovert. I'd still hesitate to call her an extrovert,  though. I mean,  her pastimes include reading and scheduling.

            Other music styles I'd love to hear but probably won't:
<p></p><ul><li> A soft folk peace sung by Celestia with sections of darker violin-heavy Classical for Luna that weave in and out in countermeasure.
<p></p></li><li> A mix of Trans and synth-pop for Rarity to fit with her style of well-produced and glamorous.
</li><li> More symphonic metal from Dash.
<p></p></li><li> A Dream Pop song for the CMC. Babs Seed proves that not only can they sing well together in harmony,  but work well in distortion which would go nicely as a dreamy song with heavy reverb and overlayered vocals. Something akin to Sigur Ros or the Cocteau Twins.
<p></p></li><li> And of course Country Rock for Applejack.

            @Applelight: Introversion/Extroversion isn't necessarily about confidence,  it's more about whether or not one recharges by being alone or by being with others,  and often whether or not one prefers being in groups to one-on-one interactions.  Twilight in the pilot would be a very good example of a confident introvert (she's confident that she knows what she's doing and that she doesn't need to make friends with the other ponies to do it) while Pinkie Pie's clingy behavior in Wonderbolt Academy is an example of an extrovert who is very UN-confident and is terrified of losing one of her friends (and thus is afraid of loneliness).
<p></p>@that list: I don't personally agree with all the classifications on that list,  at the very least,  Twilight is very much a J-type and would not be an INTP.

            I'd say she's both. At times she can be completely happy spending a day's time reading a pile of books while clearly enjoying time with her friends. I'd say Rarity's actually more introverted than Twilight. True Twi can go longer and deeper into seclusion than anyone else,  but can also be the most outspoken of her friends. Whereas Rarity even with her friends many times is a bit withdrawn and although is a great pony with customers,  she mostly keeps it professional and still spends more time in her Boutique.

FanOfMostEverything figured it out in the comments below: "Pinkie is subject to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle on a macroscopic level. She’s definitely within one ponylength of Applejack (who,  being made of neutronium,  is a convenient semi-fixed point in spacetime, ) but we know too much about her momentum to get more of a fix on her position."

<p></p>Now let's look at that leak:
<p></p>Equestria Girls: Oddly colored humans?
<p></p>I'm sure that the "leak" would be a troll. because the whole idea of making a doll line like the above to compete with the above and using <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent">Ordinary High School Students</a> to do so is a  ridiculous idea. There has to be <em>some</em> fantasy/sci-fi or else the line will look bland and comparison.

            Being introverted doesn't mean that one never likes to interact with others,  just like being extroverted doesn't mean that one never likes to have any alone time,  it's on a continuum.  Twilight may still like to interact with her closest friends and may have fun when she's with them,  but she also definitely seems to need her alone time more than some of the others do.  As I mentioned before,  when introverts want to interact with others,  it's usually in a one-on-one situation rather than in a big group,  or with people they are already close to if it's a bigger group,  like with Twilight and the others in her group.  If she was more extroverted she would probably be more interested in expanding her group of friends to include more of Ponyville.
<p></p>I suppose some of this is because I'm an introvert myself and I'm more comfortable with addressing a crowd where I can control the interaction (like giving a speech or performing a song) than with actually interacting with people I'm not close to.  I suppose to me it's about the level of control I have over the interaction,  to me,  giving a speech or talking AT people rather than WITH them is a different kind of interaction than the give-and-take of being in the crowd (it also helps that if I'm the one performing,  I can tell everyone else to be quiet and listen to ME).  Much of this may simply be my Asperger's rather than simply introversion,  though.  Twilight seems kind of like that type to me,  like when she announces things to a crowd like in Just in Time.

            That article basically confirmed the spinoff but it was silent regarding the Direct to DVD movie. It has been speculated that the movie would be a crossover or introduction to the new series but there is still a chance it will be a strictly Friendship is Magic affair. Right?
