            Re: not having enough fighters:Well,  I might give Stinging Nettles a respectable strength score,  after all,  collecting some of the herbs he uses would require a good bit of digging. I also imagine he'd have some muscle from grinding the things he collects into poultices and such.

            I'm thinking a Pegasus warrior. He comes from a village that holds true to a lot of the old ways,  Earth Ponies are trained to farm,  Pegasi are trained to fight. Since he's a Pegasus he was trained to be a fighter from an extremely young age at the expense of not having a standard education. This has left him woefully unprepared for the Modern Peaceful Equestria. Due to not having any real applicable skills he's turned to being a mercenary really,  pest control (big pests) bodyguarding whatever. He doesn't care much for luxuries and sends most of his pay home to his parent's farm.
<p></p>Anyway just what I'm thinking for now,  probably will revise later.

            Eh,  if we don;t have a lot of fighters I could multi-class the pegasus as a rogue/bard. Rogues are always useful - they do huge DPS if they can get to an enemy alive.
<p></p>Or I could go for the barbarian Cleric. I most came up with it because I thought it would be funny,  but... did you know in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverWinterNights" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverWinterNights">Never Winter Nights</a> 2 <em>orcs</em> have a racial affinity to the cleric class?

<p></p>But yeah,  don't be so easily discouraged. To best part about having everyone be more experienced than you is that you can pretty much ask anyone for help.

            Don't worry about not understanding Ginger it'll make more sense when we get into it.  Just remember to play how you think your character would react to the situation and pray you don't get any 1s.
