            I haven't watched ponies in a while. Lets get back to that. The Last Roundup.
<p></p>man,  AJ looks weird without her hat.
<p></p>Oh derpy. Say,  this is the first time they've directly called her derpy,  isn't it?
<p></p>that's right pinkie,  sarsaparilla does give you extra sass! FONV told me so!
<p></p>poor postman pony. Thanks pinkie!
<p></p>wait,  do we not even get to see the competition? lame.
<p></p>What? big mac is so sad he can't even pull out a single "yep"? Oh jeez.
<p></p>you know,  they really shouldn't hang out train window like that. It's just not safe.
<p></p>Yes! a hobo clown pony! Please tell me he has name!
<p></p>poor pinkie.
<p></p>wait,  did AJ say cherries? in the middle of the scrubland/desert? Ok then.
<p></p>no,  RD,  you <em>didn't</em> travel all over equestria at all. You only hit up 2 places!
<p></p>wait,  the <strike> hamster</strike>pony wheel was totally not oriented like that to the conveyer belt,  so how'd the cherries hit AJ?
<p></p>It's true,  kumquat is a fun word. Any word with more than 2 Us in it is a fun word. like <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugwump">Mugwump<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>!
<p></p>oh hey,  the pinkie promise again.
<p></p>uh oh,  rage pinkie. That can't be good.
<p></p>oh I see,  the named the place Dodge Junction purely so AJ could say "I gotta <a class="urllink" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=get+the+hell+out+of+dodge">get the heck out of Dodge!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>"
<p></p>jesus christ aj,  I was hoping this wasn't about not winning first place. I thought she was better than that!
<p></p>er...did big mac really jump ontop of winona there? That can't be good for her.

            @Death: Well if she's referring to a language as 'fancy' in place of it's actual name,  it's kinda telling that she doesn't <em>know</em> the language's name,  and the country is obviously close to Equestria. Imagine an american not knowing what french is. That goes beyond being uneducated,  that's practically isolated.
<p></p>Which <em>some</em> might consider a problem,  but I consider it the duty of every person to educate themselves about the world around them,  particularly when the country is close enough to yours to have a native speaker in a train ride's distance from your hometown.

            I'm actually a bit peeved by the whole cheese eating surrender monkeys trope as well.  I mean just look at The Song of Roland or any other piece of The Matter of France and you'll see that the French were accomplished warriors.  And yes,  I realise that the literature I'm discussing is presenting a romanticized vision of how things were.

            @ bad
<p></p>That's exactly right.
<p></p>What I meant to say is,  the French invented the concept of the knight in general.  Frankish heavy Calvary were amongst the most feared in Europe for centuries.

            Also,  maybe AJ DID know the language and she was just too exaserbated by the fact that her sis was being magically forced to speak in a different language.
<p></p>Not everyone can tell a language instantly upon hearing it,  especially if you're panicked and maybe haven't gone out of your way to learn much about it.
