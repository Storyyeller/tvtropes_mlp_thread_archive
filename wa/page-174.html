            The thing about TBC systems is that there really can't be all that much deviation in gameplay by their nature. Final Fantasy...ten or eleven,  I think,  did something new by having what was essentially TBS being coupled with free movement. I don't know how that went over myself,  but something of it's ilk may be good in this case,  since the ponies would probably move around quite a bit in any fight they'd be in. The bar that fills up before a character is allowed to attack in Final Fantasy games could be called focus,  or readiness or something like that,  and be tied to how much the player moves around in the battle,  and I suppose when the player chooses an attack it's done automatically?
<p></p>The whole 'single item that alters stats' is actually a good idea,  and I think that if the item was their element of harmony,  the game could have something resembling a moral choice system,  wherein as the player makes choices closer to the ponies respective element (ie. the player needs to split into two teams - One team needs to go and find help,  while another team needs to stay behind with a wounded rarity,  which could be potentially dangerous. the 'right' choice is having Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy on the 'stay' team.) gets the player more points for their element,  resulting in better stats.

            Come on.  The obvious fit would be to make the MLP:FIM game <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthBound" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthBound">EarthBound-esque</a>.

            Also,  I find it funny how Pinkie became an In-Universe bad singer over the course of the season,  because "Giggle at the Ghosties" was actually a good song.

            Did Pinkie become a bad singer? I didn't notice any particular badness in her <em>singing</em> in the last episode,  though the song itself didn't exactly ooze potential. The audience simply didn't dig the cut of her jib.

            I don't think she's a badsinger in-universe eather. In "over a barrel" was mostly due to the lyrical content and in the last episode,  I just thoguht the noble ponies were too much of snobs to appriciate her singing

            The way I interpreted it was the style of singing,  seeing as how it wasn't classical,  they might've thought it was more of a "Commoner Pony song"

Go to a black-tie party,  jump up on stage and sing "The Hokey Pokey" sometime,  see what kind of looks you get. One of the ponies even tells her "It's not that kind of party." Honestly I'm surprised no-one has taken that line and followed it up with a whip-cut to a rave or a disco saying "It's THIS kind of party!"
<p></p>As to her "Over a Barrel" performance,  I guess her audience just wasn't in the mood. Really,  if you listened to a crazy pink pony belt out a tune about being nice would you change your entire belief system on the spot?

Did someone say MLP:<a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a> and FF?  Oh and for the record,  I believe <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FF11" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FF11">FF 11</a> (MMO) and <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FF12" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FF12">FF 12</a> both fit the description of what you're thinking of.
<p></p>To go on a slight tangent,  I've been a lurker here for a bit,  meaning to get into the discussion at some point,  but this mention struck me as such an amazing coincidence that made me feel compelled to jump in.
<p></p>Anyway,  back on topic,  long story short,  I was really tired yesterday and managed to end up listening to MLP:<a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a> and <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FF13" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FF13">FF 13</a> music back to back,  which made me think "what if..."  Unfortunately,  I currently don't have access to the resulting picture,  but if people are willing to put up with an amateur editing job (I used Paint and got carried away because it was just too much fun),  I can provide a link later tonight.

I'm inclined to agree with Pinkie not being a bad singer.  To be honest,  the wording sounded like something on the same level of terrible as what Scoots had in her first draft in Show Stoppers.  The Pony Pokey was also wildly out of place for what type of party the gala was (as pointed out by one of the attendees),  so I can understand the reaction there.
<p></p>EDIT: Second sentence of my fourth section was more ambiguous than I initially thought,  so I fixed the wording.

            I think I'll go work on a plot synopsis and brainstorm some gameplay ideas for this <em>My Little Pony "The RPG"</em> thing we've got going.
<p></p>I like the idea of levelling the Elements of Harmony.  Another one is that I'd allow them to be switched around,  and you get different stats or even techniques depending on who has which one (I'm trying to imagine Applejack equipped with Laughter... drawing a blank,  unless we can somehow make catapulting Rainbow Dash a power).
<p></p>I'm going to work on a plot outline right now.  When I've got one drawn up should I just post it in this thread or what?
<p></p>... Also,  you know you've been watching too much Pony when you pray to Rainbow Dash to make it rain.

            I just re-watched the Pony Pokey song,  and realized that during Fluttershy-s scene,  at 16:26,   you can totally see the buzzards (that can really buzz).
