            the onlt poeple that would have any issue with that scene are people that have your level of almost allergic reaction to Pinkie. Ok yeah it does go a bit far even for normal Pinkie rules,  but again,  wait for the end of the fight and it's aftermath for her.

            If that's the case,  then I really do not appreciate the story jerking me around with half-truths. Why would a story <em>want</em> me to get angry about it's portrayal of canon characters if it was just going to reverse it all later? If it weren't for the constant assurances of "that's not actually true",  "it gets better later",  and "that will be justified" I would have dropped the story a long time ago.

            That's why I said "half-truths". It's misinformation designed to lead people to the wrong conclusions based on what they are given. If it weren't for the fact that I'm being pseudo-spoiled and told that those perfectly reasonable conclusions are false,  I would have no desire to read further thanks to those conclusions.

            @Perpetual Lurker: The reason that the story is misleading you is because it's also a mystery novel. The apocolypse was the crime and you need to reach the end to know how it happened.

            No,  I don't want spoilers. I guess I'm just unique in that I would have stopped reading this fic if I were reading it on my own.

            @Death: Well,  it's one thing if you're just posting all the stuff for everyone to see,  but there's the spoiler tag for a reason. Not only can I not CONTRIBUTE to this conversation,  I don't even UNDERSTAND it. There is literally no reason for me to be here right now,  and I'd KIND of like to be able to at least give my two bits.
<p></p>Also,  sort of odd about the different mothers day dates. When's Mothers day for you?
