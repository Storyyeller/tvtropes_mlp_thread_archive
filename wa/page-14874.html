            Hm.
<p></p>Was it stated how the evil queen in question was defeated? By Cadence alone or did she have some group of friends as well?

            @ Fergard: An evil amulet was involved. And Cadence showed her love or something. I believe it was just her.

            @ Crow: It's somewhat common fanon that Nightmare Moon would declare herself Queen or Empress after taking over. So it could fit. And she did defeat an Evil Queen aside from that. Chrysalis.

            It wasn't a "Queen" just a sorceress who had a magic amulet which enhanced her power,  while amplifying her darker emotions. She was threatening the Earth Pony tribe that had adopted Cadance,  and the pegasus went to confront her,  using her love powers to break through the amulets dark influences.
<p></p>Basically the amulet wasn't the Alicorn Amulet,  but something else,  which amplified and reflected the wearers emotions,  good or bad. And when the sorceress started getting angry and resentful of being feared by the ponies,  it started a feedback loop which pushed her further and further into anger and rage. Cadance broke it just with her love,  and next thing she knows she's on the ethereal plane Twilight was sent to,  alone,  till Celestia happened to come by and was surprised to find another being there.
<p></p>Oh and no mention of Celestia ascended Cadance,  rather she ascended on her own from her deeds,  Celestia being surprised when she found out,  but taking the new alicorn to Canterlot and adopting her as her niece.

            Seems weird that defeating some evil lady was enough to level up to alicorn.  With all the sinister forces around who need vanquishing,  you'd think the world would be stuffed to the gills with alicorns.  Heck,  Twi defeated three,  and didn't get her wings until she finished a poem.

Implying that becoming an alicorn is a matter of "getting enough XP".

            It wasn't defeating her,  it was the WAY she defeated her. Cadance showed such a deep and total understanding and connection to Love,  she essentially became a physical embodiment of it. Like with Twilight and Friendship.

            Nah,  Fluttershy hasn't hit that yet. Stuff like her breakdown in "Best Night Ever" or the ease with which she turned bitchy in "Putting Your Hoof Down" show that she does have a pretty big harsh side; it just takes a <em>lot</em> to get it out of her.
