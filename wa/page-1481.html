            btw,  I wonder who'd win in an all out "I'm trying to kill you"  brawl between AJ and RD?
<p></p>I always liked the idea that AJ and Big Mac can use the intense power of their hind legs to kick themselves off the ground at high speeds,  looking kinda like a rocket taking off while doing so. Mach speed HEADBUTT!!
<p></p>RD clearly has the mobility advantage. Would AJ have the lassoing skills to drag RD out of the air?

            Hmm.  No matter how you look at it,  RD has air superiority which is a game breaker in itself.  And when you take into account what kind of tricks she can do I'd have to put her into the same strength category as Big Mac at least.  I think the only way for AJ to win a confrontation is by wits,  and I think they're about even in that category.

            About the "earth ponies are all lower-class" thing,  I just re-watched "Call of the Cutie" and noted that both Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon are earth ponies,  so they would likely be wealthy ponies who are not pegasi or unicorns.
<p></p>And speaking of Scootaloo and the other Cutie Mark Crusaders,  I thought of something funny that could even be a possible episode of the show or at least a fanfic idea.  What if the Cutie Mark Crusaders went to the Gala?  Or to a children's version of it?  The idea came from me wondering what their gala dresses would look like and then it spiraled into imagining them actually attending the Gala.  I could easily see Sweetie Belle convincing Rarity to make dresses for the three of them,  but given their usual personalities,  they would probably be even harder to make dresses for than the "mane 6."  I'm not sure about Apple Bloom,  but I bet Sweetie Belle would try to help Rarity and mess things up (like in the latest episode) and in a shout-out to a famous meme,  Scootaloo could say that she wants her dress to look just like Rainbow Dash's dress,  only "20% cooler!"  And that's not going into some of the antics they might get up to at the Gala itself.  Especially if Apple Bloom tried to "help" her sister sell apple treats in the same aggressive manner she did in "Call of the Cutie."
<p></p>Also on the topic of Canterlot,  I wonder if Luna will at all appear in the story where Rarity goes there?  Especially since she was the only one who didn't get to actually interact with Luna in the Nightmare Night story (since her part was cut out).  Although Rainbow Dash didn't do much with Luna either aside from being zapped by her.

RD can avoid AJ sure,  but can she really bring the offensive? Her big moves (like the rainnuke) look like they can be avoided pretty easily if your fast enough to react and get out of the way. She'd need to get in close in order to do any damage,  and one good kick from AJ would end things instantly. Not to mention AJ's got her lassos,  which are capable of restraining RD. Take the wings out of the equation and I'd say RD's in alot of trouble.
<p></p>AJ's more level-headed than RD,  so it's possible she could take advantage of RD's overconfidence.

            RD certainly has AJ trumped in maneuverbility...with instant tornados,  storm clouds and the Rainuke at her disposal as well.  Plus,  she knows karate.
<p></p>But AJ has her lasso skills...if she was to rope RD,  she could pin her down to the ground and level out the playing feild.  And AJ's apple kicking skills are apparently a dangerous weapon.

<p></p>In a fight,  RD would probably start by launching herself at AJ with a kirate kick...which AJ could easily dodge and counter with a kick of her own.  As RD flies down at her with a Sonic Rainnuke in mind...AJ could counter with a kicked apple barrage that throws her off.  And if AJ lassoes RD and ties the rope down...RD will more or less have to fight her on the ground on an even footing.
<p></p>It would be a pretty even fight imoh.

<p></p>Sonic rainnuke + being hit in the face with an apple = massive downwards velocity resulting in an explosion when she hits the ground...a few inches away from where she was aiming.  Not much difference when we're dealing with an AOE attack.

            We also don't know AJ's durability. She could be capable of taking a lot more punshment than RD can.
<p></p>RD can keep the distance between herself and AJ,  but beyond that she can't attack unless she gets in close. Getting in close opens you up to rapid fire lassos and neck breakingly strong kicks.

            RD's speed is insane. AJ may be able to kill RD if she kicked hard enough,  but is she fast enough to do that while RD's avoiding her? Not to mention that with enough speed (like RD has) you can kill your opponent before they've had a chance to attack. AJ's advantage here is actually consistency. RD can do some impressive stuff,  but only with set-up or alternately,  she messes it up half the time. That could give AJ her chance,  but otherwise,  there's a reason that RD curbstomped a robot.
<p></p>EDIT: RD has range advantage no matter how you look at it. Her first sonic rainboom shattered rock from another <em>city</em>. You can't dodge that unless your faster than the sonic rainboom and can maintain that speed until it dissipates.

            I don't know who'd win that fight; RD is faster,  sure,  but AJ has more endurance and I always envisioned her as being a lot tougher; she'd be able to take a lot more punishment than RD would.  I get the feeling that Rainbow Dash would get a few good hits in,  but Applejack would be able to take it,  while if AJ gets in one solid kick,  RD is going to be stunned.  Stuff like creating tornados and whatever is an advantage,  but it takes a while to set up,  and it has potential to backfire.  If AJ lassoes RD while the latter is making a tornado,  RD might be screwed.
<p></p>Ultimately,  it comes down to whether RD can wear AJ down enough before AJ gets a good hit in.  RD can hit more easily,  but AJ hits much harder and can take a lot more punishment.

            I vociferously deny your claim that RD has to get in close to attack.  Nearly her enire repitour of possible attacks are AOE,  plus throw into consideration that she's a hoof to hoof combat expert on the off chance that AJ manages to lure her in close.

            Okay,  I think we've basically established that RD would win <em>as long as</em> she manages to avoid AJ's attacks long enough to wear AJ down.
<p></p>It could go either way depending one whether AJ manages to get a good hit in.
<p></p>EDIT: Also,  RD's attacks are impressive,  but they have a tendency to backfire pretty easily if someone interferes with the setup.
