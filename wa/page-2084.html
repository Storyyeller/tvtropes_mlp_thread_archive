            Umm,  I think this was probably already discussed but did anyone find the Wonderbolts showing up kind of weird? I guess I mostly only saw them as a stunt team so them showing up and actually fighting was really surprising. To bad they were completely ineffective.

<p></p>I checked and I'm pretty sure all the Wonderbolts who showed up were Mares,  so that leaves Rapidfire out.
<p></p>Is there any fanart of Spike dressed like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarioWorld" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarioWorld">Wario</a> yet?
<p></p>After watching the episode again I'm even more convinced that the growth dpurt Spike had was a hormone thing. It causes greed and a massive growth spurt,  and more hoarding causes more growing and more of the hormone,  so on and so forth,  ad nauseam.

            @All the fanoners here: Now I have found the hook to enjoy your Pony Cop Fanon <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">. I'm a huge fan of "This is what went on behind the scenes with other cool people while the heroes did their thing" stories,  and your cops fit in nicely with that <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">.
<p></p>Completely unrelated: just finished reading a short and sweet fanfic called "Tonight I shall be Laughter",  which I highly recommend. It's utterly goofy and non-serious,  with Luna deciding to just have an evening of relentless fun; it also has a super-serious Royal Guardsman who is just the perfect hilarious Straight Man to Luna's antics,  which our Peeler fans might enjoy,  too.

<p></p>The Wonderbolts are based on the Blue Angels. I always assumed they had some combat training.
<p></p>Its interesting to note that Rainbow Dash has also expressed an interest in becoming a royal guard in "Bird in the Hoof". Maybe to become a Wonderbolt you need to serve in the Equestrian military?

            @Apple Maybe i'm more serious than I thought,  because I pictured Gravy suggesting the Wonderbolts right away.
<p></p>Peeler would just chuckle in retort and say that he was prepared for a situation like this (cue him smashing a massive button that triggers the air raid sirens <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16"> )
<p></p>While he climbs up a building to get in a better position to strike,  he orders Gravy to shine his searchlight directly in Spike's eyes to disorientate him,  and Chips to attack him as best he can. Both of them knocked out of the air by Spike though,  with Peeler just managing to save them. That's when he goes: "... Get the wonderbolts."

            I think the Wonderbolts probably did serve in the military or whatever at some point,  but sort of went into stunt flying after the fact or something.  Really,  more than anything I'm mystified at how easily Spike stopped them; you'd thing they'd at least try to dodge or something.

            <div class="quoteblock">The Wonderbolts are based on the Blue Angels. I always assumed they had some combat training.
Its interesting to note that Rainbow Dash has also expressed an interest in becoming a royal guard in "Bird in the Hoof". Maybe to become a Wonderbolt you need to serve in the Equestrian military?</div>
<p></p>I always assumed that the comparisons were mostly superficial (uniform colors,  the fact that they are a stunt team),  but I guess I could be wrong. On the other hand they may have been there simply to fulfill the other part of the King Kong reference.
<p></p>As for Dash joining the military. . .I'm not sure if that would be a good thing or a bad thing.
