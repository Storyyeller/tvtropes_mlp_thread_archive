            Of course she'd be <em>generally</em> liked,  as the cheerleader/party-thing. But how many <em>meaningful</em> friends do you think she really has? I'd wager about six.
<p></p>Which is why she was so completely out of her depth when dealing with Cranky. Someone who has no patience for her antics,  and no desire to party.

            Pinkie is clearly smart in a different (right-brained creative?) way compared to Twi,  only she gets sidetracked as easily as Wilson Wade.

            I can't think of any examples of Pinkie really interacting with many non-mane cast ponies besides the Cakes to give evidence in either direction there. She <em>did</em> make a point that she knew <em>everypony</em> in town in her introduction,  and lots of ponies seem to show up to her parties,  so her being "friends" (read: on good terms with) everypony in town isn't exactly farfetched.
<p></p>In any case I just want to make clear that I don't have any problems with you disliking any of the episodes. I just have a weird compulsion to try and understand the reasoning behind other people's preferences. I do this with Ginger all the time. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            Heck,  before Griffon The Brush Off,  she wasn't really even all <em>that</em> well acquainted with Rainbow Dash.
<p></p>Thanks to one of the show's memes,  it's easy to forget this sometimes,  but there is a <em>major</em> difference between love and tolerance. I can totally get that she's on good terms with most of the town. After all,  fun things are fun,  and she does a lot of spreading of fun things. However,  do I think that she has really meaningful friendships with all of them,  beyond a preternatural ability to remember birthdays? No.
<p></p>Not to put too much of a dark spin on things,  but her idea of what it means to be friends with someone feels a bit shallow.
<p></p>Then again,  she doesn't much care,  does she? So long as it makes people smile...

            See that's the thing.  To me,  "Griffon the Brush-off" kind of characterized not just how Pinkie appears to R.D. but to the world at large.  Fun sometimes,  but most of the time she's that girl you want to tell off but just don't have the heart to.
<p></p>Also,  you can come to a party without necessarily liking the host.  Most parties are like this,  actually.

            Okay,  but when has Pinkie ever been show to <em>not</em> be on good terms with a pony? The only time I can think of is in Putting Your Hoof Down,  and that scene was a characterization issue in and of itself (and it's also on your non-canon list for similar reasons). With no evidence to support things either way,  there's no reason to assume that Pinkie <em>isn't</em> on good terms with everypony,  so I don't see a problem when the show comes right out and says she is.

            Pinkie strikes me as that girl who everyone knows and likes well enough because they're acquaintances.  Pinkie brightens folks' days up,  but they get little doses of her,  so no one pony gets too much Pinkie and gets annoyed with her.

            For most of Ponyville's residents,  Pinkie's prolly just that cheerful if slightly dotty party planner who throws a mean gig.

<p></p>It says more than that.  It says she's loved.  At that point it stops being anything other than a sugar-high rush of saccharinity.
<p></p>I can believe that nobody in Ponyville has any particular <em>problem</em> with her,  but to believe that they're always glad to see her,  always want to play with her,  always want to spend time or whatever... yeah,  not bloody likely.  Even Jesus Christ wasn't that popular.

<p></p>You could have specified. You know,  "the first one we see Pinkie talking to in that episode",  or something.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">It says more than that. It says she's loved. At that point it stops being anything other than a sugar-high rush of saccharinity. </div>
<p></p>When?
<p></p>During the song (whose high is immediately brought to a crashing halt by Cranky),  or afterwards? And does this take into account stuff like Rainbow Dash voicing the traits of Pinkie's that people would get annoyed by (and implies that they do)?
<p></p>There's a difference between a sequence that shows her at her best (to contrast with someone who she's completely unprepared for),  and saying that she's always omniloved by <em>everyone <strong>ever</strong></em>.
<p></p>Not to put too fine a point on it,  but I believe it's the former.
