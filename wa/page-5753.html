            My thoughts on the pictures:
<p></p>Pic 1: Happy honeymoon,  you two! *wave wave*
<p></p>Pic 2: Luna,  yay! And she looks like she's having a good time.
<p></p>Pic collage: a) D'awww,  Spike and Sweetie :3 b) Fancypants is back! Yay! c) Looks like the Canterlot ponies are loosening up,  since none of them seem to be disgusted with the way Pinkie's eating... d) Soarin' looks good in his little shirt-and-tie thing <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii"> And it looks like he and Rainbow are dancing together! e) Looks like a few of Applejack's family came to the wedding too!

            But I'll be at work when it premiers :(
<p></p>Oh well. At least next year I'll be at college and my new job will hopefully not require me to work Saturdays.
<p></p>Just as long as my roommates don't think I'm gay for watching the show XD Hopefully I'll have the good fortune my brother had in his second year of college and get a brony roommate.

            @Badwolfwho: I looked at that page that has the games on it,  and while Applejack doesn't have a game,  she does have a part where you can vote on which cake she would make for the wedding.  Who cares if it's not "flashy" like a Sonic Rainboom,  Applejack's part would be my favorite since she's making the CAKE!!  And a cake can be pretty flashy and fancy depending on how one makes it,  too.
<p></p>I also noticed that the royal wedding story is scheduled to be on the same day as the birthday of the real-life Queen of England (which I learned because it happened to be written on my calendar,  along with several other days that would be foreign holidays to me).  I wonder if that's a coincidence or is that on purpose?

            @storyyeller: I don't know if it airs in the UK,  but I'm sure someone like Ginger or one of the other people from that area on this forum would know.  And even if it doesn't,  I'm sure the British royals are wealthy enough to afford a good internet connection that would allow them to watch it on Youtube or download it off of iTunes.  (I have no idea if stuff can be downloaded off of iTunes outside of the US,  though.)
<p></p>And it probably is intentionally set on the Queen's birthday,  considering that the costumes that Cadence and Shining Armor are wearing look like the ones in the most recent royal wedding.
<p></p>Speaking of royalty,  I've heard that the British royals get in silly tabloids all the time,  and I would be surprised if "Gabby Gums" was the only gossip columnist to feature Celestia doing something "unroyal, " even if it's just a picture that catches her at a weird angle.

            Ooo,  RP is fun.  In my experience,  it's really tough to keep anyone together for anything,  but so worth it if they do turn out.  To put things in perspective,  out of probably at least a dozen table top campaigns,  I've only seen three of them play out entirely (and I was GM all three times).  I wouldn't give up those experiences for anything.
<p></p>One thing I want to warn about in terms of play by post is,  even if you consistently have posters online and around,  it's easy for people to lose interest (this was the case for a handful of PBPs I've been in).  And all it takes is the loss of one character to have stuff start unraveling.
<p></p>And the timezone thing is definitely a big issue with real time.  I'm actually in a free form one in the joint Training Grounds' IRC and it's such an anomaly to my previous experience so far (everyone's super enthusiastic and online almost every night).  And that's with a few people from timezones where our usual run time is like 6 in the morning for them (we have had them pass out in game a couple times &gt;.&gt;).
<p></p>And wow,  that was kind of longer than I intended.  I bet the topic's changed 3 times over by now. &lt;.&lt;
