<p></p>Harry Potter is also a bit overrated too. Now,  I'm not saying that it's bad by any means,  and I have only watched the movies {Which were pretty good},  but trust me,  when you spend years of having to go see those movies with your HP upsessed friend and your not even all THAT intreasted,  your intreast in it kinda tends to switch,  if you get what I mean.

            @Fallen Legend - There's nothing particularly <em>wrong</em> with Harry Potter,  and I actually liked the first three books.  It's just that they seem kind of generic,  and a little bit dated—like I could see something like them being something my grandmother would've read as a kid.
<p></p>They're just not my thing,  I guess.
<p></p>(Also,  my sister is a particularly obnoxious fan,  so I may be a little biased)

            @ginger: Especially when you consider what the muggles could potentially do to the wizards. I mean,  the wizards don't understand any kind of tech on average,  and are vastly outnumbered. On a one-to-one basis they're powerful,  but only with their wands at that.
<p></p>Which,  come to think of it,  is probably the <em>point</em> of the masquerade. Behind the face of arrogance,  the real reason for hiding is that the wizards are likely afraid of the muggles. Which also explains why they tend to look down upon them - a very easy(albeit stupid) way to overcome a fear is to denegrate it,  make it seem less than it is. It's all cultural posturing,  basically.
<p></p>which doesn't necessarily make it easier to read,  I understand,  though I myself liked the books.

            "Not for everyone" doesn't mean that. It means just what it says : It's not for everyone. The story is written in a way that could easily bother people,  both with how it functions and the prose itself. <br>The same thing could go for other things. I think we can both agree that 8Bit Theatre isn't that entertaining to us,  and yet it's popular. <br> <br>I'm curious as to the criticisms because Hussie does do some things badly,  and I enjoy seeing issues people have,  but it might clutter the thread a bit. PM might work,  or you can post it here if you want to.  <br> <br>As for Harry Potter,  I had to quit in the middle of the fourth book a while ago. I couldn't really care about anything in them.

<p></p>Seraphem,  I actually did in fact call the <em>books</em> overrated. (And I explained why a few posts up)
<p></p>Please do not presume to speak for me.  I will speak for myself.

            Yeah,  pretty much every aspect of Homestuck from the writing,  to the art style,  to the story itself is very much <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveItOrHateIt" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveItOrHateIt">Love It or Hate It</a>.  When I say it's not for everyone,  I mean that for a given person there's a very good chance that some aspect of the style is going to turn them off of it.
<p></p>As for the Harry Potter books,  they're relatively well written,  but I don't think they're particularly awesome,  either.  I'm a really big fan of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">Magic A is Magic A</a>,  and the HP magic system is too fairytale like.  Not to mention that there were a few too many "You could have ended the entire threat right there if you just did <em>this</em>" moments.

<p></p>Well I think you were asking about Homestuck,  but in case you want to know about <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoR" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoR">Mo R</a>!Voldemort,  I beleive his first awesome moment is around chapter 24 or so,  if you don't count the horcrux reveal.

            For me,  it's that pretty much throughout the entire story the author seemed to be screaming "LOOK HOW FUCKING CLEVER I AM!!!"
<p></p>I honestly got the impression that he was showing off half the time rather than telling an interesting story.
<p></p>And then he actually showed up in the story proper -_-

            @storyeller: As mentioned before,  Lesson Zero isn't the best for introducing the whole ensemble and concept of the show,  but it's a wonderfully cynical and almost parodical episode that'll likely be fun to an older viewer (or just an 'anti-cute' younger viewer). Once they know it's a funny show they can probably get into it's actual premise better.
<p></p>Don't read much of Harry Potter,  from what I've seen they look like they tried too hard to 'mature' with it's initial audience and made the story very grim and dark natured. I hate <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a> that vast,  it seems a bit pretentious,  and it's alienating a previous target audience for another.

            That's what I'm hoping. I'm guessing that she's just biased because she has it mixed up with the 80's show.

            it's basicly the episode with the most "this is for little girls?" moments. Yeah not the best way to show the show as a whole,  but best way to prove it isn't a typical girlie kid show.
