            I usually won't start a fic until it has a fairly sizable buffer of chapters.  Of course,  that goes right out the window if the description is interesting enough.

            well,  not sure about the villain,  cause there's a lot left unexplained about him,  he does come of as very competent yet he may also have made some serious mistakes,  and I'm waiting till the final chapter to make any real judgment on him.
<p></p>as to the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a>-ishness,  that's one of the things that makes people so interested in it,  by every right you should hate Firewall,  on paper he looks like a huge <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a>,  but he never actually seems that way in the story.

            @ginger: I think the treatment of the hero and the villain in a story are generally one of the biggest parts of making a compelling story. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticPOV" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticPOV">Sympathetic P.O.V.</a> I think is neccessary for both,  albeit with careful balance. If the hero is only sympathetic,  people will accuse the villain of being generic and a cardboard <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a> type that taints the motive and build up of the whole battle. If the villain is more sympathetic,  it makes it harder to enjoy the ending or even worse risks making the hero look like an unrootable 'bully'. Like you said,  a well rounded universe is important to make all aspects of a story enjoyable. So many medias have suffered due to overfocusing on one aspect too much.

            @Seraphem:  The main thing that has me curious about this fic is exactly that,  the way the main character is apparently tolerable.  When I heard it starred a self insert with Luna I expected he would be hated.  I really want to see how the author pulled that off without being annoying.

            @ Crow,  A lot of it is just the writing is so good,  none of the cannon ponies get OOC'd or altered,  Firewall is believable,  he's never made out to be perfect,  (and not in the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiSue" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiSue">Anti-Sue</a> way either) and his relationship with Luna actually develops realistically and starts off very believably.

            Just finished the re-written chapter.  It's pretty awesome,  and has enough new content to make it worth reading.

            @ Ginger,  well we don't really know until the final chapter just what the deal is with the vilain and whether he did screw up or what.
<p></p>Though most of the stuff he does turns out right for him,  the few things we've seen him get wrong were almost all due to him underestimating some pony.

            I'm pretty sure that that chapter isn't the end of the story,  just part one.  At least,  that's what I remember reading somewhere.  Following that will be some side stuff,  and then part two.  I'm guessing that part two is going to take place on Earth.

            The thing is ginger,  a lot of writers put less development into their villains.  They spend most of their time off screen after all,  and are really just there to create some conflict,  and the main focus is on the main characters and how they are influenced by whatever is going on.  I get why it bugs someone who likes villains as much as you,  but it's a stylistic choice.  Granted it's often a poorly done one,  but some people are more interested in the ponies we already know than someone's OC villain.

            The story as it is will end with chapter 15,  then he plans on writing a few short side stories,  then part 2 will be a sequel. He's already said that there won't be a cliffhanger between parts 1 and 2,  the may be a bit of foreshadowing at the end of something else coming,  but no cliffhangers
