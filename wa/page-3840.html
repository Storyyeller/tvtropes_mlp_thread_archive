            Dashie is quite mean at times,  yeah. Her loyalty is pretty subtle but clear (Like making sure Fluttershy was ahead of her in the Cider queue even though she ended up not getting any!),  and she's also the one who connects closest to Pinkie :3 (As seen in their interactions in Griffon the Brush-off and Party of One). It helps that she has seriously adorable gestures and fangirls a lot :3 While she can be impatient and pretty tactless,  she is also one of Fluttershy's closest friends apart from Rarity.

            @Ginger: I don't like shallowness,  nitpickiness or classism. As such,  Rarity didn't make a good imression on me at first.
<p></p>Also,  Suited for Success is my favourite Season 1 episode,  followed by Green isn't your Colour.
<p></p>EDIT: I <em>like</em> RD,  but that's partially because of her flaws. Personally I thought that Ghastly Gorge was out of line even though the pets accepted it. You shouldn't <em>want</em> others to be put in danger.

            Y'know,  maybe this stems from my ability to easily forgive villains.
<p></p>I KNEW from the very beginning that Rarity was a good person. She HAD to be,  she wouldn't have been given the element of generosity otherwise. KNOWING that there's good in someone makes it much easier to ignore their flaws I believe. So I never had the problem of thinking that Rarity or RD was a massive jerk.
<p></p>On the other hand,  because of that,  I wasn't surprised by her behaviour in Suited for Success in the slightest. It was confirming what I already knew.

            Yeah,  I kinda cringed at the way Dashie was hunting for her pet. I'm at least somewhat empathic in some way,  and the superficial way she started her pet-hunting made me wince.
<p></p>Granted,  she has had some character develepmont too,  to some point. These days,  at least ever since <em>Mare do Well</em>,  she's actually gone out of her way to team up with the others in some of the emergencies,  like during Spike's recent episode,  she paced herself to work with Fluttershy.

<p></p>I myself am guilty of some major jerkish behaviour (guilty grin),  so it's not like I'm a saint. I've abused my talent with words to stab people in the heart more painfully than any dagger could hope to acheive,  and used my <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare">Death Glare</a> on some annoyingly rude brat on the bus until he was reduced to tears before (in my defense,  he was being a genuine brat,  and he refused to apologise for his rudeness even with his mother's chiding!).

            @Applelight: To some point,  I suspect Dashie weighed her options and loyalties and decided that it would be even worse to let AJ escape again (and she might have suspected AJ didn't win any blue ribbons; after all,  she has experience with,  and hates,  losing,  and totally knows that feel,  mare). Afterwards she got caught up in the emotional high of reconciling AJ that she <em>almost</em> forgot about Pinkie and Rarity. I imagine she must have apologised/tried to make to them for it somehow before <em>Read it and Weep</em>.
