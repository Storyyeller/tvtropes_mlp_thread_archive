            I do like the CMFIS,  but I never thought was magical or anything. Just part of there persaonlity. when you know,  know for 100% certain what your goal,  mission,  purpose in life is,  and then something comes along that makes it seem like you can't fulfill it,  that you can't do what you are meant to do. That can make almost anyone snap.

<p></p>Well that's not really what a cutie mark does. It simply shows what you are good at,  and that you enjoy doing it. What you do with it is still primarily up to the pony in question and their personality.

            @Seraph Yeah,  I have to agree with Mio. The marks are a sign of talent or specialty,  not purpose. I bet that Twilight doesn't know what she wants to do with herself once she officially graduates from Celestia's tutelage. Combine that with the fact that when the ponies "snap",  as you put it,  they all do it in different,  believable (if cartoonishly exaggerated),  ways,  and I seriously doubt that you can just place it under any sort of blanket condition that all ponies experience.

            Yes that is what a CM is,  but they get when they find that certainty and it is a symbol of what they have found to be their purpose.

            I don't think CMFIS is magical. It's jsut how people get depressed when a core part of their personality is hurt.

            What you are good at ≠ your purpose. I'll use Twilight as an example again. Her talent is magic,  and she knows it. Does that mean that she knows what she want to do with those talents? Not at all. Does she want to research and invent new spells? Does she want to <em>teach</em> magic to others? Does she want to hone and refine her powers to become the greatest mage since Star Swirl the Bearded? She could feel that any of those things are her purpose in life,  only to find later that she doesn't want to do that after all.
<p></p>Believe me when I tell you from personal experience that knowing what you're good at and enjoy doing most does not automatically give you your purpose in life.

            I'm not putting it under a 'blanket condition'. I'm saying that I see CMFIS as simply a consequence of having that much certainty in what you are and what you are meant to do. They all snap in different ways because it's not an actual condition,  just a term to describe when a pony does end up confronted with the possibility they may fail in the mission in life and can't handle it.
<p></p>What story said pretty much.
<p></p>And the issue is tying it to Cutie Marks. The CM is just a symbol,  not a cause of anything,  getting a CM doesn't give the pony anything,  it merely represents what they are. As to Twilight,  yes her talent is magic,  but her purpose,  at least ATM,  the thing she wants most,  more then anything,  is to please Celestia.

            What does 'shame' have to do with it? Yes it is one thing that can be a part of it,  but it's not JUST that,  it is having your very core being,  what you KNOW to be true about yourself called into question. Something that can happen to anyone,  but ponies are far more susceptible to due to having such a deep certainty in who they are and what they are meant to do,  thanks to the mechanics of cutie marks. What this causes,  as seen,  varies from pony to pony based on personality.

            I actually think that in universe there would be a lot of disagreement on what a cutie mark represents exactly,  with some schools of thought putting more or less significance to it. CMFIS might be something that is also debated on.

            @Seraphem Except that they <em>don't know</em> exactly what their purpose in life is any more than we know exactly what our purpose in life is. Where in the show has it <em>ever</em> indicated that? All that happened in every single case was that the pony in question was ashamed at their failings at something they knew they were good at. Their purpose in life being called in to question is a side effect,  not a cause.
