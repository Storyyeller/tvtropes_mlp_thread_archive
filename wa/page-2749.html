            Pinkie is not a <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagificentBastard" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagificentBastard">Magificent Bastard</a>,  Gilda doesn't deserve to be eaten,  and the only reason the party went badly is because Gilda was too stressed to take a bloody joke and too willing to believe that everything was Pinkie's revenge on her,  because that's how her worldview works.  She doesn't get the idea of non-mean-spirited pranks.

            Fluttershy should have watched where she was going. She could have been hit by a runaway cart. Gilda was teaching her an important life lesson. Watch where you're going or a Griffon will eat you.

            Pinkie's talent is throwing parties. It's what she does best,  right? I honestly can't imagine how RD was able to set up ALL of these pranks (Pranks btw that seemed tailor made for Gilda) without Pinkie noticing.
<p></p>If she DID notice,  and you're saying "Gilda should've taken them in stride"? Bullshit! The goal of the party was preportedly to change Gilda's attitude and make her nicer,  correct? Pinkie was trying to change her from being a "Jerk". Okay,  she's clearly SEEN how Gilda reacted to things around Ponyville,  and it was obvious that she was in a foul mood. If I was in a bad mood,  the last thing I'd want is to be CONSTANTLY pranked. Why couldn't Pinkie have asked RD to call off the pranks and just been nice to Gilda? Gilda may be a jerk but she is NOT heartless.

            @Ginger: Of course Pinkie had a hand in it.  She and Dash set up pranks for Gilda because they expected them to make her laugh; the rest of the episode establishes that both Pinkie and Dash view harmless pranks as silly fun,  and either of them would have taken the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">Humiliation Conga</a> in stride <em>because it was meant to be fun</em>.  Pinkie and Dash weren't trying to be mean to Gilda,  but they didn't get that Gilda was way,  way too prideful to ever laugh at herself or ever admit that she was wrong.

            Well yeah things could have gone better,  but Gilda's overreaction to everything was just her being a bitch.  It isn't Pinkie's or Rainbow's fault that she can't get over herself.

            I don't think all of the pranks were intended for Gilda,  but I do think some of them were,  like the presents that were obviously intended for her.  As for Rainbow directing Gilda towards pranks,  I think that was just her getting caught up in the moment.  Gilda just at a spicy snack,  wouldn't it be funny if I gave her a pranked cup right after?  She wasn't really thinking at the moment that it would piss her off,  and it wasn't premeditated,  she just thought it would be funny.

<p></p>No. They wouldn't have. People shouldn't assume. Especially if said person was clearly in a bad mood beforehand (as Pinkie had witnessed)

            Ginger,  you're arguing that Gilda could have been redeemed with someone who's in the process of writing a thirty-thousand-word Gilda redemption fic.  I agree with you,  but saying that she has the potential (which she <em>does</em>) doesn't excuse her behavior.  She was in the wrong in that episode,  and even if Dash forced her hand a little bit,  she doesn't get many points for what she could have done since she didn't.
<p></p>Edit: of course they wouldn't have pranked Fluttershy.  She's not a prankster and wouldn't have enjoyed it.

<p></p>They just expected a prankster to accept jokes made at her expense. Something they both would have done.
