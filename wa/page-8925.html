            Ah,  so he was still an asshole then.
<p></p>Ah well,  I suppose it's too much to ask to assume that someone wrote him mellowed out a bit with age. This fandom does love it's assholes. OR rather,  it loves inflating its assholes to an absurd and unreasonable degree.

I've suddenly decided that if I continue reading Projet Horizons,  I'll treat every scene with Goldenblood as a temporary <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">Genre Shift</a> into a comedy.
<p></p>EDIT: By the way,  Kegi,  in case you don't know,  the sequal to the awesome fanfic <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/MyLittleAlicorn" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/MyLittleAlicorn">My Little Alicorn</a> is basically a Blueblood redemption fic. (Of course,  he was even more of a jerk in the original fic than in canon,  but the sequal is doing a decent job of portraying him in a sympathetic light.)

            Oh yeah,  that's all fair enough.
<p></p>It's just at this point I'm more disappointed with how the fandom treats Blueblood as a character,  blowing him wildly out of proportion and constantly baying for his blood. He's consistently taken form someone who's a bit self-centered to enormous levels of egomania,  if he isn't portrayed as outright evil(though I realize that's not the case HERE).
<p></p>He HAS potential to be an interesting character,  but damn if people ever utilize it. A single trait envelopes his entire being,  and nobody bothers to give him any depth beyond it. Even when he IS the focus of a story he rarely starts with any other character beyond "ME!"

<p></p>I've only read two of his scenes,  and kegi's right,  he's just tiresome. Like he's the ONLY character who's allowed to say anything intelligent in any scene he appears in.

            @ Kegisak: To be fair,  he <em>was</em> portrayed as an enormous egomaniac in the episode. That was his only defining characteristic. You can't get a much worse portrayal than having a prince completely reverse all the rules of chivalry.

            @Mio: Either or,  really.
<p></p>@CDRW: Which is true,  yes. but he appeared for all of five minutes,  I'd expect people to fill in the gaps <em>somehow</em>. Even when I was writing him at his egomania-est I still had to develop some things beyond that.
<p></p>Just,  you know,  get creative. It's impossible for someone's ego to consume their entire existance,  no matter how narcissistic they are. Give a CAUSE to it,  maybe. Fill it out a little bit.
<p></p>Each of the other antagonists always gets something else in every story that they're in,  whether they're the villain or protagonist. Sure,  some of them are cliched in and of themselves,  but they're always there. Emotional vulnerability,  envy,  trauma,  depression... but Blueblood is always EXACTLY the same as he was in the episode,  with no attempts to fill in the blanks. He exists in the fandoms mind as a punching bag,  someone you won't feel bad about hating,  and it bothers me a bit.
<p></p>@Sereg: Huh,  that's interesting,  actually. May have to look at it.

I wonder if that says something about us as a fandom. "Everyone has redeeming features no matter how bad they are,  unless they're self-absorbed."
