            @Freeman: Some say the middle place truly does exist.  I don't know if I believe them or not; it's always just over the hill in the distance,  or on the other coast.

            @Sereg: Disagreement isn't a bad thing; it just gets boring to have the same debates so many times.  Also,  if we use a relative power scale that takes the comic into account,  it makes it even <em>more</em> likely that Celestia isn't uberpowered; as Twilight manages to take out Chrysalis on her own (albeit with a power-boost from her friends),  when both she and Chrysalis were boosted by the comet.  But enough of that.

            Also consider that even though Chrysalis is boosted from the comet,  she <em>isn't</em> hopped up on weeks/months of a guy engaged to a love goddess.  She may well have been weaker during that showdown than she was during the wedding.

            Twilight's gotten way,  <em>way</em> stronger since the start of the series,  probably half through field experience and half through adjusting to her Element.  I mean,  this girl was breaking out in a cold sweat with every other spell at the outset of the series,  and now she's mowing through changeling hordes,  reversing gravity,  and turning stuff into oranges like it ain't no thing.
<p></p>My headcanon is that Twilight today could probably give Nightmare Moon (at least as we saw her in the pilot,  which probably wasn't at full force) a run for her bits on her own,  even before the ascension business.

            @Storyyeller: He was a unicorn when she met him.
<p></p>@Enlong: Agreed.
<p></p>That said,  it's true that Tilight has clearly become <em>way</em> more powerful over the course of the series and stuff that she used to have trouble with are no longer clear representaions of her limits.

<p></p>Even if she can't use he new powers well yet,  there's nothing stopping her from breking out her old unicorn hax.

            @ Turtle:  I hope they touch on this at the beginning of Season 4.  Twilight needs to adjust not only to being a princess,  but to being part-pegasus.  I'm hoping RD and Fluttershy will help her with this.
<p></p>Really,  the only part of <em>Magical Mystery Cure</em> I didn't like was how she flew (or at least glided) effortlessly right at the end.  Of course,  we didn't see her trying to land.

            I'm thinking that she's going to have to find the balance in all the powers before everything starts working at 100% efficiency again.
<p></p>Like maybe the other magics interfere with each other until one truly understands them and how they work together as a whole.
<p></p>Imagine the Hax when she starts combining the different tribal magics.
