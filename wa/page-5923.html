            G1 wasn't all that bad,  about average for an 80's cartoon series. G2 was a bit more meh,  still about average for an early 90's girl cetnere cartoon.
<p></p>G3 was when it went completly to shit. And G3.5......NO,  just NO!

            G1 is a bit cheesy from what I've seen,  but it's a lot better than G3. Apparently,  it's been described as "the Disney princesses move to Sunnydale".
<p></p>I think G2 is pretty easy to avoid,  seeing as it's toys only.

            no Story,  G2 was a show,  but think it only lasted like 1 season,  and was the weirdest in that...there was no point to them being ponies,  they acted completely human,  walked on two legs,  didn't even try to pretend they weren't using there hooves just as if they had fingers,  they were human in every way but appearance.

I laughed so much when the girl was running in circles in the loading room. Largely because I do the same thing in the actual game,  just with a controller,  not a kinect,  and if I did have the kinect version,  I would do that myself. ^_^

            @Ginger: It was <em>technically</em> G1,  if you go by the toy lines. It was just a second series based around G1. Think of it as a spin-off,  in a way.
