            and the Zebra's weren't religious,  Holy War is just the best name we have for how they felt,  it had nothing to do with religion and everything to do with them thinking anything associated with the stars was a lovecraft level horror. including Luna. (appeartly some time in the distnat past the Zebra race almost went exticnt when there main city and surrounding are was decimated by a meteor strike. this left them with a very VERY deep seated fear of the stars)
