<p></p>Good evening everyone,  it looks as if we're finally getting all that rain we missed earlier in the year here in Virginia.
<p></p>And ponibooru is acting up on me so you'll just have to go without an amusing image along with this pagetopper.

            Lurker: I like your theory of RD getting more development during the series,  there actually seem to be mild hints of it being true (eg. she is becoming gentler to team mates like Fluttershy and showing slightly more tact at times rather than being a perpetual <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">Leeroy Jenkins</a>). I'm not sure about her outshining Twilight as the main character,  but it would be nice if they shown her qualities in leading the team a few times,  though the same could be said for a few other characters. Maintain her as a fiesty braggart though,  she wouldn't be the same without it.

            @Psi I don't mean that she becomes the main character. I mean that she becomes the go-to leader of the group. She practically already is,  with episodes like Hurricane Fluttershy and The Last Roundup being great examples of her taking charge,  but she still has to contend with Twilight's Main Character status when it comes to big things.
<p></p>In any case,  it really is a nice subtle trend of development. It took me several viewings of the episodes in question to notice.

            As pathetic as it is,  I've actually noticed RD's development to more emulate that of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a> than Raimundo.
<p></p>Season One: Mischevious brat that dreams of being important. Usually butts heads with another more responsible but equally prideful team mate (Gordon/Applejack). Eventually they perform a huge act of heroism that finally gets them recognised.
<p></p>Season Two: Shows the effects of their new found respect,  unfortunately it's completely gone to their head. Often more egotistical and rude and take a less confident friend under their wing,  albeit mostly to vent their own self importance. After a few severe screwups due to their arrogance however,  they learn more humility and act kinder to their protoge.
<p></p>If Season Three has RD Take a Level In Kindness and become a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Cool Big Sis</a> that pretty much seals the development.

            @Death Cloud: I like the idea really,  we need more development between the two,  would probably work for some Scootaloo spotlight as well. I know Faust didn't really take to RD being a big sis type but somehow I think it gels into her character rather well as a big redeeming aspect (eg. Griffon The Brush Off,  Hurricane Fluttershy).
<p></p>I admit it's likely just a coincidence and RD is just a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a> type,  but the role order has sort of worked well into how her character works and almost looks like subtle <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>.
<p></p>I wasn't bothered by her actions in MTBPW or LE really,  par maybe rejecting the poor falcon. I kinda felt bad how everyone rooted for the 'underdog' over the poor thing. The rest she's just sort of in 'loveable jerk' mode.

            watched Fall Weather Friends. I'm starting to play a sort of a game here,  how early can I spot the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">aesop</a>? I immediately thought that this would be a Winning isn't Everything,  then during the Iron Pony they had some Cheating is bad elements,  but then as soon as I saw Twilight was in the race,  I thought Tortoise and the Hare. Then at the end it just kinda got generalized into a Sportsmanship thing. I could have fun with this!
<p></p>also,  enjoyed the use of classic cartoon cheating in the race. It's not proper western animation until you have a swarm of angry bees turn into a question mark because they can't find someone!

            @Psi: From what I heard it probably had more to do with the thought that their proposed dynamic would be "to mean" for the show. That they had two sister dynamics already.

            Fall Weather friends is a pretty fun episode.  I certainly enjoyed the classic examples of how to cheat in a cartoon race.  Even if Dashie was pretty crass in the episode as a whole which I typically dislike.

            I get she would still be a very flawed big sis and it wouldn't be her key dynamic,  but it is nice how she has shades of this at times,  like with Fluttershy.
<p></p>Fall Weather Friends is one of my favorite episodes (arguably THE favorite after Lesson Zero). I love a cartoony 'battle of egos' scenario. For some reason I also really love the RD vs AJ rivalry. Maybe it's the 'playful jerk vs haughty straight guy' dynamic (eg. the Porky vs Daffy shorts).
