            The book has a branched structure,  which has an inherent level of interaction involved. I'm rather sure that the trope is applicable,  in a way.

            Yeah,  but in all the CYOA books I've ever read the death routes are completely arbitrary.  You might as well flip a coin.
<p></p>Just about every Zelda game has several of its more important elements become pretty well known,  and the moon is one of the more memorable aspects of Majora.  The creepy face,  the way it constantly looms overhead slowly getting bigger as your time runs out.  If you played the game,  that moon is one of the things that really sticks with you.

            @Fighting Fantasy I loved them. Of the ones I have I completed 'Deathtrap Dungeon',  'City of Thieves' and 'Freeway Fighter' (that one has a hell of a dick move at the end. If you enter a mansion near the end,  and there are no clear signs that the house is any more dangerous than anything else,  you get rabies,  guaranteed. The annoying thing is that the rabies doesn't kill you until the very end of the book. You literally return home,  give the supplies to your home town and finish what the quest of the book was,  then die. It was more of a bad ending than a game over,  but it's still a pain,  as you will almost definitely do this the first time. Wow,  that was a long rant...)

            @Orion: It's also because many Legend of Zelda fans were relatively young and the mature and dark themes of the game often hit close to home and <em>hard</em>. I imagine ponies like y'all might find the scenario kinda too familiar given what Luna did when she had her breakdown a thousand years back.
<p></p>Also g'night Kegi.

            I don't know.  I don't remember if the game ever ascribes any actual malice to the moon itself,  but I don't think so.  The face is probably just there to make it look creepier.  Which worked.
