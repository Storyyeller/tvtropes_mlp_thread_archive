            I just figure that at this point everypony has a bit of all three races somewhere in their family tree,  so while you're most likely to end up the race of one of your parents there's always the possibility of ending up as one of the others.

            I think Pinkie should teach them the ways of breaking the fourth wall. She won't be around forever,  and somepony needs to protect/break reality!
<p></p>Christ,  two seconds in and they start crying their eyes out. I bet the Cakes return to a ambulance and a police car with some firefighters just watering the ashes of Sugarcube Corner,  while Pinkie is just standing there,  not knowing what went wrong.
<p></p>Those babies' first words are going to be: "HELP!"
<p></p>Wait,  did Pinkie even test the temperature of the bath before chucking them in? In addition,  you're supposed to hold them in place,  to stop them drowning.

            @ The crying: I know,  right? The twins are adorable and I love 'em to bits,  but the thing I hate about them is their <em>crying</em>. I mean,  I know that they're babies and babies cry,  but seriously,  starting to cry because your parents aren't there even though your <em>favorite playmate/big sister</em> is <em>right there in front of you</em>,  with <em>no other reason</em>? Doing the same thing just because Pinkie won't let you chew on a towel? Another one with no reason,  when Pinkie's singing the Piggie Song? Plus there's that bit in <em>Ponyville Confidential</em> when they just start <em>shrieking</em> for no freaking reason!
