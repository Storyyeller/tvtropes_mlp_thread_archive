            Just a random thought,  probably related to fanfics.
<p></p>I personally think that the pilot,  especially the Mane Cast meeting each other,  felt a bit rushed. I think it would have been nicer if MC defeats Nightmare Moon with the bond they formed throughout the season I.
<p></p>Of course,  it raises the issue: The Mane Cast is pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">Fire-Forged Friends</a>. Also,  why else would Twilight stay long enough in the Ponyville long enough to make friends to begin with?
<p></p>Well,  I suppose there might be a way that would require Twi,  possibly due to Celestia's mission,  to stay there long. I don't know.

            True.
<p></p>I just think that it would have been better if the defeat of Nightmare Moon was the finale of Season I. Then again,  it would make defeating Discord in Season 2 pilot be a bit redundant.

            @D Roy: The moral wasn't <em>entirely</em> nonsensical,  it was just executed badly.  The main issue is that it was supposed to be along the lines of "You shouldn't assume that you're correct when you have no clue what's going on",  but it came across more as "You shouldn't try to explain things".  But I'm really not interested in having this discussion again.
<p></p>Also,  I don't think it would have worked too well as a season closer because then Twilight has no reason to be in Ponyville to start with; some sort of external element had to force her to make friends.  It wouldn't have been in character for her to just go for it from the get-go.  I do think it was kinda rushed though; making it a 3 parter might have helped.  It would give more room to build up the friendships.  Maybe have Twilight come to Ponyville a few days before the Summer Sun Celebration rather than the day before.

<p></p>I think it would have worked if Twilight was sent to Ponyville,  as part of a mission from <strike>God</strike>Celestia. It might involve her getting involve with the townsfolk and particularly the Mane Cast. The precise nature will require elaboration,  though.

            I finished reading the revision of Past Sins.  It's...a lot better than I expected,  and most of my major problems with the first couple passes got smoothed over much more believably.  I'm still not convinced it's hardcover material,  but yeah.

            Ew,  I don't like peaches. I don't want them to smell like that.
<p></p>I've never actually thought about how they smell,  but I doubt they'd smell like real horse.

            They'd probably smell kinda like horses,  minus the hay and poo smells,  and probably not nearly as strong as in real life due to the fact that they bathe regularly.

            The first two episodes are my favourite of the two parters,  like all the two parters more time could have helped it but outside that it was solid for me. It's a good pilot as well,  Nightmare Moon's defeat works well for the opening of the series as well and I don't think the series would work as if it was a finale.
