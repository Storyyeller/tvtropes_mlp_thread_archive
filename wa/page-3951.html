<p></p>My High School was a tad on the small side,  so doing sports was kind of expected.
<p></p>The most epic of my fails was probably throwing a discus into the crowd watching me though,  but I've got several more.

<p></p>and yeah kinda hard to figure out,  helped a lot once I saw a picture someone made of a FOE gun,  the handle is behind the gun,  not under it and shaped to fit in a mouth.

            Yah AJ's was officially wartime techology,  but she liked to leave out the "wartime" part as she wanted the inventions to be useful in times of peace as well.
<p></p>Anyway,  whenever I tried high jump,  I'd run into the bar.
<p></p>I also jumped into a gymnastics horse once. That hurt,  but I've had far worse injuries.

<p></p>The time I tried javelin,  it went about half the distance that the others went and it was still landed incorrectly.
<p></p>I couldn't get a shot put far either.

<p></p>25 feet!? That's like over 7 meters! I didn't even manage 3!
<p></p>I once calculated that my strenght score in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonsAndDragons" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> would be 3. That was a touch depressing.
<p></p>Also,  our tennis coauch used to do exercises where the worst players were subjected to bumsup. (The other players hit the balls at our bums.) I was the worst player in <em>every</em> exercise! (I quit fairly soon.)
<p></p>EDIT: @Ginger: Different stables had different conditions. 2 was the "never gets opened" stable. Scootalooand Applebloom were experimenting to try and prevent future wars.

            Stable tec was run by the CMC's.
<p></p>Stable 2 was a control Stable,  no experiment.
<p></p>Each stable's opening was up to the ponies in that stable for the most part,  baring a few tests.

            Aha! Idea for the flying thing.
<p></p>Does anyone remember when I first wrote the whole legend of the three kings thing? How it stated that the world would literally be torn apart by the war?
<p></p>This takes place in an alternate continuity where the war <em>did</em> rip the world apart - but the magical force was so powerful that it managed to keep it alive,  just fragmented. so now the world is basically just a whole bunch of chunks of earth floating in an atmosphere with no real directed gravity. Pegasi become the dominant race by virtue of being the most able to transport themselves. The story centers around an earth pony who's inventing a mode of personal transport for non-pegasi,  which the pegasi... don't care for. In continuity with the three kings this means that the three tribes still <em>really</em> don't like each other,  so there's a huge incentive for the pegasi to be less than pleased with this,  and for a pretty huge-stakes game happening wit the whole thing. Sound interesting?
