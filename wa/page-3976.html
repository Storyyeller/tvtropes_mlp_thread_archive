            Mr. Cake also has that nervous look around him. Guess it comes from pinkie. I was surprised by how tense everyone was at the party with celestia in the phoenix episode. Pinkie was like LOL Dont Care,  steal your cupcake!

            @ Ginger,  that comment last page about the writers doing adult scenes for shits and giggle reminded me of a story. Two Disney animators slipped in a few seconds of Mickey and Minnie doing it to a real of film that was being show to Walt at his birthday party. Walt saw,  and after the film got up to the stage,  and asked that the people responsible come on up for a round of applause.
<p></p>he then fired them

            Pinkie lives for Pinkie... she doesnt seem to care what she does.  I wonder if they'll ever do an episode where she does something and it makes them burst into tears ... you think she'd learn her lesson then?
<p></p>I cant get the thought out of my head of her going to one of her friend's weddings and just taking a huge bite out of the cake before they got to do the whole cake cutting ceremony thing and the bride bursting into tears.

            @Kegi,  I must've misspoke,  I meant the accents,  and that M. Cake's was so average I couldn't specifically identify it with anything. Besides,  I'm going by stereotypical accent here,  I know full well not all Canadians don't sound like that,  I mean most of the voice cast is Canadian for pity's sake.

            She seemed fairly insensitive in the Cider episode.  Even going so far as to brag about how delicious the cider was to Rainbow Dash.  Im pretty sure Dashie was going to pummel her before she got distracted.
<p></p>She vaguely redeemed herself by offering a mug to Rainbow at the end but she was still fairly oblivious and gluttonous by buying and drinking an armload of mugs... before anypony even got to have one!

            I can honestly say I've never heard a Canadian with an accent even close to Mrs. Cakes. Although people from Mewfoundland and some of the other maritime provinces have a reputation for having all sorts of crazy accents.

            I dunno... I just couldnt put it past Pinkie to not do it.  If she were a wedding guest I'd have my cake in a locked room with security guards at the door and Im sure she'd still use her logic defying Pinkie Powers to get in there and snarf it down :(

            There was a big food fight at the reception. Pinkie Pie assaulted him with cake,  pretty much.

<p></p>She  gave a whole new meaning to the "feeding each other cake" tradition. Also there first dance was "Gotta Share",  she spent the whole time winking at his best man and groomsmen.
