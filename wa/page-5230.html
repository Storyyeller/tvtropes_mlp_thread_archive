            @Ginger:So you think RD should be the cause of the problem?
<p></p>I don't know. If she was just organizing them to get the job done,  I wouldn't mind to much. The fact that she has turned this into a competition (as is her wont) by making it about a world record just sets off alarm bells in my head.

            Except she's only good,  as long as it's something both her,  and anypony she's leading are interested in. You know she has neither the patience nor the temperament to deal with any of the issues with real leadership. While she is good at it,  she clearly only does well while in a group that is already tightly focused and willing,  she would make a great team captain/coach,  but any thing bigger,  she wouldn't be able to handle.

            Congrats,  Rich!
<p></p>Funny story about the "Hurricane Fluttershy" previews: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">I had compared that bow-wearing Pegasus's appearance in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.hasbro.com/common/assets/Flash/Puzzle/dad2af6e1c4311ddbd0b0800200c9a66/8c641b185056900b109f50d776462357/images/bg_mlp_puzzle_bg_51.jpg">the Puzzle Adventure screenshot<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small> to her appearance in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_pCZhIx4Zk">the Hub commercial<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and was almost certain that they were the same pony,  but since the commercial didn't show her cutie mark I had thought they could be twins (not likely,  but possible). Then <a class="urllink" href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1463030084001?bckey=AQ~~,%20AAAAocraEwE~,%203x9DnTXoVWYTjOYco_elvChHdiuw8n1b">the Puzzle Adventure clip<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> came out and revealed that they are the same Pegasus after all,  but she does have (what appears to be) a twin!</span>
