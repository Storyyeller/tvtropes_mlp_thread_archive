            I consider myself lucky that I get 700v dollars from the government a month as part of social security. But that's barely enough to cover bills and rent as it is. And heck,  my parents don't trust me with savings so I don't get to use what I keep. Bah,  no matter how much I try and convince them otherwise,  my parents still can't imagine that I could be a fully functional member of society because they want to protect me.

            Your parents don't trust you with your own savings account,  Dark? It sounds to me like an attempt to keep you dependent on their charity,  but I'm probably being overly misanthropic.
<p></p>Everyone,  I'd like to apologise for such a massive derail of the thread.  I likely should've just gone with my discussion on the importance of cathartic release in regards to the show.  But I'm still glad to have created the oppotunity for people to vent their frustrations,  even if it isn't the purpose of the thread.
<p></p>Uh-oh,  have I killed the thread?
<p></p>Anyway,  it's probably best that I hit the hay so you all can have a proper discussion about ponies.  Goodnight.

            I thought of an interesting parallel between Rarity's interactions with Sweetie Belle in Sisterhooves Social and Rainbow Dash's interactions with Derpy in The Last Round-Up.  This came about with me thinking about how Derpy and Rarity happen to have the same voice actress,  and that Rarity would hate having someone as clumsy as Derpy at her boutique.  And then I realized that she'd probably yell at Derpy for trying to "help" like she did with Sweetie Belle.  And then that's exactly what happened when Derpy was trying to help Rainbow Dash fix the town hall.  In both cases,  someone was clumsily trying to help and getting scolded for it.  Also,  both Derpy and Sweetie Belle do comply with getting out of the way,  but end up causing still more trouble (Derpy breaks the floor with her butt and Sweetie Belle's attempt to entertain herself by drawing pictures led to her gluing Rarity's valuable sapphires to her artwork).

            @Crowfall: No,  I didn't even think of that until you mentioned it,  although it would be funny if that was true,  especially considering Rainbow Dash's tendency to crash into things herself (although she can also be very agile as well).  I was more noticing that Tabitha St.Germain has played characters who were on opposite sides of the situation; playing both Rarity,  who is annoyed at Sweetie Belle's clumsiness,  and Derpy,  who is so clumsy she manages to smash through the floor just by sitting down.
