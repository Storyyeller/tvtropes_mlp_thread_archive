            |Actually,  a stealthy earth pony would be pretty sweet. And it's not like they haven't got any reason to be; they're portrayed as the most physical in <em>every</em> respect,  which means they should be fairly decent at sneaking. Plus they have the potential to blend into any of the other races with some creative prosthetics. Not to mention their connection to the earth could have some serious advantages. Undermining,  anybody?
<p></p>An Earth Pony's strength has always lay in their versatility. Having no natural aptitude for any one from just means that Earth Ponies would need to be creative tacticians in war time,  and that makes them easily the most dangerous.

I don't think you've read it,  but CEQ actually has an earth pony who specializes in stealth and infiltration. Granted,  she has special powers to do it,  but it still works. <br> <br><div class="quoteblock">Would there be Earth Ponies who utilize magical plants in warfare?</div>
Zecora already does fancy things with plants. I could definitely see the earth ponies utilizing them. <br> <br>@steve. Applejack's hat.
