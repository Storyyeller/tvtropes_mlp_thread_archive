            She  just called that speak - 'fancy',  for sake of joke.  What's big deal,  this not suggest that she didn't know "real name",  or maybe it just nickname for that language.  This show always give silly names to real life stuff.
<p></p>(Didn't France was country what AJ refered in Applebuck Season?)
<p></p>And other topics:
<p></p>Derpy,   I didn't noticed  anything wrong here :I
<p></p>And that episode: from what I saw people liked it more than because of Derpy,  not counting those who didn't liked it,  or trolls.
<p></p>French military - No comment.
<p></p>Griffins - I still like to think they are warrior race with also strong cooking related culture.

            I like to think of the oranges as being odd,  but essentially well-meaning. After all,  they <em>did</em> take in their niece,  no questions asked. And brought her to their parties,  so they were obviously making an effort to try and help her adapt. It's just difficult to say what they were like,  since we never actually saw anything of <em>them</em> in the episode.
