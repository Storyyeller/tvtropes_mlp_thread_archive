<p></p>Hey,  <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldFartMode" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldFartMode">back in *my* day</a>,  if you wanted to take the music with you,  you lugged around a portable cassette player or,  even more clunky,  an 8-track player.  Most of my mom's cars had an AM radio,  period.  When the Sony Walkman came along,  it was fairly groundbreaking.
<p></p>As for typing,  I learned to type on a reconditioned Underwood manual typewriter from the 1920's.  I still have it. Those things were built to last.  I've never weighed it,  but I think the thing weighs about 40 pounds.  Carrying it around for a while is a workout.
<p></p>And yes,  I still type while looking at the keys.

            @Star: If your head hurts that bad,  I'd suggest taking an aspirin,  and lying down for a while. If you're hot,  maybe take a wet rag and lay it on your forehead to cool down a little.
<p></p>@Syd: Yeah,  I vaguely remember portable CD players being a tremendous novelty.

<p></p><strong>Buuuuuuuuuuut he's not hot and bothered</strong>

<p></p><strong>he's relaxed as he can get</strong>

<p></p><em>you might hear that somepony blew his top</em>
<p></p><em>but I can guarantee it wasn't he</em>
<p></p><strong>When he was young,  he lacked per-spect-ive</strong>
<p></p><strong>he was terrorized by fantasies and fears</strong>
<p></p><strong>as he matured,  he's grown objective, </strong>
<p></p><strong>and he hasn't gone-to-pieces in 300 years</strong>
<p></p><em>There's no trace of a fever</em>
<p></p><em>there's no knocking of the knees</em>
<p></p><em>'cause his Fah-ren-heit</em>
<p></p><em>is exactly right</em>
<p></p><em>at a perfect thirty-two degrees!</em>
<p></p><strong>these lurid postings are very dire</strong>
<p></p><em>'like an infection that taints the blood</em>
<p></p><strong>they can flare up like wildfire</strong>
<p></p><em><strong>he won't have them-he detests them</strong></em>
<p></p><em><strong>those who spread 'em,  he arrests em</strong></em>
<p></p><em><strong>'cause the safety of his brain demands he nip it in the BUD!</strong></em>
<p></p><strong>Buuuuuuuuuuut he's not hot and bothered</strong>
<p></p><em>and he's not in a stew</em>
<p></p><em>If there's anyone</em>
<p></p><em>who should worry,  son</em>
<p></p><em>it should probably be you.</em>

            Morning folks.  Just got back from a job interview.  I think it went rather well.  At least I hope so because I really need a job.
<p></p>Typewriters are fun,  but my preferred method of writing is still by hand.  I don't know why,  but I always work best when I write something down on paper and then type it up later.

            The witch has just given me a tone of grief,  and a slap around the back of the head to boot.  It's taking every fibre of my being to resist the urge to beat her to a pulp.  It's all because her friend's daughter took her to Venice.  That makes me utterly fucking worthless according to her.  All it took was the sight of my workboots in the corner to set her off.  Goes from calling me a lazy good for nothing self centred childish bastard who can't look after himself to a worthless disappointment who is a shameful burden to her whilst her friends daughter takes her on holiday.
<p></p>I'm going to move.  I was expecting too anyway so it's not a problem.  Will take some planning though.

            @Apple:  Jesus.  I don't know how you put up with that.  You definitely need to find a way to move out because that sounds horrible to deal with everyday.
<p></p>@Purple:  I had to look up what that is and apparently its just cursive.  Never heard it called joined-up writing before.  It isn't like anyone uses it for anything other than signatures these days though.
