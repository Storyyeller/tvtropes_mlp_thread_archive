            I'm still curious if any Executives that look at how massive we bronies are,  are able to understand WHY we love the show,  i mean the REAL reasons,  all the little details,  or if tey will just start pumping out <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">Follow the Leader</a> crap with a few superficial smilarties in an attempt to repeat the phenomenon.
<p></p>Doubt The Hub or hasbro will be that stupid yet,  they've been pretty understanding,  I'm think other TV stations.

Doesn't matter if it makes sense or is done well,  i just hate it.

            @Seraphem: Well,  at the very least,  the people who actually make the show seem to get it,  and at the very least Hasbro seems willing to at least make an effort to understand the fans,  which is more than a lot of fandoms get.  I mean,  they gave us Vinyl Scratch and Lyra toys; there's no way that would have happened if they weren't paying some attention.

            @ginger: Well that's the brilliance of it,  isn't it? Rainbow'd been upset about this stuff since early in the fic,  Grayscale gave her a "little push" (her exact words) and now Rainbow's off the deep-end. It's not like it wasn't set-up,  and all the points she brings to the table are pretty spot-on.

            also,  less the 9, 000 to go on the documentary.
<p></p>it WILL get funded,  but doubt it will go signigigantly over.
<p></p>would prefer to see it at least 70K just in case the one guy that took the 10K prize is trolling.

            I should start watching those LP's again sometime when I have more free time. Though unfortunately,  the guy doing them hasn't even gotten to the last case of teh second game yet. I wonder how he'll handle the multiple ending thing.
