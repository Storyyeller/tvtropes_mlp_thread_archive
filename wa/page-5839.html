            @storyyeller: Well,  I have some proficiency with several programming languages. Mainly Java and <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AS3" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AS3">AS 3</a> (with Flixel). I did do <em>some</em> C++ a few years back so I'm a bit rusty there. I never found Java to be "annoying to code in" though,  fairly simple and intuitive. Why do you say it's so annoying? Python on the other hand... *shudders* I found that to be the most frustrating programming language to learn and use out of the bunch. Flexible yes,  ease of use for me - dead <em>no</em>.

            Once you learn any language other than Java,  you'll know.
<p></p>The big issue is that Java's syntax is intentionally limited,  so it takes a lot more code to represent things than in other languages. Java is designed to be written by <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDEs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDEs">ID Es</a>,  not humans.
<p></p>Python is pretty much the opposite. It's designed to be as easy to use as possible. If you just want to code something fast,  nothing beats it.

            There is an interesting coincidence concerning my plans for Saturday and the episode that's going to come out that day.  Because my grandma is having a birthday party on Easter Sunday (her actual birthday is later in the month but the party is on Easter),  I'm making a cake for the party on Saturday.  Hopefully nothing will go wrong like in the cake mystery episode!  I just thought it was a funny coincidence that I have plans to make a cake on the day the cake mystery story airs.
<p></p>About the issue of pony names and their cutie marks,  they're not necessarily a literal interpretation of their cutie marks,  but it might have something to do with their appearance or some aspect of their cutie mark.  Pinkie Pie doesn't have a pie for a cutie mark,  but the "Pinkie" part describes her appearance and the "Pie" part fits her job at Sugarcube Corner,  even if her specific special talent is throwing parties.  Rarity's name isn't a gemstone,  but it would describe gemstones (since the most precious ones are rare).  And Cheerilee's name has probably more to do with the smiley face on the flowers in her cutie mark rather than the flowers themselves.

<p></p>What part did you find hard?
<p></p>How about this. You give me a Java program (console only,  since I'm not familiar with the GUI stuff),  and I'll rewrite it in Python and we can see which one is shorter?

<p></p>Shorter programs mean that it's faster write and faster to modify,  assuming you don't have an IDE autogenerating your code. And if you want maximal performance,  C++ is better than Java anyway,  though it's true that Java with standard JVM is fast enough for the vast majority of tasks.

I would like to use C or C++ for making a game engine for a Mega Man game but... I would need several tutorials on setting up the libraries necessary (<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenGL" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenGL">Open GL</a>,  etc.),  creating the windows,  and using the libraries to create and show graphics on-screen in those windows. If you could,  could you direct me to some tutorials that deal with this matter?

            Well there's the Lazy Foo SDL tutorials. That's what I've used. The nice part is that since <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyGame" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyGame">Py Game</a> is based on SDL,  it will be basically the same thing if you later switch to <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyGame" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyGame">Py Game</a>.
<p></p>Of course SDL doesn't have the best API. I've heard that SFML and Allegro are better,  but I haven't really tried them.
<p></p>If you want widgets,  there's QT,  but I've never been able to get it to work.

            @Sereg: Which ponies do we know of in canon who changed their names?  About the closest I can think of is the implications in Cutie Mark Chronicles that Pinkamena Diane Pie is the pink party pony's real name and that Pinkie Pie is her nickname or a new name she chose for herself,  but I don't ever remember a character canonically changing his/her name.
