<p></p>huh..what is thi...I don't even.....you've lost me,  how the hell is that in any related to Pinkie? </div>
<p></p>It's analogous to her season two antics.
<p></p>In S1,  Pinkie was energetic and a little dumb but never did anything outright inexplicable and was held back by reality a lot (falling when she came out the top of the screen in "Applebuck Season",  Nobody understanding her in "Swarm of the Century, " getting tired in "Party of One" etc).
<p></p>Damn near everything she does in "It's About Time" or "A Friend in Deed" though requires her to pretty much be immune to whatever reality is in place so it would work.  If there was really a crazy girl hiding stuff in parks or in people's houses,  you'd think it would disturb a fair number of people and might even get the police called (she does basically have to break-and-enter to stash some of that stuff).  The fortune-teller gag requires Pinkie to be able to afford the accessories and decorations,  be able to set up a tent at any random part in town,  and somehow do this all herself and near-instantly so it can be sprung as a joke.  Oh,  and then a random brick just happens to fall on Twilight's head,  which even Pinkie admits is impossible.  And of course,  <em>she's</em> the one who gets to go on the sneaking mission even though Twi of all people should know better,  <em>and</em> the whole time she thinks its about a birthday present (S1 Pinkie struck me as being a lot sharper than that).
<p></p>And so on and so forth.
<p></p>The way this discussion is going though,  Pinkie could cause the coming of the Candypocalypse and I'd be the only one to see it as a Flanderization.

<p></p>That wasn't always true in season one since she did have the whole pepe le pew gag going with Dash,  but I do see your point.

            I think there are changes there but they are <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a> rather than a consistant evolution for the most part. Things don't work her way in Baby Cakes or MMM Mystery for example and she gets given a reality check. Meanwhile she still has loads of reality warping moments in Season One (eg. the Pepe Le Pew chases with Rainbow Dash).
<p></p>I kinda think more developed character interactions would help. Almost everyone paired with her is just a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLandersMinder" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLandersMinder">Cloud Cuckoo Landers Minder</a> (something Twilight alone already does perfectly). I liked Griffon The Brush Off and A Friend In Deed because it paired her with different character types that brought out more chemistry from her. As said before I'd like her to team with Rainbow Dash with more prankster stuff at some point. Pitting her against an even crazier character may also help.

            I do remember in one interview that Lauren said that she always meant Pinkie to be really zany and OTT,  but had to tone her down in the beginning because execs thought she would be to annoying. Though when she proved more popular then expected she was able to make her more zany like she intended.
<p></p>That's at least what I remember,  make of it what you will.

<p></p>Yeah she did a few things that are against the laws of physics,  so did S1 Pinkie,  it's pure <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>

<p></p>IRL,  yes,  in Ponyville,  ponies would just see it as Pinkie being Pinkie,  and the only time we saw her stash something in some ponies house was in Twi's which 1. Is a public library,  2. She's in all the time anyway. So your claim that shes "breaking and entering" is flawed.
<p></p><em>The fortune-teller gag requires Pinkie to be able to afford the accessories and decorations, </em>
<p></p>which cost how much? versus how much she makes? can't answer that? then can't say it's ludicrous she can afford it.
<p></p><em> be able to set up a tent at any random part in town,  and somehow do this all herself and near-instantly so it can be sprung as a joke.</em>
<p></p>and you know this how? how do you know she set it up in a random part of town? that she did it herself and dind't have help? that it wasn't something she'd been doing awhile and Twi just never heard of it?
<p></p><em>Oh,  and then a random brick just happens to fall on Twilight's head,  which even Pinkie admits is impossible.</em>

<p></p>Yes the pony who was suffering from a concussion,  massive sleep deprivation,  nd hyper-stressed should have know better......She brought Pinkie because Pinkie happened to be there at the time and as above,  she WASN'T thinking straight.

            Pinkie is in that 'not my favorite but likeable' status for me. I agree some of her non sequitur comments and over the topness get rather obnoxious at times,  she seems like a character created intensionally for memes,  however there is enough of her that is endearing and genuinely funny to like.
<p></p>@Moe: <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> is often demonized,  sometimes it's bad,  but it does lay some potential for a show. For example it was <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> that made shows like Ren And Stimpy or Family Guy more sentimental and light hearted compared to their later shock value years. If executive meddling hadn't demanded another story for the first <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRailwaySeries" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRailwaySeries">The Railway Series</a> novel,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThomasAndFriends" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThomasAndFriends">Thomas And Friends</a> may not exist.
<p></p>Granted I heard some bad things about the show and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> on it's page,  eg. the Derpy scandal,  and a supposed Big Mac episode that didn't make the cut.

            It wasn't a brick,  it was a flowerpot,  and if Pinkie's tent was close enough to another building,  it may have gotten knocked out of an above window (like in "The Mysterious Mare Do Well").

            further,  so Pinkie is random? She is only EVER used so for pure <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> comedy,  never as a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>,  it's made lcear over and over that no pony understands WTF she's doing or how,  they've just learned to roll with it instead of always wasting time trying to question it.
<p></p>I LOVE when shes doing that,  they pretty much captured the feel of the Classic <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooneyTunes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a>,  and I and a lot of other people love it.
<p></p>Wil everyone,  no,  should everyone,  no,  but it's no reason to always set out to find the worst possible light to view her in. There is far far more to her then JUST the jokes as we've seen in every one of her episodes,  so why get upset at them using her to inject a bit of extra humor while bringing up some excellent nostalgia for some classics.

            I do agree it's hardly as if the other characters don't do highly cartoony stuff every now and then. AJ and Rainbow Dash basically revert to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoadRunnerVsCoyote" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoadRunnerVsCoyote">Road Runner vs. Coyote</a> antics in Fall Weather Friends,  while <em>everyone</em> is an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey">Iron Butt Monkey</a>.

            Yeah,  I <em>really</em> don't think Pinkie's being pushed from what she was in season one. Heck,  one of the defining moments in AFID was when Pinkie is talking to Twilight and Rainbow Dash about Cranky,  and they <em>straight up tell her</em> what her problem is. This is then immediately followed with Pinkie still not getting it,  and Twilight face-desking. In It's About Time,  she had that little "is anypony going to panic with me?" bit near the beginning,  and everyone else just gives her weird looks. The town <em>does</em> react realistically to her (so long as there isn't a musical number going on).
