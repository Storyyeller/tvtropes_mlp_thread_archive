            @Starscream: More practically,  she thinks that because
<p></p>1. all of her friends are blatantly lying to her to get out of coming to her party
<p></p>2. they're throwing a party without her
<p></p>3. Spike <em>explicitly tells her</em> that they don't want to be her friends anymore because he misunderstood Pinkie's question.
<p></p>As noted,  Pinkie's self-esteem is pretty much directly tied to how happy she can make everyone.  If she thinks that they dislike her parties,  she basically loses her motivation for living.

            @Seraphem: It's still in early planning stages. I considered making it a oneshot,  but I think tree chapters is most likely at this point (that may change though).
<p></p>Of course,  I have other ideas as well that are curently at a higher priority level. I'm still working on Star Swirl and Stripes Forever. Also coming up:
<p></p><strong>A Debt to the Stars:</strong> "The stars will aid in her escape." That was the agreement. But Nightmare Moon did not live up to her end of the bargain. Now,  the ponies she raised have escaped from the stars and want vengeance. So they break out and raise another of Celestia's relatives. One who was hated by his relatives far beyond what Nightmare Moon ever was. Morning Star.
<p></p><strong>The Last Use of Antlers:</strong> It is the most important festival of the cervids,  with the largest ceremony deep in Deerope attended by representatives of all races and competed in by members of cervid tribes from around the world. And this year,  Star Swirl,  Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash have been chosen to attend as representatives of Equestria.
<p></p><strong>A Talon in Diplomacy:</strong> Star Swirl has requested to be sent to the Gryphon Kingdom as part of a diplomatic entourage. But when tragedy strikes,  it will take all her skill to prevent a diplomatic incident from escalating to catastrophic levels.
<p></p><strong>The Moulds of Opposition:</strong> One of Star Swirl's old enemies has allied with other enemies of Equestria. Their plan? To recruit six very special ponies and forge a set of artifacts with power rivalling that of the Elements of Harmony themselves. Should their plan succeed,  they will have their revenge and Equestria will fall from it's height as a superpower in misery and chaos.
<p></p>(I can't reveal who the vilians of The Moulds of Opposition are because SPOILAZ! (No,  seriously MAJOR spoilers.))

            <div class="quoteblock"> It really depends on which comics you're reading. The first two arcs definitely had some character material (although it wasn't the driving force of the plot),  and most of the micro comics are entirely character-driven.</div>
<p></p>I will say that later comics improved after the first arc (which honestly left a very poor first impression on me). But even then in general the comics feel too OTT in general and the characters too thin for my taste (yes,  even in their specific stories).

            I really enjoyed the latest comic too,  as it's a good humorous light hearted funny story packed full of sight gags.
<p></p>My gala dress AJ isn't doing too well though.  And no one wanted any commissions.  Sigh.  Well,  maybe I should get back to Flights Of Fancy soon.

I would recommend working on your comic,  it is such a great idea and you've put so much wrk in it already,  I really want to see it happen,  plus it'll help get more people to notice you.

            @Mio: I actually think the first arc is still my favorite,  but to each his own,  I guess.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">This show needs more vikings.  Although I think they should be steers,  so they can do a joke where they wear the stereotypical horned helmets,  but then it turns out that the horns are real and protrude through holes in the helmets.

<p></p>Yes,  I AM using that for inspiration. But the different cervid tribes are not all identical. And they are not <em>fully</em> viking. They also have a bit of other stuff thrown in. Including a touch of Christmas elf (one of their Cosmics is the verse's equivalent of Santa).

<p></p>Anyway,  it's called The Last use of Antlers because the festival takes place right before they shed their antlers,  when they are at the height of their power. As such,  it's considered a time to make important decisions,  celebrate,  show off and compete with one another. The representatives of other races are largely their to be impressed and to act as judges.
<p></p>Dngerous Business and the Lunaverse are also sources of inspiration for the cervids of this verse,  though,  again,  they're diverse.

            Hello,  all
Sorry I've been gone for a while,  but,  I have some updates: finished season one and am now moving onto season two:
Episodes one and two of Season two,  I was laughing alot because finally something bad is happening to the cast. I love how they're all being switched around and hating eachother and being turned against one another,  it's pretty great.
I also really dig Vinyl Scratch and Octavia,  I've read some fanfics that were pretty good and they're cool characters. Half wish there were more about them in the shows.
After seeing "a party for one, " I could really see Pinky going crazy and running the Ministry of moral in FOE,  FOE: PH.
Still laughing at the fact these are ponies,  but,  getting past that,  it's pretty amusing,  good for some laughs.

<p></p>That's a strange statement. No,  not the laughter,  but the implication that nothing bad has happened to them before.

            @Blind Bard: Well if you're going to use that standard. . .well frankly nothing bad ever happens to any one in this series. I don't even think the Discord stuff even gets to that level of bad.

            hahahahahaha,  nope,  I will admit,  though,  going from FOE,  FOE-PH,  is very amusing to pair voices with the names. Nothing really bad happens,  but pairing the voices and seeing the humor is pretty funny.

            okay seen it,  in much higher quality too.
<p></p>As to that last one,  no she doesn't come back. It's been pretty much agreed on that it makes zero sense for that to happen,  and the entire scene makes no sense if Luna was talking to Twilight,  but perfect sense if she's talking to Celestia. This isn't HMM coming back,  this is Twi reliving Celestia's memories of Luna's original fall. Given it's coded as being in episode 1,  odds are it's part of her learning to be a Princess,  seeing just what she has to watch out for,  seeing just what made Luna snap so she can avoid it.
