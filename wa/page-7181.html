<p></p>well,  I'd suggest we see about a body swap spell Lyra,  but other then the human&lt;-&gt;pony conversion,  the Male&lt;-&gt;female might be a BIT much.

<p></p>I can love the characters with all my heart,  but they alone would not have kept me reading FOE (at least not initially)
<p></p>With FOE I had Red Eye and The Goddess to look forward to. With Project Horizons I have... nothing

            I just think it sounds way to Grim dark. The whole point of FO:E was that no matter how dark it is,  the smallest candle of hope can clear a path through it. PH just seems like what weird twisted crap can we do to them next.

            Project Horizons is what happens when you take the hope away from FOE and find out that even with all the hope gone,  there's still somehow a little left over.

            @ Seraphem: Yes,  there is still hope there,  it's just that the author is taking the time honored approach of "push the characters until they break to show what they're made of" and turning it up to eleven. As for retconning,  it's a fanfic of a fanfic,  so it's about as different from the original as the original is from the show. You can call it retconning or you can call it worldbuilding.

            You're freaking out and contradicting yourself every other post,  Ginger. What do you want us to do? First you get angry for wanting to drop the story because there's no anchor for you,  then you get angry because you are now stuck with the story,  but can't drop it because you're too invested. You can't lash out at the people here for that,  they didn't do anything.

            @Perpetual What I mean by stuck is that I don't want my experience of the FOE world to end. I've grown to love it too much.
<p></p>I'm invested with a god damned SETTING. But there are no other stories WITHIN that setting that even have a hope of grabbing me but Project Horizons
