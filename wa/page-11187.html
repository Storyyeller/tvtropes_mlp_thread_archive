            I'm especially disillusioned because with this place because I expected a place like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropes">TV Tropes</a> to provide good critique considering the sort of site it is.

            @Blue Aside from struggling with greed in the face of easily obtainable shiny objects (which isn't something you just <em>learn</em> to get over,  and has to always be actively resisted),  what mistakes does Rarity repeat over and over again? I can't think of any. She's (IMO) one of the best developed characters in the cast.

            @Blue Okay,  missed Sonic Rainboom,  but Green is Not Your Color's conflict was caused by Rarity hiding her feelings and encouraging Fluttershy,  not her selfishness (which she kept entirely in check). Best Night Ever was about overblown expectations. Secret of My Excess was not about Rarity nearly at all,  no focus whatsoever is giver to her struggling with selfishness,  and she was not portrayed as being in the wrong at any point in the episode. My point still stands.

<p></p>But she is generous. Remember the time she worked her plot off making free dresses for everyone,  and then made a whole new set at their request even though it risked her career? What about the time she volunteered to be a test subject for an unknown spell in order to help Rainbow Dash? Or the time she gave Twilight her umbrella while it was raining?

            Really,  that contrast is why I like her character so much.  She's unambiguously generous (you don't over to make dresses for all your friends free of charge if you aren't),  but she still struggles with her own desires.  I think it makes her one of the most well-rounded characters.  Goodness knows I struggle with stuff even though I actually know better.  Like Perpetual said,  you don't just "get over" something like that.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">She's both generous and selfish. And what makes her interesting is that unlike most of the cast,  she has to actively try to live up to her element rather than just naturally being like that.  Like AJ is just naturally honest,  Fluttershy is naturally nice,  etc.  Rarity is selfish but she knows it and tries not to be.  That's why she qualifies to be the element of generosity.
<p></p>@Mousa: Writing,  and writing fanfiction differ only in subject matter.  The only appreciable difference is that in fanfic you have a framework to work within,  and in original work you have to create the framework yourself.

            Some flaws never leave,  but sometimes they do. I mean,  what's the point of personal development if you can't actually eliminate some of your bad points?

            I'm not sure if you can ever <em>eliminate</em> them,  only become aware of them and account for them.  And in context of the show,  it's kinda impossible that she'll never fully eliminate that aspect of her character; it's too much a defining point of her personality.  If this were a more continuity-heavy series,  yeah,  I'd expect her to get over it,  but given that the episodes are largely standalone,  you can't change up the personality that much.

            @J Teeth,  i know,  it's a thing I'm getting over,  I have a whole childhood I'm trying to distance myself from,  I can't stand to look back at all that stuff I tried to write within the frame work of other universes when there is so much more freedom and opportunity for publishing in doing it yourself. Besides,  one of my curses back in the day was making a whole crowd of original characters in the old universe,  that considering fanfiction seemed even more pointless.
<p></p>I mean when I was little I thought I was going to be the maker of the next Digimon season. I cannot look at the very idea of fanfiction without thinking about how stupid and delusional I was. DBZ: The new Crew,  Shaman King: America,  Pokemon: The freaking Zodiac league...
