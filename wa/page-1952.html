            Ah yes,  Blueblood... classy as always.
<p></p>There's always this explanation: the citizens of Ponyville just found out about the Elements after Discord was defeated (since,  as people said,  the celebration after the Nightmare Eclipse was largely for Luna),  and they had already known five of the six Bearers for years - and,  by Discord,  they'd known Twilight for about a year as well.  So the Ponyvillans knew them as themselves,  not as heroes - the girls behind the gems,  as it were.  As for Canterlot... was it ever shown that anywhere other than Ponyville had been chaos'd?  (Aside from Canterlot Keep,  that is).  If the effect had been localized in a small,  rural village,  I can see the nobility forgetting about it rather quickly - especially if they were then told that,  essentially,  these six <em>farm ponies</em> were of more use to the country than they ever were.

            So Canterlot is more like an upper-crust (Haw,  that's somepony's name!) Britain,  instead of a Manhattan,  high society scene.  Makes sense,  given how its name comes from an English kingdom.

            What are clothes in this universe,  really? Seeing 90% of the Canterlotians walking around in clothes makes me think that it's a status symbol but no one ever comments on Rarity's lack of clothes - in fact it's Dash who has something to say about wearing fancy clothes.

            Yeah. I'm guessing Canterlot = Camelot = capitol = fancy (even though Camelot was arthurian,  so probably not that fancy - seeing ponies of the round table would be awesome,  BTW),  wheras trottingham = nottingham = rural.
<p></p>As for the fame issue,  I'm going to go with the 'not well publiscized' theory. The discord issue was reolved within a day,  as was the NNM event. Both of them would hae been noticable,  yeah,  but there are lots of reasons news wouldn't have spread far. The six could have requested it didn't go far. It might have never been specified who they were. They could have let the guards or the princess take the credit. It may even simply be that they were heard of,  but simply not recognized. Granted the names are all pretty unique,  but someone doesn't go around fluffing themselves up it's hard to tell if they're famous or just another face in the crowd.
<p></p>Personally,  my theory is that Equestrians like to just let certain unpleasant issues fall into the past. A gigantic,  historical event concerning one of their princesses became an old wive's tail,  after all,  and most ponies had never even heard of a zebra. "Equestrians live with blinders on their borders". If it doesn't concern them,  or they don't like it,  they seem content to just forget about it entirely. Which is... fairly unsettling,  as cultures go.

            By always giving them something to do.
<p></p>But yeah Mousa,  think about it. Isn't it just a little bit creepy when you give it more thought? Upper crust ponies don't even know what a <em>rooster</em> is? Very important aspects of their history have fallen in to myth despite the fact that someone who was there is still around to tell it? I don't <em>really</em> give credence to celestyranny,  and I'm disinclined to make the series proper dark,  but if it really is willful ignorance it's just sort of unsettling.

            Indeed,  it's almost like a mask,  or some sort of overly saccharine state of mind they maintain and negativity is ignored. And in some way,  I'm not even sure how much Celestia cares,  I mean what exactly is she doing in terms of international relations and national education if her rednecks can't tell what a zebra is and her nobility can nary identify poultry?
<p></p>I can understand having her people trying to find things out for themselves,  learn how to handle themselves and in many ways they seem to have,  but in other ways they do not. I mean the town's ignorance of what Zecora was was what gave me the impression that Twilight was the only person in town that actually <em>used</em> the library.
