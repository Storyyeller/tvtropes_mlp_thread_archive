            I dunno Apple,  seemed to me like the Ticket was kinda cut-and-dry. I mean,  presumably if they gave you a ticket for not having a seatbelt,  you didn't have a seatbelt on... plus if you were rude to her,  that probably won't be terribly in your favour... especially since the ticket is only 45 dollars,  if it were me I honestly wouldn't bother. You might want to make sure you're completely calm before you make that decision.
<p></p>Also,  I think the way in which Rarity is generous can easily be understated by people who don't put the same emphasis on style and fashion as she does. After all,  she's pretty much dedicated her life to making ponies look good,  which given her mindset is a pretty generous goal I'd think. And it's not like she won't take any chance to give somepony a makeover even aside from that.

            What was that saying?  Rarity is always willing to give unconditionally,  but what <em>she</em> thinks a pony needs,  not what they actually need?  Give,  but not give in?

<p></p>I'll see what tomorrow and a finished final essay will bring.  I think it's hurt feelings at being punished whilst doing a good deed.  That and I got attitude from her right off the bat and responded in kind.

            @Dark: The problem is that "inspiration" doesn't really fit thematically with the other elements. All the others are elements that are defined on interactions between people. Inspiration isn't really a social virtue.
<p></p>And I would say that Rarity probably is quite generous in that she's very willing to give up large amounts of time and effort when she doesn't really need to.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Yeah,  that's pretty much it. She's willing to give a lot,  but often she doesn't know what she should be giving,  so she defaults to "I'll give them what I'd want."

            Which is just like Pinkie's problem.  She wants you to be happy,  but sticks with what makes her happy,  not you.  In both cases,  the heart is in the right place,  but it's not well thought out.

            @Badwolf: Her friends were the only ones who mentioned money. If that line actually means anything (rather then just being another generic example of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>) it seems more likely that they insisted on paying anyway,  for some reason.

            I took it more as (if it wasn't simply a line added to the song which didn't apply to the real events) that she gave them each a certain budget for their dresses. It wasn't costing them anything as long as they stayed under a certain amount.

Between <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a>,  the comics,  and potentially EQG it already has three continuities within itself,  so you are not wrong.

<p></p>What I mean is (although this has been traditionally viewed as a bad thing) that you could take the mane six and make almost any show you want.  We have mane six as humans in high school now.  We could have mane six in Space...mane six in...something else.
