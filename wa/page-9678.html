<p></p>(I'm almost tempted to ask if a succubus was involved,  if only because they were associated with sleep paralysis,  if I remember correctly,  which I sometimes don't.)

            Eh. I would think an out-of-body experience when completely and utterly tired but unable to sleep is more creepy.
<p></p>It gets creepier,  if somewhat reassuring,  when Death asks you "<span class="asscaps">What are you doing out here? You've still got sand in your lifetimer. Ugh,  please don't say that it is an out of body experience,  I keep getting that these days.</span>"
<p></p>Sleep paralysis,  I don't get that any more since I can manually break my dreamstate and lift the motor control disconnect.

<p></p>And yeah,  I tend to bottle up stuff deep down,  so I can see how Fluttershy could be doing the same. It doesn't seem she had a particularly great childhood either.

            Fluttershy <em>might</em> be older than Applejack,  but the fact that Applejack was last in her class to get her cutie mark makes this less likely. Also,  we know that Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy weren't in the same class as when Rainbow claimed that she was first in her class to earn her cutie mark,  she had no way of knowing that Fluttershy didn't earn her's first.

            Huh,  I just found some interesting fanon about the animals in Ponyville. You know how the animals in the Canterlot gardens in 'The Grand Galloping Gala' acted like normal animals,  instead of the sentient ones elsewhere? This fanon says that years of interaction with ponies can caused some of the magic that the ponies have to slowly,  over generations,  diffuse from the ponies to the animals,  causing them to gain sentience. This is why Livestock,  which would have been domesticated since the start of Pony civilisation,  are able to talk,  while animals that interact less,  but still live in proximity to ponies for whatever reason,  seem to have a lesser form of sentience,  though different species take different amounts of time to gain sentience. The ones in the gardens were stated to be exotic animals,  and therefore wouldn't have much interaction with ponies.
<p></p>I actually have an idea to add to this,  that it's not ponies that are the source of the magic,  but another species that have had heavy influence by this magical leakage. It's something else that creates sentience,  it just resides around where ponies first come from. That just makes more sense to me,  but then what is the source of this magic? The Elements Of Harmony? The Everfree Forest? The Alicorns? Space Giants?

            Yeah,  it was kind of totally terrifying. Imagine you <em>know</em>,  in spite of everything,  that there is something in your room with you,  that more than likely has harming you in mind,  and all you need to do to get rid of it is just to be able to move a little bit - but you <em>can't</em>. Most I could do was shift a little,  so I ended up straining and rocking back and forth to try and wake myself the rest of the way up.
<p></p>Also it's funny you should mention succubi: there wasn't a succubus,  but there was an <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rowthree.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/ink-promo.jpg">Incubus.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small>

            @Cookoo: We should study the geology (or an energy map) of Equestria. It's likely there's a powerful force (Living and Intelligent?) that uplifted the ponies,  and the uplifting is contagious and spreads to the other fauna.
<p></p>For me it's less sleep paralysis and more "ugh too tired going back to sleep."

            @Applelight: Yeah,  I'm okay. Incidental sleep paralysis like this isn't really a health issue,  just something going kinda wonky. In my case it's basically that I was just falling asleep and I decided I didn't want to. So I remained aware while I slipped into REM.
<p></p>Freaky as hell,  but not dangerous. I'm... still a touch on edge,  but I'm fine. Thanks,  though.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">It's not PAINFUL,  per se. I put a lot of effort into moving,  so I strained myself pretty good,  but never to the point of hurting. It's paralysis,  so you simply can't move.

            Sometimes when I nap on the couch,  I experience the symptoms of sleep paralysis,  but I don't see anything particularly scary. But it only happens when I'm drifting in and out of sleep.
