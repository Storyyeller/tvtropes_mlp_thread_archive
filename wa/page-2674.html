            I still think that it's more a case of recent episodes just focusing on her bad side.  Part of the reason <a class="urllink" href="http://japaneseteeth.deviantart.com/#/d4k8o8u">I called RD the pony that got it the worst this season<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is because she's just been portrayed badly this season.  I have no doubt that she's a good pony,  and that she's not always a jerk,  it's just that this season's episodes seem to focus on that side of her personality.  Sort of like if you followed a normal person around with a camera and edited out a lot of them being nice but left most of the jerkish stuff in.
<p></p>I'm all for giving characters flaws,  but with RD the two problems are 1. the episodes are so focused on the flaws that they make her look bad and 2. the flaws themselves are active rather than passive,  they come about as a result of choices on RD's part rather than being a part of her personality.
<p></p>It's part of why I think <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonicRainboom" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonicRainboom">Sonic Rainboom</a> did a much better job with her personality; it made her flawed,  but not in a way that made her look horrible.  You could sympathize with her more.

            If over used,  or turned into a conviniant <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuesExMachina" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuesExMachina">Dues Ex Machina</a> sure. but it hasn't been. So RD is one of the best fliers ever,  so what,  she's still an interesting character. How many episodes have been about RD being better then everyone? One,  Sonic Rainboom,  which even then,  yeah she did something every-pony thought was impossible,  but it's made clear she was almost paralized with fear before hand,  it wasn't a casual,  "Oh time to go be the best,  so bored"
<p></p>The others you may mention,  nope they were about her WANTING to be the best at something,  not her ACTUALLY being the best,  which that right there,  the fact that she more often wants to be doing better at something then she is,  invalidates the whole,  "It's boring because she's the best" argument,  if she was that good,  there'd never be a time when she wanted to be better.
<p></p>Yeah she's brash,  she over confident,  but we have seen time and time again that the majority of that is just a mask she uses to hide her deep sense of insecurity,  she does NOT,  at the core of her being,  believe she is as good as she acts like she is. Her constant showboating and glory hogging is as much to try and quite that tiny voice in her head telling her she's not good enough as it is just being a glory hound. Sure she likes the praise and all either way,  but it's the fact there is complexity under that facade that makes her still interesting.
<p></p>And yes lately the writers haven't been doing a really good job of showing that,  but it is still there.

            The Weeping Angels never really bothered me too much.  I mean they are polite enough to trasport you back in time to live out your days,  at least.  Not exactly pleasant,  but there are worse ways to die.  cracks in the skin of the universe for example.

            @Mio It's weird. If a character is acting like a jerk and the POINT is that they're supposed to be acting like a jerk,  then I generally love it.
<p></p>Plus,  I don't sense any malice in RD's Jerkishness,  just her rampant ego.

She's gotten the short end of the stick this season,  which is why I'm excited about her upcoming episode.  I'm hoping it'll win back some sympathy for her after the other episodes.

            A lot of people talk about how flaws make a character great,  but I think that to certain extent they miss the point. Yes a flaws make a character seem more real and relateble,  on the other hand they make for very good reasons for why we shouldn't like them. I always look at a character's flaws as their potential to grow and become stronger. If that potential isn't tapped in some way and the character remains static then he seizes to be interesting and becomes grating (admittedly this is not always the case).
<p></p>That is kind of the problem with RD. We see her learn lessons,  but to be honest do you think she really changed at all? MMDW was most egregious about this,  which is sad because i think it did more to develop her then people think. Like J Teeth said they have been really focusing on her negative traits,  mostly because they make for great comedic devices,  but at the expense of her supposed good traits and the impression that she is capable of change at all.
