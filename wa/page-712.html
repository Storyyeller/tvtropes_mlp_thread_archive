            The purpose of ponies dressing up is kind of lost on me,  considering that they don't wear clothes normally anyway. How did the practice evolve? Doesn't the concept of ordinary clothing need to exist BEFORE the idea for formal attire comes about? How can they have one and not the other?
<p></p>Was there a period long ago when Equestria went through a phaze of ponies wearing everyday clothing,  but the craze eventually died out,  leaving the upper-class fashion industry as the only thing popular enough about pony clothing to survive until the present day?

It isn't necessary,  but you might put some on for special occasions or just to look good.  Fancy clothing probably evolved from more practical clothes used in colder climates.

            Remember the pony who had the 80's fashion? Perhaps clothing was a fad back then.
<p></p>Also,  ponies are already covered in fur. So the need to wear clothes as a means to stay warm isn't as necessary as it is for humans. Second,  the ponies don't seem to condemn the idea of nudity like we do.

            Rarity said she was just fixing up her duds,  so I guess Applejack's gala outfit is just a fancier version of her work clothes?  So,  um,  a saddle,  a hat,  and some boots.  Why would she need a saddle while working?

            This is somewhat along the lines of the current conversation,  I was just having dinner when it occurred to me why Equestria has such <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a>.
<p></p>Basic logic dictates that since Equestria doesn't have the same history and development as earth,  it shouldn't have the same technology. Some of it would carry over,  and certain things would likely be invented the same,  albeit in perhaps different forms. This is,  of course,  because different cultures have different needs - while beds have existed everywhere,  they take different forms in every region,  and western europe never invented something similar to the rice flail because it was not possible to grow rice. And this is the key point here: Different cultures have different needs. Not only do they have a different history,  when it comes down to it Equestria has a <em>radically</em> different from anywhere on earth,  by virtue of literal divine protection. For all the dangers in Equestria,  the citizens are very safe,  and the country peaceful. Necessity,  as they say,  is the mother of invention,  and much modern technology originated from weapons technology (The atomic bomb was the first example of what atoms could do,  for example). But Equestria never needed weapons,  so they missed out on a lot of that. So,  where does their necessity come from,  then? It comes from ponies,  of course! Ponies who want to do things that they just can't with current technology,  need to invent tech of their own! That's why certain fields like music have excelled to modern standards,  while other fields like travel didn't - who needs cars when you have pegasi carts?
Their are other parts of it too. Like,  Equestrians seem to know very little of the world outside their kingdom,  and have little desire to - so they wouldn't have invented a television,  which was meant to improve global communication,  instead settling for radio,  which can only be broadcast locally anyways. The parts of technology that don't make sense,  like hammers,  may have been introduced by dexterous outsiders like griffons,  or the rare visitor that does need them. I can imagine ponies wanting to have technology for the sake of having it,  but their culture is extremely inclusive,  it seems,  so if they don't invent technology themselves,  someone needs to bring it to them for it to perpetuate at all,  and that's very rare.
