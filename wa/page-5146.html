            I'm still trying to understand exactly why you think Twilight is so overpowered when every other pony has shown just as much or more competence in their area of expertise,  and why it makes any difference in a show where power levels don't really factor into the plot most of the time.
<p></p>I feel like we're working off of vastly different definitions of "overpowered".

            Ok,  she isn't OP in the context of THIS show,  fair enough,  I can see that. (I love Twi when she ISN'T using magic) but she WOULD be if this were a shonen series.
<p></p>Why would you write a character that could be OP under ANY context? What does it add? What does Twi being RIDICULOUSLY powerful add?

<p></p>Because the implication is that with magic,  twilight could also match them in their own areas but they could never match her in her's. (I think)

            There is nothing wrong with having characters overpowered,  so long as it doesn't break the show. There is no set rule for this sort of thing.
<p></p>As Kegisak pointed out,  RD broke the sound barrier. That would be far more OP than anything Twi can do. Teleport all you want,  it won't do you any good if RD can mash you into a fine pulp in the time it takes you to lift your head to activate your horn.
<p></p>Plus,  if Twi was OP,  she would have easily solved half the problems on the episode. Lava pit? Anti lava field. King of the hill? Give Spike temp super strength. There is WAY more Twi could do. OP she is not.

            @Ginger: Okay,  wait,  so now you're saying that your problem is that Twilight could be,  in some context outside of this show,  overpowered?  That's entirely true that she could be,  but I have no idea why you think it's a bad thing that she <em>could</em> be overpowered in a different context <em>that she wasn't written for in the first place?</em>
<p></p>That's like complaining that Superman is overpowered because if you put him in a <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuddyCop" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuddyCop">Buddy Cop</a> movie he could end the plot too quickly.
<p></p>Also,  what AHR said.  It only matters if she's OP <em>in this show</em>.
<p></p>@L Mage: That's what I thought too,  but that's blatantly not the case.  Twilight is never going to be as good at fashion as Rarity,  as good of a flier as Rainbow Dash,  as good as a Farmer as AJ,  etc.

            @ Ginger,  trying to make sure a character isn't OP under any cicumsatnce is insane,  it would never work,  any unicorn would be OP if put into a serious without magic,  you can't make a story while trying to make sure it compies to stuff from complaetly un-realted worlds,  you just can't. All you have to worry about it how the character works in the context of the story your writing.

            She isn't overpowered at magic any more than AJ is "overpowered" at farming!  I still don't get <em>why you're saying she's overpowered when she isn't any more good at what she does than the rest of the cast is.</em>
<p></p>Magic is her special talent.  Of course she's going to be good at it.  And I still don't understand why you think that's a bad thing.

<p></p>Still,  it'd have been nice if they had <em>fought</em> the fragons somehow. Couldn't Twilight use "Calm Crowd" on them? Or make herself a Biotic Shield? Or something?
<p></p>Also,  I'm introducing a friend to MLP. Which episodes should I recommend her? The Elements of Harmony plus Dragonshy,  maybe? What do you suggest?

<p></p>If Twi solved all the problems,  I could understand,  but here we see a simple power being taken to a logical conclusion,  and isn't really all that useful,  in the context of the show.

            Being a equatorfag meant that I didn't know daylight savings time just ended,  and only realised that when the latest episode aired an hour earlier.
<p></p>The good news? New episodes now air at 1 am!
<p></p>The bad news? There are now only a month's worth of episodes left for the season,  followed by a half-year long episode drought.
<p></p>And yes,  I unknowingly started following the series just after the first season 2 two-parter just aired.

            Ginger: Twilight's magic (which you keep saying is overpowered,  but others have already refuted your arguments,  so what makes you keep clinging to this now that there's nothing to support it?) adds the same thing Applejack's incredible strength,  stamina and very competent agility does: talents to flesh out a character.

            @Handle: Dragonshy is a pretty popular introductory episode.  Good plotting and includes the entire cast.
<p></p>@Preview: Nice.  This is going to be interesting...
<p></p>@Parrot: Have you posted here before?  If not,  welcome.  Don't mind the arguing,  it'll probably blow over relatively soon.

            depends what your freind likes. Dragonshy,  Lesson Zero,  Return Of Harmony,  would be my choices.
<p></p>@ Ginger,  except she's not OP at magic,  her spells fail just as much as they help,  yes she has the most powerful TK we've seen,  but raw power does not = OP,  rarity clearly has less raw power,  but much finer control and can simultaneously manipulate more objects at once then we've seen Twi do.
