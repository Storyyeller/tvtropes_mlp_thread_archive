            @Ginger That's actually a huge plot point in Black/White. Team Plasma is more or less an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalWrongsGroup" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalWrongsGroup">Animal Wrongs Group</a>,  and their leader is in it to see all pokemon free from humans. The game doesn't paint them as being completely wrong,  either,  at least not at first.

            @Chada  How can capturing animals and forcing them to fight (even teachign kids to do this) can be even justified,  even worse that those animal where closer in level of sentience to human than  our animals.

            I'm not far yet,  they seem to believe in what they're doing and I almost do,  it's just some of their members are <em>idiots</em>.
<p></p>I mean what fools decide to kick and abuse a pokemon for its spores when their entire purpose is to leave the critters alone and let them be free?
<p></p>I mean I get they have pokemon and would logically set them free after they defended themselves. That's what N seems to do since,  if you notice,  everytime you tassle with him he's only using pokemon from the local area,  he isn't carrying them,  he's calling on his animal friends from nearby.

            they are hyposcrites,  they use pokemon to fight,  but they keep saying that as soon as they hve freed all the other pokemon in the world from humans (aka stolen everyone pokemon,  weather they use them to battle or as pets,  or actaul companions) they will realses there own.

            @Death Cloud: Live action writers tend to be more vivid in writing 'realistic' characters and making humans that are still kind of vivid and interesting to watch. Cartoon writers tend to distance their humans from their wacky critters by making the humans as boring and normal as possible while the critters are usually one note comic relief. The worse of two worlds really.
<p></p>I think cartoon writers have a more mundane view of what makes characters 'realistic'.

            @Ginger The grunts use pokemon they "liberated" from other trainers,  with the stated goal of letting them go once they've liberated all of the pokemon.
<p></p>Their <em>leader</em>,  though,  is in no way a hypocrite. In each of your battles with him,  he has a completely different party,  all comprised of wild pokemon local to the area that he <em>asked nicely</em> to fight for him.
