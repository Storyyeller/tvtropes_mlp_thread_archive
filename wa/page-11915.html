<p></p>On this day,  2.2 million soldiers,  pilots,  militiaponies,  and National Guardsponies died defending their homeland from an evil threat. They disobeyed retreat orders,  called in airstrikes on their own overrun positions and when they ran out of bullets,  they flipped their rifles around and started using them as clubs.
<p></p>Never in the history of Equestria,  was such sacrifice asked of its soldiers.
<p></p>You did your job.

            Changelings actually didn't inflict any Equestrian casulties,  they took all prisoner for later feeding.
<p></p>Shiny later used his Barrier to detect alll the changelings. Sadly Blueblood was the real deal.

            Those were glue guns,  not lasers.
<p></p>Changelings have had a lifetime of espionage and silent takedowns and hunger to get careless and accidentally kill their prey.

            That doesn't really work when 1) all of the locals can TK you before you hit the ground (or before you jump,  even),  and 2) both your wife... and,  um,  other wife... have wings and 3) possibly also have telekinesis.

<p></p>That was one of the fan comics that came out right afterward.  The bellhop welcomes them to their honeymoon suite with this really sleazy wink wink nudge nudge,  Shining and Cadence walk to the bed and give each other a really saucy look,  then just pass the fuck out.
