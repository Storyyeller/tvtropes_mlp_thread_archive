            Unless he was MIA,  I don't think it'd warrant that level of emotional reaction from the rest of the ponies present. I mean,  even Cherilee's tearing up. If he were just coming back from overseas deployment I don't think it'd warrant interrupting class.

            I'm with Lurker. I especially appreciate the lesson of the episode: that sometimes the best way to be a friend is to leave someone alone.

            I'm with badwolf on this one.  Pinkie had her moments,  but on the whole I found her more aggravating than anything else.  And as I've said before,  I'm fine with her having flaws; my issue with that episode is that I never felt like she actually understood the lesson because she got what she wanted without ever actually giving Cranky his space.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I agree that the lesson was great,  but I didn't at all get the feeling that Pinkie ever demonstrated that she learned it because <em>she never actually left Cranky alone until after he agreed to be her friend</em>.  I thought it had a great message,  but kinda shot itself in the foot because in function Pinkie didn't actually do it.  If the episode had ended with Pinkie leaving him alone,  and him giving her a second chance because of it,  it would probably be one of my favorite episodes.

            The best lessons are the ones the characters figure out on their own.  It falls a little flat when they basically need to be told what they should learn from the episode.  That's one of Rarity's better features actually.

            @Blue: Yeah,  I didn't find that funny at all because if I were in his place,  I would have probably called the cops on her after she broke into my house.
<p></p>Also,  yes,  she reunited him with his lost love,  but it doesn't change the fact that she didn't actually act on the lesson,  ever.  Basically,  here's my problem with the episode:
<p></p>The intended message is "some people need to be given they're personal space".  That's great; I like that message.  The episode attempts to demonstrate this message by showing Pinkie meddling in Cranky's life,  and basically making him hate her because she never respects his privacy.  That's fine,  too.  Here's the problem:
<p></p>The message of the episode is that you can't force someone to be your friend by inserting yourself into their life all the time.  But <em>Pinkie becomes Cranky's friend by doing exactly that</em>.  She never,  at any point in the episode,  stops meddling in his personal affairs.  She <em>says</em> she will (only because Twilight tells her too)... and promptly goes right back to bothering him.  The conflict isn't resolved through her leaving him alone,  it's resolved by her finding a way to continue to meddle in a way that's beneficial for him.
<p></p>What <em>really</em> irks me about it that up until that point,  I loved how it was handling things. But then when she basically got away with bothering him into a friendship,  and I basically did this:

            She was literally seconds away from leaving him alone forever,  though. Unless you think Pinkie is lying,  she doesn't need to directly act on the lesson to demonstrate that she had learned it. She got lucky in the end,  but it doesn't diminish the rest of it.

            She was seconds away from leaving him forever and <em>didn't</em>.   She successfully completed what she was attempting the entire episode,  even though the entire point of the episode was to show that she shouldn't be doing that.  That's what bugs me; that the episode basically admitted that yeah,  her method works; you <em>don't</em> have to leave somebody alone if you can win them over otherwise.
