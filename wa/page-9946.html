<p></p>That's a funny way to spell Gilda. Also,  Octavia song announced? Now I see why there was an unusual number of posts today.

            I wasn't actually excited about a song between the two of them mostly for the reasons everyone said. I was more excited about the possibility of two of them interacting in any way and Octavia just appearing again.

            The Flim-Flam brothers got a song,  and they were only in one episode.  If Octavia does have a song,  it could be a story that focuses on her,  possibly her interactions with Rarity.
<p></p>Speaking of the Flim-Flams,  I was wondering last night if Applejack was at all aware that the cider they gave the other ponies to drink after the contest was the kind that had the trees smashed up in it.  Or if anyone besides the brothers was aware that the cider didn't look quite right or even notice that there were trees getting sucked into the machine.  If Applejack knew,  and said "go ahead and drink it" knowing that it would make the Flim-Flams look even worse,  that would be rather sneaky and dishonest of her (and rather out of character).  On the other hand,  if she didn't know,  the Apple family would end up having a big shock if they went out to that field and found big holes in the ground where the trees once were!
<p></p>Of all the things mentioned that might be hints of future stories,  I'm most curious about the idea of Fluttershy turning into a dragon.  Possible plot ideas that occurred to me:
<ul><li>She did it on purpose in an attempt to understand dragons better to help herself get over her fears.
</li><li>All the mane ponies get turned into things/creatures they dislike for some reason.
</li><li>All six of them get turned into dragons and maybe Spike gets turned into a pony.
</li><li>Fluttershy has a bodyswap with a dragon who isn't Spike.
</li></ul><p></p><p style="font-size:x-small;font-style:italic;">edited 13th Jul '12 4:57:37 PM by Rainbow</p><p></p>

<p></p>It means Rainbow Dash plays tricks Scootaloo,  thus 'fooling' her.
<p></p>And if you want an example of a good movie from a TV series,  how about Serenity?

            Oh,  of course,  there's no reason to over hype yourself. Some people just seem to take that too far and anti-hype themselves to counter it,  which takes all the fun out of things,  IMO. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            <div class="quoteblock">Hey guys,  I kinda need help deciding what game I should buy (from my wishlist,  Pannic,  I'm not interested in Thief) for the Steam Summer Sale. I kinda want to buy something that won't eat up too much of my $20 bucks,  since I also wanna buy Ocarina of Time. </div>
<p></p>What are the choices? Have you considered Achron?

            I showed my friend two episodes other then what I was originally going to show him. I showed him Swarm of the centuary and Lesson Zero. He's intreasted in the show and found those two episodes funny at least. He's not quite in the herd yet,  but he is intreasted in it at least.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
