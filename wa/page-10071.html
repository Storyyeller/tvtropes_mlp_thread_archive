            I think the initial Lauren Faust reasoning was to avoid the idea that girls shows are only about relationships. But this show is beyond all the stereotypes and prejudices at this point.

            They've had a whole two seasons with next to nothing being about relationships,  though,  and relationships <em>are</em> an important thing that lessons can be learned about. I'm not saying that the show <em>should</em> do it,  necessarily,  jut that it very easy <em>could</em> do it quite well,  IMO.

<p></p>I totally agree.  This show has defied all stereotypical conventions,  and I think it could totally do relationship plots well.  It is something that happens in real life,  and you can get a lot of story out of.
<p></p>Like,  pinkie wants to be a very special somepony for somepony,  but they don't like her that way.  Lesson is,  learning that sometimes its better to just stay friends.  Or FS trying to pluck up the courage to ask somepony out.  There's just so much potential.

            I think they could do it well,  but I'd still rather have it be a one-off episode rather than a recurring plot point.  Mainly because I like the way the show is now and I'd rather not have to deal with it coming up every few episodes.

            A relationship episode? I'm indifferent to the idea myself,  I think the creators can pull it off well,  but depending on how they do it,  it might raise problems in the fandom...

Not because it would necessarily be a bad thing,  but because that kind of subplot wouldn't really interest me.  I think if they do was a recurring romantic element,  they could give it to some of the side characters.  Like Big Macintosh and Cheerilee. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            I see a stallion wanting Pinkie for him,  and her being oblivious of that until her friends have to spell it for her. And now her,  friends of everyone,  is trying to deal with someone that wants to be more friend than the others.

            @JT It doesn't have to be a subplot or a plot point after the introduction. I just think that it would be a neat way to avert <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a> by having a relationship sticking. It doesn't have to be prominent,  just there. Having it happen with prominent side characters would work,  too.

            I have it floating in my personal fanon that Celestia and Luna rule with different styles. Celestia has a more subtle methodology,  while Luna's overt and blunt style stems from her personally leading her Night Guards.
<p></p>I also agree with a little role reversal as far as Pinkie goes,  having her being the quarry being stalked for a change would be amusing <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            Well,  yeah,  <em>nothing</em> is necessary. That's a given. I'm just talking about what I think would be nice to see,  and altering the group dynamics over the course of the show's lifespan would be a nice way to bring development and keep things fresh,  IMO.

            @ Perpetual: I'd like development as well,  but I'd just rather not do it by introducing a new character like that because I think that it would either change the status quo <em>too</em> much,  or else the new character would be too minor. I'd much rather have them change it up by maybe giving a character a new job or a new house or something That's just me though. We can agree to disagree. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">  It basically just comes down to the fact that I'm not that interested in seeing how the show would handle romance.  It wouldn't be a bad thing,  but on the list of things I'd like to see the show do,  that's pretty far down on the list.

            Who's the most likely amongst the Mane Six to change jobs anyway? My money's on Dashie (changing to something that primes her for Wonderbolt material),  Pinkie (moving out from the Cake family to give them room,  if she hasn't done that already),  and Twi (Expanding on her balloon or her astronomy,  having her shift out of Ponyville Library?).

<p></p>Yeah,  I'm  mostly thinking about ways that the group dynamics could be developed more. The characters get development themselves,  sure,  but as a team the dynamic there hasn't really changed since it solidified in Ticket Master.
<p></p>Other possibilities for group dynamic changes outside of love interests:
<p></p><ul><li>A character being temporarily <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>,  forcing the cast to adjust to not having them around.
<p></p></li><li>A lesson about leadership and when to take charge or when to listen (mostly because I thin it'd be cool to see RD and Twilight clash over leading the group).
</li></ul><p></p>And... yeah,  that's all I have off the top of my head. The second point is the only one that I think could actually happen in the show,  though.
<p></p>EDIT: A character having to take on additional responsibilities and dealing with that would also be neat.

            The best relationship development would be with another fully-developed character. And it would be gradual,  so much so that you can never really pick out a single point where the relationship started,  you just have that one point where they declare it to be official.
<p></p>But that's just me.

            An episode centered around flying with disagreements stemming from Twi's book knowledge on aeronautics and Dashie's practical flying talent could be interesting.

Rarity finally becomes something of a bigwig,  and the rest of the cast has to adjust to the fact that she's more successful than they are.)
<p></p>On another note,  I'd love to see an episode that deals with Pinkie having to move into her own place because Sugarcube Corner is too crowded,  and she has to learn to live on her own.

            @Ace: Twi will end up starting her own research company,  obviously.
<p></p>@JT: And of course,  Rarity will have to juggle between her career and friends,  hopefully without the whole 'you can only have one' condition. (Sweet and Elite' had the good sense not to play that straight.)
