<p></p><span class="blue">Chill out Nomuru,  everyone knows who you are.  The reason it seems like people forget you is because you usually just post about how no one remembers you.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Anyway,  Perpetual Lurker:</span>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> By default,  it costs <strong>four</strong> points to learn a Skill,  but that price can be reduced. Characters start with <strong>three</strong> skill points (six for Earth Ponies),  and gain and additional three points per level. </div>
<p></p><span class="blue">So it seems like first level characters won't have enough points to buy even a single skill?  This looks like it is going to be a very low powered game.  Which seems weird to me,  because,  sugar land tendencies aside,  I always thought the characters in MLP were pretty high powered.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">  Each level increases by 3 so it'll go like this:</span>
<p></p><ul><li>Level 2: 6 points.
</li><li>Level 3: 9 points
</li><li>Level 3: 12 points
</li><li>Level 4: 15 points.
</li></ul><p></p><span class="blue"> So if you purchase one skill each level after the first,  you'll have 2 points left over,  giving you enough to buy another skill every other level.  Meaning some levels will be a lot more of a bonus than others,  which is kind of odd.</span>

            Yeah,  things need work,  it's just a first draft,  after all. Anything involving numbers is liable to be a balance issue,  so those will need the most tweaking over time. Starting Attributes could definitely go up,  though. How much would you recommend?
<p></p>As far as skills go,  some will have "ranks" insofar as skills can have other skills as prerequisites,  meaning that,  for example,  Advanced Flight requires Basic Flight,  and Professional Flight requires Advanced Flight,  etc. They're really no different than Feats in D&amp;D in that respect. The main difference is that ones that your character's talent is focused on are easier/more efficient to obtain.
<p></p>If anyone wants to start creating/designing skills,  go ahead. We're going to need a lot of them.

<p></p><span class="blue">It really depends on how much characters would gain when the level up,  and how often leveling will be occurring.  But in general,  I would increase the Attribute Starting cap to at least 22 (+6),  maybe 26 (+8) and increasing the Attribute points to at 65-70.</span>

            Leveling/experience is always a rather weird thing for me. If we go with a normal EXP system,  it would be best if points were handed out at the GM's discretion instead of set values for certain accomplishments,  IMO. I'm almost inclined to go with a simpler,  merit based leveling system. If a character or group accomplishes something that the GM deems significant (or enough smaller tasks),  they are awarded a level. No points to keep track of means less metagaming and less bookkeeping,  but it allows for much more bias on the GM's part.
<p></p>I haven't played D&amp;D recently enough to remember how exactly the attribute gains worked there. One point per level seems simple enough,  but there's probably some math that gives a better way to do it. It seems to me that if you were to raise the starting cap that high,  you might as well not have a cap at all,  though. No one in their right mind is going to start with anything higher than 20 in a single stat,  and if they do,  they're crippling themselves elsewhere.
<p></p>Anyway,  I need to get to bed. See you guys tomorrow.

            Your leveling ideas sound good to me.  Doing a whole lot of experience points bookkeeping is boring and tedious.
<p></p>Also,  I agree,  I don't really think an attribute cap is necessary at all,  I only gave a suggestion because you seemed to want one.
<p></p>Good night.

            In D&D (3.5,  anyway),  you get 1 point to add to any one of your attributes at every level divisible by 4. That is,  levels 4,  8,  12,  16,  and 20. (And if you go into level 20+ epic campaigns,  at 24,  28,  32,  etc.)
<p></p>Going to go read the rules document now,  before I toss in my opinion. Assuming I have anything to add,  anyway.

            Hello miss Star Swirl.  Where's your beard?
<p></p>@Kyler:  One thing I never understood is <em>why</em> so many systems insist on the 10=average,  2 attributes=+1 bonus thing.  Its really awkward and unwieldy.
<p></p>For my system,  I went with all Attributes starting at 0,  which is Average.  Then you go up from there,  at a 1/1 ratio.  So having 1 of an Attribute gives you a +1 bonus,  having 6 of an attribute gives you a +6 bonus,  and so on.  Couldn't be simpler.
