            POV: That's actually worse,  sorry.  And it doesn't matter how big a part it plays in the series; it's part of the worldbuilding,  and thus informs the series.
<p></p>Counterspell: That may be true,  but there's a bit of difference between dispelling an enchantment cast by a powerful,  but still inexperienced student and directly blocking (as opposed to shunting) an attack spell performed by an opponent in the same weight class.
<p></p>Rearrranging continents: Fair,  I'll cede that point.  Though given the way Celestia and Chrysalis fought (by your reckoning,  by far the most magic power we've seen thrown around in the show to date,  and more than twice sufficient to destroy the sun),  I'd argue that combat laser beams,  as opposed to a magic duel by other means,  has precedent.
<p></p>"Not that the difference was big enough": My point,  that 'easily' is a relative term,  stands.
<p></p>Ambush: After they threw down the anthropomorphic personification of chaos and strife?  That's the sort of thing evil dictators tend to take notice of.
<p></p>'If I can kill you first': <em>If</em>.  That was kind of my point when I mentioned a struggle.
<p></p>Motives: I disagree.  If we take the demonstrated fact that Nightmare Moon is more powerful than Celestia in conjunction with the assumption that Celestia can destroy the solar system,  then analyzing her motives - eternal night and,  through that,  misery and eventual genocide - it becomes <em>less</em> likely that she would resort to parlor tricks up to and beyond the point where she expected to be sealed again.

            She'd get plenty of attention after she dispatched the people who threatened,  and then ended,  her reign.  Admittedly,  that might be a shortcoming in her personally (showboating before actually winning and all that),  but I'd still expect something more along the lines of a mile-high shadow wall or an illusion spell beamed directly into their minds; the fact that the little wisp of shadow that causes all the trouble the girls have along the way is both consistent (that is,  it splits itself entirely to form the Shadowbolts and reforms when they fail) and small that Nightmare Moon (and by extension Celestia) does indeed have limits.
<p></p>(That said,  I don't think Celestia fought Nightmare Moon during the Nightmare Solstice,  not knowing that she couldn't seal or purify her.  During the Nightmare Eclipse,  though,  I have no doubt that they reshaped the landscape around them.)

            My solution to the issue of "she can move the sun so she can crush the world" is that the more specific a spell is in function,  the more efficient and powerful it is. Telekinesis is very loose in purpose,  as it can affect just about anything,  so it's not very efficient. I doubt even a hundred Celestias could move the sun with normal Telekinesis. Consider,  though,  a spell that does only one thing,  and in a very specific way,  namely set the sun,  and only the sun,  in a very specific orbit. Something that specific is powerful enough to do its job,  and even then it takes the collective unicorn tribe to pull it off. Celestia has power equal to that of several hundred average unicorns,  but I personally wouldn't put her past "leveling a mountain" in terms of strength.
