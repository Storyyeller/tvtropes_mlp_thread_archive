            I doubt it,  hence why it would have to either be something else,  or merely be the setup for something else.  I don't think it's likely as the main drive of the episode,  especially as it doesn't reconcile easily with the "dark secret" bit of the plot.

            Everyone screwed up in Fallout Equestria,  it isn't like everything was Celestia's fault.  Most of the fics I've read have a fair take on Celestia,  the Trollestia/Molestia/tyrant stuff tends to show up in fics that are specifically about that kind of thing.

            And the exact same thing is true for the Zebras,  and for Luna,  if ANYPONY did ANYTHING differnt it could have been averted. and as always hindsight is 20/20 you CANNOT blame someone for acting in a certain way,  when the ONLY thing that would say they shouldn't is information they neither have,  nor SHOULD resonably have.

            Okay,  time for some pre-finale subjective analysis for new pony rankings! As I did last time,  I'm whipping out my personal 40 point scale,  in which each character is rated 1-10 in four areas that personally endear them to me: Character,  Cuteness,  Humor,  and Awesomeness.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="../wa/page-3930.html#post-98239">Here's my previous go at this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  and here's the final rankings from then for those who don't feel like reading the breakdown:
<p></p>1) Rarity (28)
<p></p>2) Fluttershy (27)
<p></p>2) Applejack (27)
<p></p>3) Twilight Sparkle (26)
<p></p>3) Rainbow Dash (26)
<p></p>4) Pinkie Pie (25)
<p></p>Now,  lets see what we got here.
<p></p><hr>
<p></p>Twilight Sparkle:
<p></p>Character: 8/10
<p></p>Cuteness: 8/10
<p></p>Humor: 5/10
<p></p>Awesomeness: 9/10
<p></p>Total: 30/40
<p></p><hr>
<p></p>Pinkie Pie
<p></p>Character: 5/10
<p></p>Cuteness: 7/10
<p></p>Humor: 10/10
<p></p>Awesomeness: 6/10
<p></p>Total: 28/40
<p></p><hr>
<p></p>Fluttershy
<p></p>Character: 6/10
<p></p>Cuteness: 10/10
<p></p>Humor: 6/10
<p></p>Awesomeness: 8/10
<p></p>Total: 30/40
<p></p><hr>
<p></p>Rarity
<p></p>Character: 10/10
<p></p>Cuteness: 8/10
<p></p>Humor: 7/10
<p></p>Awesomeness: 6/10
<p></p>Total: 31/40
<p></p><hr>
<p></p>Applejack
<p></p>Character: 8/10
<p></p>Cuteness: 5/10
<p></p>Humor: 8/10
<p></p>Awesomeness: 8/10
<p></p>Total: 29/40
<p></p><hr>
<p></p>Rainbow Dash
<p></p>Character: 7/10
<p></p>Cuteness: 9/10
<p></p>Humor: 5/10
<p></p>Awesomeness: 10/10
<p></p>Total: 31/40
<p></p><hr>
<p></p>Final Rankings:
<p></p>1) Rarity (31)
<p></p>1) Rainbow Dash (31)
<p></p>2) Twilight Sparkle (30)
<p></p>2) Fluttershy (30)
<p></p>3) Applejack (29)
<p></p>4) Pinkie Pie (28)
<p></p>Well.... Now I have even less conclusive rankings than before. Overall my opinions of all the ponies have improved,  and surprisingly RD has now tied Rarity for Best Pony,  but there is still only a 3 point gap between first and last place... There you have it. Since I can only pick three for the votes,  I'm going to have to go with:
<p></p>1. Rarity
<p></p>2. Rainbow Dash
<p></p>3. Fluttershy
<p></p>if only because Twilight already has a lot of votes,  and Rarity was the best first before RD,  so she gets the first slot. And so my inability to pick favorites becomes even worse...

            @Ginger AJ didn't go down,  she simply went up less than everyone else. Remember that she is only <em>two points</em> behind the top,  so the difference in opinion of the character is negligible.
