            @Chad: But with the changelings running around,  assuming we accepted Kegi's idea of non-enslavement,  how would they get their "food" without being caught? I'd think the ponies,  now knowing about changelings,  would withhold their loves in privacy.

            We saw an army,  and one with clear independent thought. Trained to take orders,  but they're still sapient. Outside of the military,  they'd revert to their subversive nature.
<p></p>And yeah,  she travels to find food. Big deal. Maybe there aren't enough hosts in a single country for all of them,  maybe she needed to find hosts for a new brood. Or they probably get booted out when they get discovered - and why? Because they <em>look</em> ugly,  and they're dishonest. Who's going to let them in? No,  so they get booted from country to country,  because of how they look and live,  and is it any wonder Chrysalis is a bit of a bitch? They're constantly rejected for something that isn't their fault,  despite the fact that they don't have any say in the matter.

            Alright one final thing. You're trying justify that a race of love draining bugs as not evil. Despite the evidence presented. Or specifically,  the lack of evidence.

            @Lurker: And that's why I asked how would the changelings feed. And as Kegi pointed out,  they would be shooting themselves in the hoof with that plan. Oh sure,  you could charade as the ponies in love,  but as evil!Cadence showed,  the changeling would not be able to get the real pony's behavior down 100%.

            Doesn't Chrysalis outright state that she was weakening Shining Armor by feeding off of him?  That's definitely more parasitic than symbiotic.  I think the question of if they're evil or not depends on if they need to feed off love to survive,  or if they simply do so to gain power.  We really don't get enough info in the episode to say one way or the other.

            All the evidence here is circumstantial on <em>both</em> sides. I'm not trying to justify them as 'not evil',  I'm saying that I don't think the terms good and evil can really apply to them. Mostly because quite frankly it's stupid to look at things as black and white <em>anyways</em>,  but also because you can't really blame something for acting on it's biological nature.
<p></p>But you're right on one thing,  we aren't going to reach a conclusion here. Mush as I'd like to keep going with it just to see where it leads,  from this point on I'm guess a circle.

            I can't speak for the mook changelings,  but Chrysalis was more attractive than an insectlike monster pony should be.

<p></p>Changelings are sapient. we can see them think,  reason,  and grow exasperated and confused during the fight scene.
<p></p>I'm sure there are dissident ones,  or ones who simply didn't enlist into the army.

            These are my views on the subject: Changelings are not inherently evil,  though their current method for feeding is dishonest at best.
