<p></p><span class="blue">Good idea Mousa.  The show really treats Spike's age in a weird way,  it seems very flexible.  He's a 'baby' but he's given a lot of personal responsibility and freedom,  as opposed to the CMC who have no responsibilities at all.  He was trusted to look after Fluttershy's animals that time,  even though they seem pretty intelligent and he's supposed to be a kid.  I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they had him babysitting the fillies at some point,  even though he's (possibly?) younger than they are.  All that inconsistency is possibly one of the reasons I don't like Spike that much.</span>

            It could possibly be kinda funny if the CMC treat him like he's much younger than them. So you have all of them treating him like a baby,  when he's easily the most mature,  and keeps pulling them out of the fire.

            Yeah,  I agree that they need to be more specific about that. I mean,  yeah,  I can see why they want to keep it malleable,  but at the same time trying to make him both the baby of the group and straight man of the group doesn't really work.
<p></p>@Seraphem: It's not what they <em>call</em> him so much as now they treat him.  They waffle back and forth between having him be one of the most level-headed cast members to being the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid">Tagalong Kid</a>.  The issue isn't that his maturity level is inconsistent with being a baby dragon,  it's that the maturity level itself bounces around from episode to episode depending on what's convenient.  Also,  my personal guess is that Spike is likely the same age as the CMC if not a bit older.  Sure the flashbacks in Cutie Mark Chronicles are all we have to go on,  but I think it's not an unfounded assumption to think that at least Apple Bloom wasn't born yet in AJ's flashback.

            "Maturity" isn't a uniform thing. Spike has a lot of common sense,  as well as a strong sense of responsibility,  both signs of maturity. Running contrary to that,  he also as demonstrated possessive issues,  as well as a childlike sense of humor. I've known adults almost exactly like that. Maturity and immaturity are not mutually exclusive,  as they apply differently to different situations and parts of one's personality.
<p></p>Spike seems pretty normal on for an intelligent,  well-educated,  well-raised child,  and I could conceivably see him being anywhere from 11-15 years old by our standards,  which don't even necessarily apply.

At some points he's somebody they have to keep an eye on and protect,  and sometimes he's perfectly okay on his own.  Granted,  it's not a huge problem,  just something that seems a bit odd.  Fortunately most of the time it isn't really noticeable.

<p></p><span class="blue">Agreed,  but that just raised more questions.  If he's 11-15,  why is he considered a baby?  The CMC seem to be about 7-11 to me,  and they're called fillies,  not foals.</span>

            It is worth noting that they never <em>just</em> call him a baby. They always qualify it as a baby dragon.

            So "Baby" is just a dragon subspecies?  That's actually really a interesting idea.
<p></p>@Seraphem: I understand the semantic issue. I'm not complaining that he doesn't act like a baby.  I just find it odd that there's no way to peg what his age level is supposed to be.  I know the series runs on <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge">Vague Age</a>,  but in all the other cases you can usually narrow it down a bit.  I.e. the CMC are obviously elementary/middle school age,  the mane cast are all roughly college age,  etc.  Spike can be anything from younger than the CMC to nearly as old as the mane cast,  depending on how you look at it.
