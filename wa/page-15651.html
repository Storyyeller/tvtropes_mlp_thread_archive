<p></p>Well,  wherever it was,  getting into a professional arena is pretty much guaranteed to be well over it.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Agin this is just your personal conjecture. Only Hasbro's lawyers can say for sure,  but I think it would have gotten C&amp;Ded anyway. </div>
<p></p>Perhaps,  but it might have bought them enough time to finish the game. And then once it got on the Internet,  getting rid of it would be impossible.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Again THEY didn't jump into it,  they were drawn in by the EVO guys and the hype around the game. </div>
<p></p>That's practically the same thing. They didn't have to accept,  but they did.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Anyway,  I think game development is particularly tough to stay motivated with since it's hard to get enojyment from playing your own game (obviously this depends somewhat on the genre,  with story or puzzle based games having it the worst). <strong>That means that if noone else is playing your game,  it feels like there's no point in continuing.</strong> </div>
<p></p>Bolding mine. I know,  I have had firsthand experience with it on multiple occasions. Thing is,  getting shut down isn't any better,  so being mindful of one's environment is just as important.

            @Story: Just getting <em>invited</em> to something like EVO should have been more than enough motivation to keep going. Even before that they were getting <em>tons</em> of attention.
<p></p>@Irish: Pretty much. I'm interested to see what comes of it.

<p></p>Yes. I don't know if I said it here,  but as soon as it was announced,  I was talking to several friends about how it was a face-desk-inducing moment that was going to get them shut down.

            Weren't they showing it off at EVO the previous year? That's probably why EVO knew about them.
<p></p>Sometimes I wonder if Hasbro is actually working on something video game related with My Little Pony. I think at New York Comic Con last year Mike Vogel,  when asked about the possibility of an MLP game,  brought up how well <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersFallOfCybertron" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersFallOfCybertron">Transformers: Fall of Cybertron</a></em> did. Makes me wonder what High Moon Studios is doing now that the Deadpool game is done...

            Hey guys it's me Starscream759,  talking to you from Leeds in York back in England. I will say Scotland has been pretty good,  had tons of fun in Edinburgh during the Fringe festival and I will definatly want to come back to Edinburgh. It was not the most groundbreaking of holidays but it was still a pretty good holiday.
