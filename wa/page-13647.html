            Afternoon everyone.  How's it going?
<p></p>So now that Twilight is a princess,  does that mean she'll be getting her own guard ponies?  I'd be totally down with adding a bat pony to the cast.  She can be completely dismayed by her charge's tendency to just head off into danger without consulting her,  and at first is super formal all the time,  but gradually is won over by the magic of friendship.

            I will flip my lid (in the good way) if a batpony joins the cast. I didn't think about that until you brought it up just now,  but now I want it as much as I want to see the griffon lands.

            Can I ask,  why does the analysis page for MMC episode recap exist? From what I can tell,  its someone complaining about <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> and saying the episode couldn't possibly have happened,  when it did...

            @Calnos: Somebody was posting in here earlier today and put that there.  Most of the complaints <em>are</em> valid... but only if you agree with his headcanon on how cutie marks work,  which almost no one here does.  Basically,  he's complaining that the show violated <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">Magic A Is Magic A</a>,  while everyone else (I think Perpetual said it) pointed out that the spell was Magic B.  It doesn't violate any established rules because there aren't established rules.  We know how things <em>generally</em> work,  but it's never said that they <em>can't</em> work that way. If anything it's the opposite; we know from "Cute Pox" that artificial cutie marks can force a pony to do things they don't like doing.
<p></p>TL;DR most of his complaints boil down to "I think it works <em>this</em> way" even though in most cases we simply don't have enough information to lay down real rules about how magic works in the setting.

            I can't see the page you were linking too,  but if it was about how cutie marks work then I don't think this episode really goes against anything we've seen.  This was an exceptional case,  and not really reflective of how cutie marks normally effect ponies.  Under most circumstances ponies probably aren't compelled by their cutie marks.  Also everything JT said.
<p></p>@Bad:  That was just for her coronation though,  they probably won't stick around.

<p></p>I actually all ways thought of Celestia as "outgrown such notions of petty love" as in the love of her people as a whole is greater then any romantic love,  are there any <em>above love</em> or <em>too powerful for romance</em> tropes?

            I actually find that more nightmare inducing than the idea that because of the sheer amount of time and the limitations of even an immortal's memory,  she'll eventually forget everyone who ever mattered to her,  and will likely realize what's happening as the memories of her dear departed friends and lovers slowly fade until they vanish.

            Unless she has super alicorn memory or something.  She seems to remember Starswirl just fine despite him living over 1000 years ago.

            <div class="quoteblock">IMHO,  time magic should be (very) limited in any setting.
<p></p>I do like Doctor Who,  watch it regularly,  but time travel is UGH... I always end up hating myself every time I am compelled to apply any bit of logic to time travel.
<p></p>Like with Harry Potter,  I was (facepalm) when time magic showed up in this 'verse so I am very much glad that we only saw it used once (so far),  just like in HP. </div>
<p></p>The thing is that most works just use time travel as a plot device to allow <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimePeriodOfTheWeek" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimePeriodOfTheWeek">Time Period Of The Week</a> or <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuesExMachinas" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuesExMachinas">Dues Ex Machinas</a>.

            <strong>Calnos</strong>,  I think it needs to be straight up zapped. It's a lot of "I think this" but the problem is,  it's not signed,  so how is anyone supposed to know who "I" is? And even if it were signed,  I don't think that this sort of rant was ever supposed to be the purpose of the Analysis page.

            @ Kyler: I can get behind that idea,  and it goes an awfuly long way towards explaining her apparent lack of interest in love (yeah,  I know,  none of the characters beyond Rarity have really expressed interest in romance,  but Celestia really strikes me as someone who's not looking for somepony to cuddle up with at night) without painting her in a light that I really don't like.

            @JT,  regarding the funny fellow with the odd issues: Actually it should be noted that this episode and the cutie pox work in demonstrably different ways. IT was,  in fact,  the major crux of the episode that the ponies were all BAD at their new 'talents',  whereas a sufferer of the cutie pox is sort of forced to be good at their new talents.
<p></p>Not that this proves anything in either direction,  mind you - The cutie pox could behave wrong due to being a disease,  or the spell could behave wrong due to being incomplete. Either is valid,  at this point,  so we can't call it either way.
