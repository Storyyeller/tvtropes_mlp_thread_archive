<p></p>But at any rate,  while them being humans for a bit would be interesting,  we don't know whether humans exist in their universe,  so that would be weird. And it wouldn't really fit the tone of the show,  IMO,  to have something as widespread as that happen,  but not have it be treated as weird. Especially if it were just like a normal episode except for that change,  I don't think I'd be a fan of it.

            I'm mixed about Humanizations. On one hand,  some have rather nice designs. On the other,  I wish more just went full-on human rather then a bizzare mish-mash of horse and human.

In it,  he's called Snowflake <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLargehuge" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLargehuge">Mc Largehuge</a>. We haven't seen a lot of him yet though. Twilight wants him to be her element of honesty. He's also almost deaf there.

            @Bad,  Orion: It's not a matter of liking or not liking it. It's hypocritical to complain about things in the thread that you don't like seeing,  and then complain about people who do the same thing on something you like (i.e. pony haters anywhere else).
<p></p>To be fair,  I can't remember Lurker complaining much about people disliking things he likes,  but still,  if you don't like the discussion,  you don't have to participate. And we certainly don't want people going around saying how much they hate everything.

            Ah,  talking about the whole Arbu thing,  I have this one niggling suspicion - ideally,  this would be the point where Littlepip goes "shit. Maybe I shouldn't just murder everything I don't like, " which seems to be her modus operandi for everything. But from the spoilers I read,  she still drops the nuke that mass murders tons of Diamond Dog hellhounds,  she still kills Autumn Leaf in cold blood,  and she still breaks the Enclave cloud cover,  forcing countless innocents on the wasteland and starting a civil war. It kinda just sounds like the only real things that come out of that are angst,  some ponies not liking her,  and her girlfriend hating her for a while.

She does lower the violence level and she didn't know what she was doing about the nuke due to modifying her memory,  Autumn Leaf was a last minute carefully considered decision (which was an understandable) and it wasn't <em>her</em> who parted the clouds.

<p></p>So,  when I read the story,  I find things that don't really make a lot of sense - these ponies seem fine with not cleaning centuries-old corpses out of their living spaces,  there are fridges that haven't been open in two hundred years that contain pure water,  Littlepip has a questionably large inventory space,  Raiders have that whole <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">Stupid Evil</a> thing going on,  and when I mention those I often get the defense that it's a crossover and that these were things that were in the game.
<p></p>And that's all fine and dandy,  but then we come to <em>this</em>,  where Littlepip has to do something awful because she doesn't have options. Isn't... isn't the entire point of games like Fallout that you <em>do</em> have options,  and lots of them? I mean,  it seems to me like it's supposed to be in the vein of games like Planescape: Torment (same developers,  actually) and Deus Ex,  which allow you to find the play style that works best for you. Yet in this crossover we never get a look at the available options.

            @Pannic: I extended my edit for an explanation. As for her choices,  some do happen and they're significant,  but I wasn't thinking about how a videogame would give more options. I knew nothing about the game when I started anyway. And as for Autumn Leaf,  while I disagreed with Littlepip in regards to the exact circumstances,  I'd normally agree with her as I believe that letting a multiple murderer live is equivalent to being a murderer yourself.

            That's because most people saw him once,  realized he'd be a pain,  and turned him off.  His annoyingness is mostly due to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>.

            @Pannic You completely ignore reasons behind those and important details.
<p></p>At that point  Hellhounds where nothing more that Deathclaws expy and Lilpip didn't know they are not always chaotic evil and they have that big settlement near her target,  Goddess. And it was only option to kill her,  if not stopped her Unity would take over entire Wasteland,  exterminate every non unicrons,  and turn every unicorn into Alicorn.
<p></p>She killed Autumn,  bastard who led Enclave invasion on wasteland (what caused death end destruction of many places and countless lifes,  not to mention war if anyone who resisted) to stop him and she didn't have option to take him capture.
<p></p>Enclave  cloud cover needed to be destroyed so that fascist state could fall,   same state what was in process of raping wasteland.  And that civil war (enclave civil war) was caused   by Enclave member themselfs (between those who wanted remain evil isolationist empire and those who wanted rejoin with equestria)
<p></p>And options when dealing with main villains in games are like this: you kill them all by yourself,  convince other to do this or you convince them to suicide,  sneak behind and blow them up.

            Well,  I'll see about those if/when I get to it. Obviously I'm not liking the story for all those reasons I've listed and bitched about. But if the most significant thing that comes out of the Arbu thing is "my annoying love interest hates me for a while, " then,  well,  fuck it.

            Sorry for the late response. I had to take care of something. Anyway,  my confusion on the whole double standard,  as I've stated,  is that they are two different things. One says X to Y while the other says Y to X. Even though they are flipped,  as far as I'm concerned,  it is the end result that matters.
<p></p>Now if this was about someone liking A to X but not B to X,  then I can see the double standard.

            @Sereg But if letting a murder live is also murder,  then why was killing the cannibals in Arbu evil? They had ritual murder <em>as their right of passage.</em> In any case,  I already more or less figured out exactly how everything was going to play out with the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemoryGambit" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemoryGambit">Memory Gambit</a> ahead of time,  and I wasn't that interested in seeing even more angst. The story really didn't have much more to offer me at that point besides backstory details that I would inevitably see as OOC.

Fair enough,  but then they come across the Shattered Ridge raiders,  and... these ones are different somehow because they've got sob stories and are somehow deserving of Littlepip's extremely situational compassion... that just confused the hell out of me.
