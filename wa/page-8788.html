            I was never popular,  but I avoided a lot of bullying because everyone thought I was the sort of person who'd pull a Columbine if they pushed me too far.

            Yeah,  but...
<p></p>Look,  the united states is not humanity. The united states is the united states. There's a lot wrong with it,  but their culture refuses to let them see it. the US basically runs on pride,  and that's not a good way to go.
<p></p>But honestly,  I think it's almost headed in the right direction. If it keeps up as it's going,  the US IS going to crash... which means somewhere along the line,  you NEED to see what you're doing to yourselves,  and you'll pull yourselves out of it. Which means that one more of the economic and cultural giants will be on the good side again.
<p></p>Failure and flaws often seem debilitating,  especially to those few who can see them. But Mistakes are a necessary part of growth,  and when something is broken it only heals stronger than before. "He who has never known failure,  knows nothing."

            I had a rough time cuz I was short and fat and my parents were poor.  I couldnt afford to wear Skidz or Addidas or Fila or LA Gear or any other bullshit that the kids thought were cool.  My parents always just bought me sweatpants and sweatshirts,  so thats all I ever got to wear.
<p></p>My nickname was Porkchop or Troll..
<p></p>I still get twitchy in my adult years bout all that stuff.. thats why I cant stand to see even mild bullying in cartoons.  Kicks in my rigteous indignation.

            Bored now...more ponies. A Friend in Deed.
<p></p>wow pinkies looks straight outa...erm...oh jeez,  what time period is that outfit reminding me of...
<p></p>oh hey,  it's those 2 again.
<p></p>oh,  cows do stuff besides hanging out at the farm all day?
<p></p>what? that old pony from last episodes musical number?
<p></p>another song number? They seems to be picking up the pace with these...
<p></p>oh jeez,  2 pinkies. perish the thought.
<p></p>and was wondering when the rest of the mane 6 would show up.
<p></p>this song is dragging on a bit too long...but it doesn't seem to actually be any longer than usual..huh
<p></p>wait,  how did pinkie come straight down then powerslide forward?
<p></p>yay,  the spa! I dunno what it is about them,  but I really like the those 2 spa ponies.
<p></p>oh man,  this is gingers least favorite episode I bet.
<p></p>wow,  who'd of thunk the only donkey that's always been living in ponyville that we've never seen until now just happens to be the long lost girl of the new donkey in town! It's like they took <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewOldFlame" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewOldFlame">New Old Flame</a> but took it up to 11 and made both characters a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewOldFlame" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewOldFlame">New Old Flame</a>. Do we have a trope for that?
<p></p>and there was like 4 seconds of screentime for AJ(and rarity)! This really must be gingers least favorite episode!
<p></p>I didn't really care for it much either,  to be honest. Not that I have anything against Pinkie,  but,  well,  Pinkie must be taken in moderation and interspersed with other mane ponies.

            Wow,  It would appear that the entirety of this thread seems to have had problems. That's... kinda creepy. In reality,  things are almost <em>never</em> that bad in most places. At least,  not anywhere I've ever been,  or with anyone I've ever talked with outside this thread...
<p></p>@Kegi You really can't blame that on the educational system. It's a problem of bad people,  not bad education. I'm sure there are just as many bad apples in any school system.

Yeah,  Applejack thinks that Silver Spoon and D.T. are her <em>friends</em>. Is that optimistic or just stupid?
<p></p>D.T. is a wicked witch,  if you ask me. Her father seems like an okay guy,  but you can tell that there's not much he can do about her. At least S.S. has proven to have redeeming qualities. What's next,  D.T. starts literally kicking puppies?

            DT is like one of those spoilt litle rich girls who has no idea of what the real world is like because she's living on Daddy's money.
<p></p>She needs some community service or something to open her eyes.  Maybe a class field trip to go work at a soup kitchen in Phillydelphia or Manehattan.

            @Lurker: What,  the teachers not caring or the US's issues? Because the US's issues are more cultural than anything,  not educational.
<p></p>But I'm sure that a fair amount of the problem does lie in the system. Yes,  there are bad apples in every system - my elementary school principle was one of them,  doing such things as trying to control my brother's ritalin medication and overmedicate him.
<p></p>But a bad system will cause a lot of problems where they didn't exist before. The fact that teachers in the US <em>barely</em> make enough to survive puts a lot of strain on them,  and the fact that a lot of school have generally very poor funding means that the strain is compounded by the fact that they simply don't have the resources to be doing a lot of things they should to keep things running smoothly. The teachers don't really make enough to care because their worried for their own future,  and the schools are encouraged to keep things running 'smoothly' and not to kick up the system too much. I recall reading a news story about a place in the US where a rule forbade teachers from speaking about homosexuality in any context that would imply them taking a side on it,  meaning they weren't able to counsel gay students being bullied or to reprimand their bullies - leading to a <em>spike</em> in suicides.
<p></p>Now that's not happening everywhere,  obviously,  but it's an example. The system is making it very difficult for the teachers to be doing all the things they could and should be doing.

<p></p>Hi I just saved your life!
<p></p>Yea well you broke one of my ribs performing CPR... Im suing you!

            I don't know,  DT was pretty good at managing the newspaper,  despite her amoral methods with it. She'll turn around until her behavior end up directly harming her,  and at the moment,  it really isn't. She still <em>has</em> friends. What we don't know is if those friends are really her friends,  or if they're just with her for her popularity/money. It would take losing them for her to take a look at herself and see that there is a problem.

            @Lurker She has <strong>A</strong> friend. At least one that she regularly hangs out with.
<p></p>And Silver Spoon seems to genuinely care about her (though they could easily change that if they wanted to)
<p></p>They should do an episode about DT losing her friend though,  I agree
