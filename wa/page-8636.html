<p></p>@Applelight: Seems that why. Though I guess that would mean that if each of the sisters used to wield three of the elements each,  they would have appeared as three suns and three moons.

            @Moe  Maybe  if watched that show before MLPFIM I would hate her less (but still she would be extemly annyoing.
<p></p>She is like kids from Transformers,   with her presence being completely unnecessary and Autobots were helpless without her.
<p></p>And that outfit change made things even worse.

<p></p>This is practically confirmed. The only one  that kept its shape was magic. Yt another reason that I believe that cutie marks are specific enough to function as language and Twilight's mark is the symbol for magic.

<p></p>Three Suns,  Three Moons?
<p></p>Now that's an interesting theory!
<p></p>And they say that the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EoH" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EoH">Eo H</a> were 'discovered'...I wonder what the story behind that was.

            @Applelight: Hoping that season three answers that in a flashback episode explaining how the sisters defeated Discord. If it also shows the rise and fall of Nightmare Moon,  so much the better. If it also shows the origin of the sisters,  better still.

            Okay,  my theory was that the elements were originally placed in 6 seperate temples scattered all over the world,  and that they were each protected by a trial. A trial that would serve as the <em>ultimate</em> test of that particular virtue.
<p></p>I was wondering... what would these trials be? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

You might get an idea from there.

            I actually kinda like the whole "created in a lab" thing. Like the previous civilization that resided on whatever the name of their planet is were experiencing the end days,  with war and strife everywhere,  and some scientists working underground(figuratively) created them as a last chance kinda thing and used them to wipe the slate clean.

            <div class="quoteblock">@Moe Maybe if watched that show before MLPFIM I would hate her less (but still she would be extemly annyoing.
<p></p>She is like kids from Transformers,  with her presence being completely unnecessary and Autobots were helpless without her.
<p></p>And that outfit change made things even worse. </div>
<p></p>Ah yeah,  I could see that.  I thought her use was legitimate in "Escape From Midnight Castle" but after that... then again,  "Escape" was the only episode that <em>needed</em> to happen.
<p></p>Anyway,  don't expect my fanfics to do anything bad to Megan (its possible she won't even be mentioned).  But I'm taking <em>large</em> liberties with the G1 canon since it basically sucked (I mean,  they give <em>Dream Castle</em> to some stupid gnomes just because they saved a baby.  Yeah,  not acknowledging that.)
