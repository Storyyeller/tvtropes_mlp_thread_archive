This is pretty neat. <br> <br><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Straight hair Pinkie is named Pinkamena because of the flashback in CMC,  before her hair poofed up. And the association of Cupcakes with straight hair was made long after the story had been written.

            All of the "Pinkamina is a serial killer" fanon has always bugged me. "Pinkamina" never struck me as deranged. Just sad and alone and missing a screw or two. I don't think of her as a separate character,  either. She's just Pinkie without all of the things that made her happy. I'm way in the minority on that particular bit of headcanon,  though.

The fic is almost universally considered bad,  so why would it's obviously OOC interpretations of the characters make it into popular fanon?

In an interview with the author,  he said he didn't actually consider her hair at all. My guess is that the fandom just latched onto straight hair to make her differentiable from normal Pinkie.

There's just something about Megasweet's art style that I'm not a fan of. Can't really place it.

            I like Pinkamena as a repressed split personality because I like angsty character drama. But only as alternate-universe headcanon.

<p></p>Actually,  Cupcakes is based on Call Of The Cutie from what I've heard. It predates Party Of One,  which is probably part of what made it so infamous.

            Cupcakes predates Party of One by quite a while. It was when Party of One came out that people were screaming about Cupcakes.
