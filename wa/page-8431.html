            Well,  Faust said Rd would be a bad Big Sis as in a bad at being an actual family type sister,  not a bad Big Sister figure. Which I agree with,  interacting wth Scoots once in a while she'd be fine,  but if she was with her all the time as family,  then,  whole nother thing.
<p></p>As to the falcon,  but she didn't just reject him,  she was really torn,  she DIDN'T want to say no to either,  she couldn't decide,  it was the falcon that stepped aside on his own.
<p></p>OH,  OH,  you are going to have FUN then Blissey,  that is one of the things that people LOVE about the show,  there very very rarely IS just ONE lesson/moral. All the "dear Princess Celestia" thing is is what that ONE pony learned most from it,  not what some other pony could learn. But there are so many great morals,  and the show never feels the need to have to point them out,  they know enough will get them on there own.

            It was more how broken the damn thing looked after all the ponies cheerfully rooted for Tank,  seemed like a huge <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">Yank the Dog's Chain</a>. Oh well,  Fluttershy looks after it I guess.
<p></p>I agree RD shouldn't be an ideal big sister,  but I like the idea of her having shades of responsibility and care as you say. A good idea for an episode may be the older sisters of the CMC being concerned she's a bad influence,  thus maybe show her flaws AND strengths as a peer to others.
<p></p>Death Cloud: Not really a spoiler. It was mentioned in some reviews. Don't know much else accept it's connections to Alien,  again mentioned in some reviews.

<p></p>Personally,   I think it was the better way to go about things,   actually owning up to what they did.

            @Seraph I thought it was entertaining but VERY flawed.
<p></p>I don't think it's my villain obsession here that makes me say that the queen and her brother are <em>easily</em>,  far and away the most interesting and sympathetic characters in the movie. It feels like the filmakers were far more interested in them than in any of the good guys. and they  were both IMPOSSIBLY badass.
<p></p>The plot is VERY predictable (though one villainous moment <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where the queen disguises herself as the <em>prince</em> to trick Snow White into eating the apple</span> almost surprised me) and all attempts at romance are pathetic (though,  honestly I thought the lack of romance was intentional.) and the script has this weird habit of setting up something PURELY so it can set up the next part of the plot (for example,  the dark forest that Snow White runs into is only in the film for about... 15 minutes,  and only exists to give the queen a reason to need the huntsman. After Snow and the huntsman meet,  they leave the forest incredibly quickly. It's a plot point that existed PURELY to justify a certain character's involvement in the plot.)
<p></p>And Kristen Stewart really wasn't THAT bad in the movie. Better than she was in Twilight,  but there's a point in the movie where she gives this big rallying speech to her troops and you JUST don't buy it... at all. She doesn't have anywhere near the level of gravitase needed to pull off a speech like that <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>But it was good. REALLY,  I enjoyed it. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii"> It had a badass (seriously,  the heroes don't dominate ANY fights in this entire movie),  sympathetic villain. Purely for that,  I didn't regret watching it.
