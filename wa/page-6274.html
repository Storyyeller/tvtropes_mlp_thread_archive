            Hey I'm kind of a Longtime lurker of this thread. So I've seen at least some of your guys post but probably not most of it. The last time I posted here was during the Post-Season 1 Break. If you'd like I can do that questionnaire thing that I've sometime seen you guys do. (Favorite Pony,  Would you Hug Trixie,  Opinion on Pinkie,  etc.). No promises that I suddenly become an active poster here though.
<p></p>Also I see Avatar's been a recent discussion. Which happens to be another of my favorite shows other then Friendship is Magic. Those 2 are the shows I most enjoy. There's only one other cartoon that I like about as much as these 2 right now and that's Courage the Cowardly Dog.

<p></p>To be fair,  it wasn't just natural talent. Toph had a completely different style due to being blind and learning from the Badger Moles instead of a human teacher. So most of her opponents wouldn't be used to it. And she probably practiced extra hard just to spite her parents.

It would be from the perspective of Twilight and focused on her feelings before and after she became friends with the Mane Cast (so,  basically,  covering the first two episodes).

<p></p>Well,  Ginger,  I think the only thing I can say is to watch a few episodes and see how it goes. But I think you might enjoy watching The Legend of Korra more. You would only have to get through the first 2 episodes,  you don't have to catch up to anything,  and you don't have to watch 60 episodes. Your choice man.

            Thanks ilsemmr. On Equestria Forums I'm known as Northern Verve. Not that I'd suggest most of you guys have been there. But I've said most of what I've thought of the show there.
<p></p>Also if you mean Courage,  Chadaman 99,  yeah that was a sad episode. But was really enjoyable anyhow.
