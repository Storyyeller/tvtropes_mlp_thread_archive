<p></p>Well,  there's that too,  but I still think that Cadence only has one alicorn parent unlike Luna and Celestia and as such she isn't <em>as</em> powerful. There's probably been a few like her around.

<p></p>5.  Equestria is actually the world of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>... 1000 years later.  Red XIII's descendants somehow evolved into Ponies.

            Not exactly hard evidence,  I just happen to believe it. Clearly,  alicorns <em>do</em> take non-alicorns as mates sometimes. We've seen it both here and in Hearts and Hooves Day. Cadence has aged visibly over Twilight's lifetime,  doesn't have the flowing mane of power and doesn't control a massive celestial body (not that what she <em>does</em> control isn't important and powerful). She also clearly doesn't have a lot of responsibilities compared to Celestia and Luna. Also,  this makes other alicorns easier to explain.
<p></p>Assuming I'm right,  should Princess Permafrost be a full or half alicorn. (I think that she should be the alicorn of cold,  just like Cadence is the alicorn of love.)
<p></p>EDIT: Spoken,  Modern Equestrian sounds exactly like we've been hearing. Almost identical to English. Classical Equestrian (which at the time was known as Unicornian) is Middle English. The writing systems have been seen in the show already. It's believed that there is one for each tribe.

Anyway,  it seems that Korra did not learn her lesson from the first episode,  though at elast she kept the lesseon from episode 2.

            I know that Celestia and Luna once looked younger than they do now,  and didn't have the flowing manes back then,  yes. (the storybook and Luna's first appearance)
<p></p>So,  I'm confident in saying that similar rules apply to Cadence.

            Oh wow. I just read through 30-40 pages of shitstorm since last night,  didn't I?
<p></p>Anyway,  I guess I could weigh in on a few things with my opinions/headcenon.
<p></p>While <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">Remember the New Guy</a> <em>was</em> present,  it didn't really bother me at all. Nobody really cared when Sweetie Belle was revealed to be Rarity's sister a good while after the introduction of both characters,  so I don't see why it should be a problem now. I'd also say that it's been at least implied that Twilight's family is nobility,  considering the fact that in real life,  you don't even get <em>looked at</em> for prestigious private schools if your family doesn't have either the fame or the money up front to make it worth their while,  so having a young princess for a foalsitter isn't too farfetched to me either. Regardless,  even if you didn't care for it,  it still didn't create any actual plot holes,  and actually managed to fill one in (at least in my mind),  that hole being why in the world would Twilight even know the Want It Need It spell. In hindsight it appears to be rather obviously an imperfect attempt of replicating Cadence's signature magic.
<p></p>In terms of character focus,  I can't weigh in because those types of things don't bother me at all. So long as no one is acting OOC and the episode is entertaining,  everything's fine and dandy. Would it be nice if Twilight shared the main character slot with the other 5? Sure. Did it actually hurt the episode at all that she didn't? No.
<p></p>Now,  as for Cadence,  my headcanon is that she is the young Goddess of Love (which confers on her the Princess title). Presumably she would be on equal standing with the other princesses in a few thousand years or so.
<p></p>In any case nothing ever creates any actual plot holes,  no one was OOC,  and we've resorted to nitpicking to find any actual problems with it. I'd say that the finale was definitely a success.

            @Enlong: That was <em>much</em> further back. I don't believe that <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty">Immortality Begins at Twenty</a> applies to Alicorns (I don't like that trope,  so I admit that I may be biased). I've personally believed since the beggining of the first season that Luna is actually still a teenager and a thousand years wasn't enough to stop her from being one.
<p></p>@crowlover: Well,  presumably the import of Fancy words came earlier,  but I'm not going back past the end of the Classical Era.
