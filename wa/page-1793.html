            My favorite parts where the stuff on the train and the horse drawn horse drawn carriages thing. Since it was the first episode I watched,  I didn't really mind all the new characters.
<p></p>Anyway,  how was RD a asshole in May The Best Pet Win? I just don't see it. Those animals WANTED to be her pet. She didn't force them to do anything,  and even suggested they drop out.

Yeah,  she was really harsh on them,  but as far as we can tell,  they all entered the competition entirely voluntarily.  I mean,  people keep going on about "RD is so awful for making putting the animals in danger flying through the gorge!",  but...she didn't make them do anything.  She basically said "if you don't want to do it,  drop out",  which is a bit harsh,  but given that she's running the competition,  she gets to pick the challenges.  The only real jerk moments were her treatment of Tank for most of the episode,  and pulling the rug out from under the falcon at the end.

Might have ended without starting a war,  given how both Braeburn and Little Strongheart were eager to come to a quick compromise in the first place.

            I didn't mind "Over a Barrel."  Enough cuteness to keep me entertained (to be honest,  I really liked Pinkie bothering Rainbow Dash when RD was trying to be all stealthy).  Only thing is I really didn't like the buffalo,  though I understand they were necessary for there to even be a story.

            I don't know about that. Braeburn and Little Strongheart were eager to clear things up,  but it was the cast that brought them together in the first place. True,  it would have resolved itself in some way or another,  but it probably wouldn't have been easy diplomacy.

            I don't really see "they were superfluous" as much of a complaint.  The entire premise of the series is superfluous,  and most of the plotlines don't go anywhere until someone screws something up.
<p></p>Just sayin'.

            Moe has a point,  though it's phrased a little more harshly than I would have put it.  From a Doylist point of view,  there has to be conflict.  Even from a Watsonian point of view,  I don't have a problem with the plot of "Over A Barrel"; falling into a local brouhaha is a time-honored variant of the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyWaysideTribe" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyWaysideTribe">Wacky Wayside Tribe</a>,  after all.  It's not like the girls are just sitting on the sidelines and watching,  either (which is a case in which they <em>would</em> be superfluous); they actively assist one side or the other.
<p></p>Incidentally,  Ginger,  I find it <em>really</em> weird that the one time Pinkie <em>isn't</em> used in exactly the way you dislike,  you hate even more. XD

Although FPK wasn't a Pinkie Pie episode,  it was a Twilight Sparkle episode. Pinkie wasn't even featured there as a character,  more like a walking plot device.
<p></p><hr>
<p></p>Also,  I am rather surprised with ponychan's "Who is best pony?" polls. Rarity is astonishingly popular,  but Sparkle is astonishingly not.

            I find those "Who is best pony" or "Rank the mane cast 1-6" queries hard to answer.
<p></p>Not only it changes,  like,  every episode,  but it would also make me name the worst pony.
<p></p>I can't outright say it's Applejack,  I just like her the least because she doesn't get any screentime lately,  and because Dashie shares all of her flaws,  but moreso,  meaning if they want to deliver an aesop about them,  they'll do it in a Dashie ep.
<p></p>That,  and Twilight is another character tier entirely - I mean,  her personality is just awesome,  but she is the hero.
