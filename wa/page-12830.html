            I honestly don't find it particularly weird that the show isn't examining the issue.  I think it's less that they couldn't get away with dead parents,  and more that it isn't something that they'd want to take the trouble to fit in the show.  Basically,  I don't think they'd address the death of Applejack's parents without making a whole episode out of it,  and they likely would rather not have an episode about that on a show that's more aimed at teaching social skills.  Not that there aren't lessons to be learned,  but it's not the kind of thing the show usually tackles.

            I would just like to cite Mr. Hooper's death in Sesame Street. And <em>that</em> was a show whose function was mainly teaching little kids the ABC's.
<p></p>It <em>can</em> be done,  but it takes a lot of stones. And also a lot of care,  but I don't doubt for a moment that the producers can do that if they dared to.
<p></p>Dealing with mortality <em>is</em> a social skill. And like it or not,  some of their target audience <em>does</em> have to deal with this sort of thing. Some might have lost a parent. Or both. Or have never known them in the first place. And I think it's doing those kids a disservice to imply that those issues aren't worth talking about.

            The episode was cute.
<p></p>But I am still waiting for a writer that can actually give Applejack and Fluttershy their own centric episodes without cut away shots to the other main characters,  Pinkie Pie being random,  or having other ponies pointing out their issues in relation to the current situation. It's like these two are not allowed to make mistakes and correct it themselves. I'm convinced that they are big girls and have a mind of their own,  and the writers should let the audience know that.

            Okay,  I'll give you that.  Sesame Street is a different kind of show,  though.  It isn't nearly as character or plot based as this one.  But still,  my point is that the reasoning for not bringing it up is less "getting away with it" and more that the writers don't feel like addressing it for whatever reason.  I fully realize that dealing with mortality is a valuable skill,  but it doesn't mean that the show writers would feel up to including it.  They might,  but really,  who knows?

            How often do they have these family reunions again? I think I heard them say 100 moons,  which could be old timey talk for 100 years,  (this seems unlikely) or something else entirely.

            Then the question becomes "Why not have them alive?" Surely parents who travel a lot and then came home for the big reunion would be fairly heartwarming and idealistic? Alas,  it might be a moot point. Maybe the comics can explore it somehow?
<p></p>Now that you mention it,  I am having trouble thinking up of cartoon characters with dead parents/parental figures that <em>aren't</em> superhero cartoons.

            That was prompted by the actor's real death,  which is a catalyst we don't have here. That's a good part if why they dealt with it that way.

            I can get the writers not feeling up to the task. Admittedly,  it's a pretty tall order.
<p></p>I just keep hoping that <em>someone</em> decides to have the nerve to do it,  because that kind of issue is very much a thing in the real world.

            Some people have posited a moon is a lunar cycle,  so about a month(Meaning the gap is about 8 years,  someone worked out),  other say it could mean a day,  which would mean they have them three times a year,  give or take. Personally I'm inclined towards month. Which would mean Moon is their term for month and they clearly don't have a concept of a year as a thing,  which is... interesting.

            I agree with JT that the issue isn't so much can they get away with it as whether or not they want to have a really sad episode.  The tone of the show has generally been much more upbeat,  suddenly having a dead parents episode would be quite a shift.  That's not to say they couldn't do it well,  but I won't be surprised if it never comes up.

            8 years actually seems like a pretty big gap between reunions.  My family has one every year.  Granted,  we all live within a state or two,  and have access to cars.  Maybe 100 moons is just an expression that means a really long time?

            I've only ever had one in my lifetime for extended family. In terms of aunts and uncles we met several times a year because we all lived within a city of one another. With the exception of myself,  now.

            A reunion for my dysfunctional family is <em>way</em> out of the question.  My father and mothers side don't mix,  and my mothers side is full of deadbeat criminals and has split right down the middle.

            When I think about it,  I don't enjoy reunions at all. I feel like I have nothing in common with anyone except for bloodlines. I'm the guy that sits in the corner reading his book,  waiting until we can <em>finally</em> go home.

            I for one am chalking it up to Granny Smith's wacky-ness. I saw someone suggest on derpibooru that a lunar cycle in Equestria might actually be a week,  shortening the last reunion down to about 2 years (lining up nicely with the pilot episode). The <a class="urllink" href="http://cdn.derpiboo.ru/thumbs/1200/900/2012/12/22/17_20_56_981_190418__UNOPT__safe_screencap_spoile-%20r_s03e08_apple_family_family_photo">last reunion<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> photo has AJ,  Applebloom,  Big Mac,  and Braeburn appear to be no younger than they are now,  though that might be because the art team didn't want to make teen models for AJ,  Mac,  and Braeburn plus a baby version of AB.
<p></p>In short,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra">don't worry too much about the timeline</a>.
