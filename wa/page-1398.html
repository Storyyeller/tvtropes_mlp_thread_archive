            About pony Sims,  has anyone else made them?  I made the Mane Cast (the main 6 girls) along with several G1 and G3 ponies as human Sims in the Sims 3 (since that game allows for the weird hair colors that would fit them).  I was glad to get the Ambitions pack because when I got that,  I could finally have Rarity be a fashion designer like she is in the show.  I think the other jobs I remember are Pinkie Pie as a cook,  possibly Fluttershy as a scientist (closest one in the game to working with animals) and Applejack as a self-employed gardener.  I think Rainbow Dash was an athlete but I unfortunately don't remember what job track I gave Twilight at the moment.

<p></p>Also as far as whoever takes over Twilight's job,  I was more thinking about taking care of the town library then the student part,  plus who knows what else Twi does on a usual day.

            I don't remember the careers in my Sims game. If I recall,  Pinkie is dating Dash. Fluttershy and Applejack are married. Rarity and Big Macintosh are married.

            I think we Bronies tend to forget that this show is still aimed primarily at <strong>young girls</strong> who probably just think that Rainbow Dash is cool,  and Pinkie Pie is funny/silly. I'm pretty sure they don't sit around debating whether or not Twilight and Dash will ever "do the nasty".  At least,  I <em>hope</em> they don't. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            That's the whole point of these kinda of episodes,  is that the ponies trying to do the others job all fail becuase they under-estimated how hard it was
<p></p>plus this would give us a hance to see just what each Mane cast pony does on a day to day basis.
<p></p>Like everyone thinks all pinkie does is through parties and eat sweets,  then whoever takes over for her finds out that she literally plans every party in town,  so the person taking over gets swamped trying to keep track of what party is for what event,  gets what decorations/food etc..

            No,  Bronies are just men so desperate to take everything from women that they think the whole show is about them and whine if there is something for little girls in it. That may be an exaggeration,  but PLEASE do NOT act like the whole show is for college aged men. It has a female audience in mind. Please acknowledge it for what it is—an appealing show for GIRLS that happened to reach a wide audience. Saying everything should be for men is annoying.

<p></p>Calling non-heterosexuality "abnormal" in the sense of "atypical" or "unusual" isn't too offensive<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u> <div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> <sup>at least I wouldn't consider it such,  although it's still a poor choice of words</sup> </div></span>,  but "abnormal" as in "there's something wrong with you if you aren't like this" is.
<p></p>Anyway,  concerning the mane cast,  I don't think there's any evidence for any orientation based on canon outside of Rarity's desire for Blueblood,  and as noted that isn't really romantic interest anyway.  So in Fanon,  just about anything that isn't obviously contradictory goes.
<p></p>And yeah,  the whole "Bronies are the part of the fanbase that matters" thing bugs me too.

            ^Yeah.  I have no issue with people saying that other orientations aren't the <em>norm</em>,  because they aren't,  but 'not the norm' and 'not normal' in the sense of 'not natural' are two different things.  I'm sorry if I misread you,  CDRW.
<p></p>Regarding the Twilight reveal trailer: I wonder if that's her battle music.  I didn't recognize the core theme,  though - 'At the Gala',  maybe?
<p></p>^I don't think we're the part of the fanbase that matters,  but I definitely prefer our fan community to the core demographic's fan community. =D

<p></p>But really,  the lightheartedness and simplicity of the show are two of the biggest reasons I like it(other than the fact that it has the best characterization for a kids show I've seen in a long time).  That's probably part of the reason all the grimdark fics rub me the wrong way; I watch the show for the optimism,  so seeing it get stripped out of the setting is just weird.

            I figured out why Twilight didn't think to look under E for the Elements of Harmony. Pinkie Pie alphabetizes them by the ascii interpretation of the hash of their contents. Since she has the whole thing memorized anyway,  she can quickly compute the hash and knows where to look.
