            Ok,  yeah,  I see the issue people have with them. I'm not really that irritated,  but this episode indicates that future Cutie Mark Crusades are going to have them continually fail to actually realize what their obvious talents are. Correct? I can see why that would bother people.
<p></p>And now,  sleep.

            They get a little bit better in the 2nd season,  but yeah.  The next focus episode they get is even more blatant about them ignoring their obvious talents.

            I understand the fridge brilliance about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">losing the farm</span> (spoiled for Arha's sake),  but I still don't understand why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Brothers seemed to assume that the farm would go to them. They won cider-production rights. They didn't win the land,  the buildings,  or even any apples outside of what was used for the competition. If the episode hadn't gone on to give the Apples a way out,  then at the least they could have refused business to the Brothers,  and told them to get off of their property,  which was still <em>their property</em>,  for however long they'd be able to still maintain it. Maybe write a few letters to the countless orchards run by the extended Apple family,  tell them about what happened. Good luck getting any apples now,  Brothers.</span>

A lot of people say that the brothers weren't actually con men like they expected going into the episode,  but they sort of were,  and the con was making the Apple family think that their situation was much more dire than it was.  Their talk about owning the farm and tearing down the old buildings was them still playing up the Apple's hopelessness,  when really they still had other ways of keeping the farm.</span>

            I wonder if there even are any apple farms that aren't owned by their extended family.  There sure were a lot of them at the reunion.  You might need to go halfway to Zebra country to find an apple farm not owned by them.  Flim and Flam may have shot themselves in the hoof by ticking them off.
