            Yeah,  basically the entire story is pure characterization and "empty" moments where the characters just go about their day and interact. It's brilliantly paced and incredibly sweet and cute,  only really held back by the so-so art.

            It really does feel like an episode,  yeah.  I mean the regular IDW comics are awesome but have a noticeably different feel and ambition.  This one would've been right at home in Season 3 when Twi's a bit wiser than early on (and would've been quite a bit better than most of S3).
<p></p>I particularly enjoyed the twist that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it wasn't a twist for Twilight.</span>

            It's unpleasant,  but not too bad.  The needle to freeze your mouth is the sorest part...from then it just becomes unpleasant feeling.

            Depends on how sensitive you are to anaesthetics.  When I had to get my tooth pulled that area was pretty much dead and it was more disturbing than painful,  but my mother has some kind of...crossed nerves or <em>something</em> that makes her distressingly resilient to it.
<p></p>The bigger problem is general unpleasantness of having fillings in your mouth all the time.

            Even if you're one of those people who have a difficult mouth to numb,  you can still let them know if it's not enough when you feel the first twinge of pain and they'll just keep loading you up until it works.

            @Dark: Not generally. I mean,  they <em>try</em> to make it painless at least. I've had ones that didn't hurt at all,  ones where I was uncomfortable because of the vibrations of the drill,  and one where the anesthetic just didn't take,  so I had to suffer through it. But you <em>probably</em> won't have that happen,  especially if they're doing multiple teeth. They're gonna put a LOT into you.

            @Dark: It depends on a number of factors,  especially how good the doctor is,  and how much the anesthesia affects you.  I've never had a filling,  but I've had lots of dentist stuff done to me,  and mostly it falls under "uncomfortable" rather than "Painful". The only thing that <em>hurt</em> was getting my wisdom teeth pulled,  and even then it wasn't the actual pulling but the achey-ness afterward.

            I'm not sure then because I have fairly crooked teeth. In fact,  I never had to get wisdom teeth pulled because there was enough room for them to grow.
<p></p>Hopefully I'll get a buzz off the medication at least. Probably be babbling about ponies and humming bits of Morning in Ponyville.

            So is the Twilight thing a seperate series of comics from the IDW thing? It's hard to keep track.

            Yeah you're not getting high on Novocaine.  There's actually a long list of medical reasons why they prefer local anaesthetics that don't affect your mind,  feelings about recreational drugs being the least of them by far.
<p></p>For instance,  they want you to be able to tell them if you feel something going horribly wrong.  They also don't want to induce addiction.

            Your mouth is going to be numb for the rest of the day though,  so be careful not to bite yourself.  You won't be able to tell how badly you're hurting yourself since you can't really feel it.
<p></p>So general opinion on the comic is that its really good?  Alright,  I'll try to pick up a copy when I get the car back.

            @Crow: Yeah,  judging on the first three issues I'd honestly say that the comic's quality is easily comparable to the show's,  although it definitely has a different feel to it.  The character voices are solid,  but the art style is quite different and it's a fair bit darker and more detailed.  Definitely worth the cost,  IMO.
<p></p>Also,  the comic contains <a class="urllink" href="http://derpibooru.org/238645?scope=scpe281ceccc367a15df47625985ce1ca4c2fbe56ea5">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  which justifies it's entire existence.

            The <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyMicroSeries" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyMicroSeries">Micro-Series</a> is a series of one-shots focusing on specific characters. Only the Mane Six are planned for now,  but the editor said its certainly possible for them to expand beyond that should sales be good.
<p></p>IDW has been really uncreative with the name of their pony comic series. Could they have just called it <em>My Little Pony: Spotlight</em> like they do with Transformers' own series that focuses on specific characters? Side note,  I also checked out IDW's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> Micro Series (current issue focuses on April),  has the same editor as the pony comics and the same colorist as the main pony comic. It was kinda neat.
<p></p>The next one will be Rainbow Dash. It apparently involves her and Tank fighting sky gremlins. <em>Yes</em>.

            I never could quite get into the comic series. Something about the writing is just off putting to me. Art is pretty good though.
<p></p>Might get the micro-series though.

            @JT:  Looks like Pinkie's been taking costume advice from Spike.
<p></p>So sky gremlins are a thing now?  Alright.  Now I'm picturing Celestia riding on her chariot and seeing one of the pegusi flying it has a gremlin attacking him but no one believes her.
