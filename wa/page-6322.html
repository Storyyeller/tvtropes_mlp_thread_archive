            Strangely enough,  I watched that show up to episode 5-6 before stopping. It wasn't bad,  and I liked how serious it was taking itself,  but I wasn't interested enough to prioritize finishing it like I normally am for those kinds of things.

            Well the thing is that since making the contract is obviously a bad idea,  the fact that Mami is so pushy with telling them to become Magis in the first two episodes makes you think that she's evil. And then episode 3 rolls around and it turns out she was just an innocent victim. It's very shocking to say the least.

            My reaction was even stronger than that though. Since Mami is the ONLY character I cared about in that show. The ONLY fucking one.
