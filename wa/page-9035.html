            Well,  the Subtle Knife isn't too subtle,  either.

            I thought it was the idea that the knife was so sharp that its cuts were impossibly smooth. Subtle,  if you will.
<p></p>Maybe it's because I didn't know about the other name until later. I read the boo,  and quickly twigged to the meaning of the title after the Alethiometer was introduced.

            @ Lurker: And the twists and turns?
<p></p>It makes far more sense to be the Everfree Castle. The Everfree Forest is basically a maze and the Castle is where they became the Elements of Harmony.

            @Bad Remember who is giving the riddle here. Metaphorically,  "twists and turns" could mean near <em>anything</em>. In fact,  the very fact that they took it at face value was what led to Discord being able to toy with them so easily.

            Tigger,  yeah AJ knows when not to say what's on her mind,  she won't lie about it,  but she won't just come out and say something she knows will hurt another ponies feelings. that's RD's job,  though even then it's more because she doesn't stop to think about how it could hurt there feelings,  not that she doesn't care if it does.

            Also,  random pet peeve. It always bugs me whenever people refer to the mane 6 as if they themselves <em>are</em> the Elements of Harmony,  rather than their <em>bearers</em>. Of course it's all fanon when it comes to what exactly it means to bear an Element,  so you could make a case for them being the physical representations of the Elements themselves. It just bothers me a bit.

            I wouldn't mind if they said in the show that the riddle makes no sense but they don't. They say Twilight got it wrong the first time and right the second time. And her treehouse wasn't the place they first came together as a team,  that was just outside the Everfree and the first time they were physically together was Town Hall.
<p></p>And Twilight does say in "The Elements of Harmony" that they represent the Elements,  not that they bear them.

            Well,  they began looking for the elements in that book,  didn't they? Granted,  they were looking for <em>info</em> on the elements in the book,  but still.
<p></p>And "twists and turns" were his master plan. That is,  it was his plan to tricking them into going into the maze.
