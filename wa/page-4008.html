            More walls oh no. Probably everything’s been said before,  but meh. I take time to do these and I’m not wasting it. <br> <br>So,  I saw some people saying she was being obnoxious at the start,  but what was so obnoxious about her exercising/playing with Pound and Pumpkin? <br> <br>Pinkie has a really,  really good memory. It’s kind of ridiculous. <br> <br>Okay,  I refused to listen to Smile early,  and I’m really really glad I did. That was really nice. The background music,  Pinkie actually singing a long song,  the giant pile of cheer everywhere in the song… She’s right,  I can’t help but Smile. That was a really nice visual joke there,  when she said “sad and blue.” <br> <br>Pinkie needs to sing more parodies. For some reason,  I honestly wasn’t expecting an actual parody of Yankee Doodle,  much less multiple. But it really looks like she thinks her songs are always amazing in her silly,  hilarious imagination. You’d think Cranky would have asked for help in moving his cart. And I can say that I really laughed at “THIS DONKEY IS REALLY REALLY BALD” more than I should have. <br> <br>We need more songs. I don’t think we have enough. <br> <br>…wow. I’ve never been annoyed by Pinkie before,  but she was seriously being obnoxious to Cranky. He totally had a reason to get mad at her. Rifling through his stuff? Being loud about him,  not caring about her machine spewing cake,  destroying his toupee. She’s always ignored people for various reasons,  but this was seriously on the irritating side. <br> <br>Oh hey,  wasn’t expecting the see Aloe and Lotus again,  that was a nice surprise. That background music during the scene was great,  too. Derpy. Derpy,  what are you even doing in there? How did you get there? Stop that. <br> <br>I didn’t catch this the first time,  but when Cranky is yelling at Pinkie,  there’s an angry Yankee Doodle playing in the background. Great little touch there. At least until that,  it looked like Cranky was trying to get rid of her without getting mad and I don’t blame him for yelling. <br> <br>How nice of them to have Rainbow read again. I’m guessing this means that she probably reads a lot more than you’d think. Okay,  Pinkie’s eye looking through the keyhole is really disturbing to me for some reason. Pinkie,  stop being an octopus,  where did those arms even come from? Pinkie fireworks! Pinkie is way too eager to make friends,  if she approached me like how she approached Cranky,  I would try to avoid her,  too.
What was that? Four songs? <br> <br><div class="quoteblock">“make me CRAVE 'I Am' Song's from the other Mane 6”</div>
Yeah,  I think this needs to happen now,  too. I can’t really imagine Applejack singing one,  though. <br> <br>Favorite song is Art of the Dress. I think WWU is nice,  but not as great as some people say. <br> <br>And to whoever said they should be consistent with the background pony voices...why? They don't really care much about them,  it's only the fandom that loves them so much.

            Gentlemen,  and Ginger,  what we have here is a fine episode loaded with comedy,  more songs than your average episode,  and a brand new character who is,  for all intents and purposes,  me. I have a name I don't like to be called,  I prefer the peace and quiet,  and I carry a megaton amount of stuff with me everywhere.
<p></p>And ya know what? Crany was in the right. He was reasonable,  patient,  polite,  and only got worse when Pinkie made things worse,  I mean really,  what she effectively did was bully him for half the episode despite her good intentions and while it probably won't stick the lesson learnt was fair.
<p></p>The ending was utterly nonsensical though

            So I just did a comparison by colour and it looks like the book Dashie's on in Cranky Doodle is the 10th on the shelf in Read It and Weep.  Read It and Weep gives it the Sapphire Stone cover,  though,  since I can see the crocodile.  The res of the copy I'm looking at is too low for me to make out the cover in Cranky Doodle.

<p></p>Meh. I'm not sure. It does have a larger amount of Pinkie than even most Pinkie episodes.

            @Ginger: It's hard to say. Your mileage is different from ours. There are things that may (probably will) annoy you,  but there were quite a few good moments. It's not a simple yes/no thing.

            @Ginger:  Because quite frankly,  I have no idea.  Yes,  Pinkie is more annoying here than any other episode,  but she is called out on it,  which you always say is your biggest issue with her.

            @Kuroi: Well,  if Twilight placed them in chronological order,  that means RD is reading "Gardens of Equestria".
<p></p>@Ginger: Yeah,  I honestly have no clue what you'd think of it.  I can pretty much guarantee that the first five minutes or so will probably be almost painful for you,  but I'm not sure about the rest of the episode.  Pinkie is really annoying due to her obliviousness,  and I know you've expressed dislike for that in the past,  so you might want to pass on this one,  at least for the time being.
