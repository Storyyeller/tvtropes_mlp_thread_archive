            Yeah,  I took a video game programming class my Freshman year in high school. It was pretty frustrating (mostly because the system we had was very finicky and kept finding errors in my stuff,  plus towards the end it didn't work at all so the end of the year eventually devolved into us using the class as "Free Internet Time".) Not really something I'd go in to,  and most of it was just using pre-determined geometric shapes.

            @Story: It depends on where you work. there are bad companies that work you like slaves,  but for the most part the industry is really starting to level out. Most companies don't want you to work too much overtime now.
<p></p>The reason you hear stuff like that is because a lot of beginning designers will work themselves stupid,  and end up burning themselves out in a few years because they work like,  12 hour days. So they end up retiring after 5 years because they just can't work anymore.
<p></p>If you work a decent 9-5,  like I plan to,  it's much easier on you,  though you still need to pull overtime during crunch.
<p></p>The work can be pretty mentally exhausting,  since it's pretty much "Thinking: the job",  but if you don't push yourself too hard it's good work and a lot of fun.
<p></p>@Apple: Don't worry about it. It'll be easier to find work after I move,  and I'll actually be in the city I'm applying for work at.

            I would <em>love</em> to go from my current job of developing utility apps to developing games,  or at least find someone art and design savvy to make use of my prototypes so I could toss an indie game out there for the hell of it. Not looking likely,  though.

            @Colin: You have to check visit all the credits pages first.
<p></p>@Freeman: Goodnight.
<p></p>I took a journalism class in college.  I learned that I <em>suck</em> at journalism.  The whole reason I like writing stuff is the ability to make stuff up and interpret things.  Journalism is all about "just the facts,  no interpretation",  so I almost died.
<p></p>Also,  I'm <em>finally</em> done with all my schoolwork for the year,  so I'm changing my avatar to reflect how good it feels.

            I personally am frustrated with my options. I love to sing. It's one of the few things I love more than reading and video games. The problem is <em>There is no freaking way to turn it into a career</em>. My ideal future career would be a voice actor/singer but I cannot see a way to get into the industry.

            I'm a music major,  hoping I can get a career as an opera singer or musical theatre performer. And next semester I start my accounting major,  so I can do that if the music thing doesn't work.
<p></p>When I was in middle school I really wanted to make video games. But... I know nothing about programming or design. So that's never gonna happen. All I really have are "ideas" and stories and those are a dime a million. So that ain't happening.

            My experiences with people are quite strained,  as I don't really like being around people.
<p></p>I mean,  it's not that I don't LIKE people,  far from it actually,  it's just that I don't like being AROUND people. It's kinda hard to explain,  but being around people tends to drain my thought capacity and in most conversations I just sorta turn into a husk. In my life,  there have only ever been two people that I've ever been able to talk to,  that were my own age,  that I didn't feel like I was forcing conversation with them.
<p></p>I guess that's one thing I sorta like about the internet. I can talk to people without actually having to be in their proximity!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
