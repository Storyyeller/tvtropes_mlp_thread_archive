            @Bluespade:  That's the game you choose to play for relaxation?  Probably not the best choice.  I just picked that up the other day,  but I haven't started it up yet.
<p></p>Why can I never get a pagetopper when I'm actually being on topic?

            one on one? I doubt it. Canonically the only firebender that MAY be more powerful then him is Ozai,  and that ones up for debate,  there at least at the same level.
<p></p>but it's Iroh,  he's more likely to just fix you a cup of tea and talk it over with you then fight unless you REALLY force him.

            Yeah,  Epic Wub time was pretty awesome.
<p></p>I kinda liked Octavia's 'breakdown' at Scratches method of doing the dishes. Seems a bit of an excessive reaction,  but she WAS likely pretty tired. It'd be funny if she turned out to be a bit of a drama queen. Also,  it's ice to see them NOT shipped together for once.

            @ Blue,  it's obvious Rarity made a big deal that she was NOT to wear the hat and mess up the entire ensamble. So the instant she saw Rarity was to teary eyed to see,  she put it on,  AJ just don't feel right without her hat.
<p></p>again THIS is why I bucking LOVE the writers so much,  all the tiny tiny litttle things that show there is way more going on then we see,  it makes Equestria feel like a real living world,  not just a story.

            It also depends if she's eating the energy generated by love or eating your very ability to love.
<p></p>Kyubey for one doesn't actually consume despair or hope,  they really take advantage of the AC effect when Hope turns into despair.
