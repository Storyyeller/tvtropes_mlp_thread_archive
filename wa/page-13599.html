            Good idea spoiled by pacing and arrangement.
<p></p>I would've done a 2-parter,  thus:
<p></p>-Start with Twilight receiving the mystery spell and accidentally invoking it,  wondering what she did and going to bed
-Show everyone waking up and feeling out-of-sorts,  as they gradually exchange places based on their compulsions to do different activities and watch them fail at them until the chaos grows,  eventually calling it to Twilight's attention,  she realizes scope of the problem
Part II:
Solving the problem,  ascension to Princess-hood.

            Okay,  here's what happened.  Twilight was killed by the Elements on her Quest Library,  but because she'd reached the top of her Friecheladder,  she managed to achieve the Princess Tiers.  You can see how Skaia (which doesn't exist just yet) shone with her cutie mark as she Ascended,  and of course we all know that Princess Tier characters get wings.  It's jUst how it is,  darlings! ^U^

            I liked the episode.  I <em>really</em> liked the songs.  The only real complaint I have is that I wish they had spent more time on the initial cutie-mark-swap plot,  since as it was it felt like it was little more than a set-up to the end of the episode rather than a story in its own right.  Then again,  they only had 22 minutes to work with,  so that's easily forgiven.
<p></p>Though now I'm awaiting the inevitable fanfics where Twilight actually got the spell <em>wrong</em> and as punishment the Elements vaporized her.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            @Dark: Basically it looked like they were in outer space.
<p></p>Anyway,  my guess is that Star Swirl was trying to figure out how to ascend into an alicorn. He figured out that the elements were involved,  but couldn't figure out how to make it work (maybe because he himself didn't have any element).

            I suppose the first time the Sisters zapped Discord they went to this wierd place too.
<p></p>It's kinda like that place beyond space and time where a bunch of really bored Hourai schmucks who got tricked into deathlessness hang out and spy on other universe,  only less crowded because.
<p></p>...Starting to wrap up? There are no endings,  only new beginnings :P

            I probably would have slept later,  but my parents woke me up regardless of how quiet they were. On the bright side I don't have to go to take a shower or anything because I was able to do all of that before the episode aired xD
