            time for some more ponies. Dragon Quest
<p></p>great dragon migration? ok then.
<p></p>nice trench they made
<p></p>...damnit rarity,  you were supposed to say friends.
<p></p>oh,  identity crisis episode.
<p></p>will you bozos write a letter to celestia and ask where she got the egg already! You're supposed to be the smart one twi!
<p></p>well...spikes got a point,  the best way to learn about dragons is to go with the dragons.
<p></p>uh...flutershy didn't really disappear for the rest of the episode,  did she?
<p></p>that red dragon looks familiar...
<p></p>nice costume
<p></p>well this was an expected response from the other dragons. <em>especially</em> <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters">the teen dragons.</a>
<p></p>ha! you can tell that adult dragon was thinking "goddamn kids..."
<p></p>Crackle? perfect cartoony explanation for the costume effectiveness! I approve.
<p></p>ah,  spike has found success in failure!
<p></p>oh,  the same phoenix nest we saw on the way over. man,  talk about <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfDetail" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfDetail">Conservation of Detail</a>
<p></p>haw haw,  the hatchlings are too much!
<p></p>ok then,  difficulty of teleport spell is directly proportional to how many bodies are being teleported.
<p></p>wait,  they kept the egg? well,  ok then. I'm sure the phoenix parents wouldn't mind.
<p></p>not a bad episode. please tell me there's gonna some more AJ soon though,  she's had like 10 minutes of screen time through the last 5 episodes it seems.

            I havent been officially diagnosed but all the possibly wrong internet tests Ive taken say I have Aspergers.
<p></p>I dont like to think of myself that way,  I have a fairly normal life... I just like reading cookbooks and procedures and occasionally get fixated on things.
<p></p>Im also pretty socially awkward until I get a few drinks in me.

            Dragon Quest is my favorite Spike episode and the only one I really like. Garble and the other dragons are pretty interesting,  the music is great,  and Spike isn't relatively boring like in his other episodes. <br>Plus,  Crackle.

            Well considering the egg hadnt hatched yet they may have thought it was a dud,  and wouldnt come back for it.  Sometimes unfertilized eggs can be laid or ones where they dont hatch,  usually the female bird eats them to regain some of the nutrients.
