            Personally I can't bring myself to dislike any of the Mane 6,  partly because I can empathise with all of them.,  even Pinkie,  because I've suffered a Party of One-esque breakdown before years ago. Of course,  I've gotten better since then.

            I've had moments where I sympathize with Twilight not wanting to disappoint Celestia. But I do think Lesson Zero was a little overdone.
<p></p>P.S. I just realized the significance of Ace Of Scarab's title. I guess it's a stealth spoiler.

            I love all the Mane 6. The ones I can most identify with are Fluttershy,  and Twilight. I've been at Fluttershy levels of social terror before,  and overall personality is closest to Twi's.

            On the spoilers: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Looks good. All the pets look cool,  but the bat looks cute so I'm hoping for that.</span>
<p></p>As I've said before,  I like all the mane 6,  but Pinkie's my least favourite. <em>Not</em> because of her zaniness. I <em>like</em> zaniness. (Such as Luna from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a>)<em>I'm</em> zany! It's because,  as Ginger has hinted,  with the exception of Party of One (which I loved),  her zaniness <em>always</em> works to her advantage (though I give leeway to Swarm of the Century as well,  because if it was anypony other than Pinkie,  they would have fixed everything in five minutes). I know from experience that that doesn't happen IRL.
<p></p>I think that the best way to get over problems with Pinkie is to realise that the rest of the cast realises that Pinkie is insane.
<p></p>On the other questions that I was never asked myself:
<p></p>1.) Favourite Pony?
<p></p>Twilight. Fluttershy is close second (but I've mentioned this before).
<p></p>2.) Favourite Episode?
<p></p>Tough call. Probably Lesson Zero.
<p></p>3.) What do you think of Pinkie?
<p></p>Addressed.
<p></p>4.) Favourite Background Pony?
<p></p>I'm starting to really like Carrot Top.
<p></p>5.) Would you hug the Great And Powerful Trixie?
<p></p>Um...She wouldn't be my first choice by a long shot,  but if she really wanted one,  I'm cool with giving hugs.

            @To everyone that wants to learn how to draw (ponies or everything)
<p></p>Hey guys here it is what I promised. This are IMO the best resources for learning how to draw. They aren't easy nor fast (quite the contrary) but totally worth it and if you are really serious about art this will help a lot
<p></p><ol><li><a class="urllink" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/17395096/The-New-Drawing-on-the-Right-Side-of-the-Brain">Book drawing from the right side of the brain<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>This book is super basic. It is great to get rid of the symbol system. You won't  be able to create but you will have the skill to copy anything. If you can't draw anything at all this is the book for you
</li><li>10 minutes drawing tecnhiniques. Hands down the best teacher there is. He really teaches how to be an artist from zero by teaching actual art principles.Not your averagae "how to draw anime eyes in 10 steps" teacher trust me on this one... You won't find a better teacher anywhere
</li></ol><p></p>Here is the first lesson
<center><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="425" height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BsQ1WVyPHvU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p></p>Hope it helps :)

            I like all of the cast. Some,  I like more than others. I think that Rarity may be my favorite,  but I can't quite be sure. And while some I like less than others,  I think that may be more a result of my identifying with their personality type less,  or the character not getting as many focal episodes. But I can't say that I <em>dis</em>like any of the characters. In this show,  at least,  I don't think I could ever,  say,  wish that a character would be emotionally broken and not fully recover,  for instance.

            Anyone here probably knows that Twilight takes the number one place for favourite with me by a fair bit.  But I also don't dislike any of them.  I kind of have a fence sitter's ranking of which I like more than the others (as far as the other five go),  but it's better expressed as a point scale than one of those > lists.  Out of ten,  I'd score: Twilight 10,  Fluttershy 9,  Dashie 8.8,  Applejack 8.8,  Pinkie 8.8,  Rarity 8.6.
<p></p>Speaking of drawing,  the one I did tonight is kind of a cheap and cheesy one,  but <a class="urllink" href="http://no-contest-creations.com/2011/11/18/mlp-fim-true-story/">it's totally a true story<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

<p></p>The episode is on at 3 tomorrow,  right? Or for other time zones a day and 8 hours.

            My favourite is Twilight,  but not by a whole lot. I also have lots of love for Rarity. Yeah,  she can be a bit selfish but she really does <em>try</em>,  and that's always counted for almost as much in my book as doing. In a lot of cases,  even more. Fluttershy comes at third,  and is pretty right in the middle. She's cute enough to secure the spot,  but personality wise I'm sort of ambivalent. The more thing is getting old,  but she's dynamic enough that I can still like her. AJ has slid up into fourth place,  and just behind her is Dash,  with Pinkie trailing behind.
<p></p>As far as Background ponies go I like a lot of them,  but for favorites I'd either have to say Pokey Pierce or Ziggy Stardust (Gee,  two background ponies who I wrote about,  big surprise)
<p></p>I'm abivialent to Pinkie,  and while I like Trixie well enough I doubt I'd hug her,  as neither she nor I are terribly huggy people. Er... you know.
<p></p>As for favourite episode... hm. Green is not your colour is a huge contender,  definitely. I love how Rarity and Fluttershy play off each other in every single scene,  and it has some of Fluttershy's funniest moments. Plus,  I really do like a lot of the stuff Rarity designs. It's really neat to look at.

            Hmmm,  guess I'll finish the survey.
<p></p>2.) Favourite Episode?
It's really close for me.  Cutie Mark Chronicles edges everything else out,  but Lesson Zero and Winter Wrap Up are such close contenders that I just have to mention them.
<p></p>3.) What do you think of Pinkie?
<p></p>She's grown on me a bit,  although I never disliked her.  It's just that she and Twi are the only one who have moved position at all since season 1 ended.
<p></p>4.) Favourite Background Pony?
<p></p>Don't really have any.  I kind of like certain colour schemes a bit more than others,  but I'm more of a characterization over aesthetics person,  and none of the fanon interpretations have taken much hold of me,  so no pony pulls far enough ahead of the others.
<p></p>5.) Would you hug the Great And Powerful Trixie?
<p></p>Well,  I might try.  I don't think it would end well,  though,  unless Trixie is really a softy at heart.

            I don' know,  though. She's buried in there pretty deep,  you'd have to get close to her to be able to get a real hug.
<p></p>But then,  I think I might like that. I know people who are a lot worse with her and,  despite everyone I know somehow coming under the impression that I'm an angry person,  I can be extremely patient and sympathetic with people like Trixie.

            1.) Favourite Pony?
<p></p>Rainbow Dash. These next two episodes are going to be great for me. I hope she sings in one of the, 
<p></p>2.) Favourite Episode?
<p></p>Sonic Rainboom. The Sonic Rainboom itself was the first thing I saw of the series when I was looking for Guile Theme videos,  so it has a sentimental place in my heart as the reason I watched the show.
<p></p>3.) What do you think of Pinkie?
<p></p>She sings the most. Her songs are easy to remember. This is a good thing. Hell rarely a day goes by that I won't just start singing the Fear or Cupcakes song. This usually happens in public. I don't care still great.
<p></p>4.) Favourite Background Pony?
<p></p>Pokey Pierce. He is the best.
<p></p>5.) Would you hug the Great And Powerful Trixie?
<p></p>Yes. How that would turn out is unknown but at least I'll have done it. Hell if I ever get to Equestria I'm hugging everything,  it will be my quest.
<p></p>Super Bonus Question.) Favourite non-background,  non-mane cast character?
<p></p>Luna maybe. Spike's pretty cool but he's not a pony. Zecora would be the best if she was a pony. *Edits question* Yes Zecora is the best.

            I don't really know about give.  I kind of imagine it like Dashie says she wants to hold auditions or something like that,  so gets her to ask any interested animals to attend.  Then she picks out the top ones,  which end up being the ones from the screeny to test with a race.  Probably won't happen that way because it'd be an awful lot of screen time used up,  but eh.
<p></p>Pinkie doesn't sound much different to me.
