            The Flim Flams being the Flim Flams,  I don't think we can take it as fact that they were the ones who invented that machine. Given that I like to think of them as two halves of one whole Harold Hill,  I like to imagine they won it off an actual inventor.
<p></p>Also,  any time we've seen more modern technology,  ie fans and the like,  it seems to me there's been an Earth Pony to do with it. Although that may be extrapolating.

            I'm with Blissey on that one,  and for the same reason - my characters grew from use,  and even now,  when I roleplay it's amazing how much my characters change and grow when I compare them to their character sheets.

            Also,  Ditto what Red and Blissey said. Trying to force it isn't going to end well.  Let the characters develop in whatever direction they do.

            Well I'll try.
<p></p>And speaking of inventors,  time to reintroduce you all to my Earth Pony inventor who builds machines powered by soda pop.  He's a shout out to both Scotty from Star Trek,  and Franky from One Piece.
<p></p>EDIT: He's also a bit like a fantasy dwarf.
<p></p>Though as I write this...maybe he should be a combo of Franky and Usuop.

<p></p>He's a dwarf pony right?  Except he's a bit of a runt.  The typical dwarf pony is a massive,  muscular and bearded tank.  He's...kinda skinny,  and can't grow a proper (by their standards) bread.  But he's smart.
<p></p>It fits a theme of the crew being 'odd ones out' from their home communities.

            I have too ideas actually:
<p></p>1. His 'hold' made it's fortune mining truffles.  Bare in mind,  there are species of truffles that are,  pound for pound,  worth more than gold.  Until Hogz raided and destroyed it,  carrying his family off into slavery.  Thus like a Dwarf hating the Greenskins,  he hates all Hogz.  But this seems <em>way</em> too dark for the setting.
<p></p>2. He's an exile from the gild of engineers,  because his unorthodox machines fail to meet approved practices.  And he caused a huge suds explosion too.

I am a (fanfic) writer and I definitely agree with this. Some amount of planning is good,  but one eventually reaches a point of diminishing returns,  and the planning just becomes a way to procrastinate on actually doing.
<p></p>For the story I'm writing,  I had an outline for what I wanted to do,  and a very vague idea for my ending. Feedback from my pre-readers made me completely overhaul my planned ending—and this was feedback just on my first chapters. I hadn't told anyone how I planned to end the story,  but comments about "What the heck is the significance of this?" made realize that a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowTools" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowTools">Cow Tools</a> in my story could be repurposed as <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhovs Guns</a>.
<p></p>Even aside from pre-reader feedback,  some of the characters changed as I wrote them. I needed a minor antagonist for a scene in the first chapter,  and I picked Cloudchaser solely because I really like her mane. Then I reused Cloudchaser in a later chapter,  because I wanted to show that she wasn't a jerk 24/7,  and she ended up coming across like she was just unhappy with her job. Then I used that as a punchline in a later chapter. And Carrot Top! I didn't have any personality planned for her,  but feedback helped me turn her from the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a> into a prankster in her own right,  and the sort of pony who can say ridiculous things with a completely straight face.

            @Applelight: Blissey has a point.  One thing I've noticed about your brainstorming things is that while you have a lot of interesting ideas,  you're constantly trying to stuff new things in and rethinking everything without ever actually getting started on the story.  I'd say just nail down the absolute core of his character (the stuff that you know you aren't going to change),  start writing with that as a basis,  and add or remove the other stuff as the story requires.
