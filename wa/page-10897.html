            I wonder how you would fix that. I guess a few measures you could take is,  try to force people to at least load the story before rating it,  make them rate it on several scales,  and use machine learning to weight the results. I'm not sure how well that would work even then,  but it'd be worth a try.

            I think most rating systems tend to be a bit borked that way.  Having the rate option only appear at the bottom of chapters might help a bit,  though that would only work on sites like fimfiction that host the stories themselves.

            I pretty much <em>only</em> gave out 2-4 star ratings. It would have to be really high-quality,  feels-inducing,  and unforgettable for me to give it a 5. Conversely,  it would have to be the most horrid crap that I have ever subjected my eyes to <em>that I somehow still manage to finish at least halfway</em> for me to give out a 1.

            @Kyler:  This is pretty much how I try to rate things.  It's actually a little hard for me to do because I tend to not be that critical of fiction,  but I feel like too many people give out 5s to everything they like even a little,  which basically makes them worthless.  Maybe there should be a cap on them.  Like you can only give five stars to so many fics per month.

            I just think that there needs to be more reviews and feedback. For as creative as the fandom is,  I almost <em>never</em> see critique unless it is specifically sought out. You'd at least expect a tumblr or two dedicated to reviewing featured fics,  wouldn't you?
<p></p>I actually had a funny idea the other day that I don't have the artistic talent to pull off. Basically,  it would be like one of those Ask Blogs,  except that the pony in question would review fanfiction in-character. It would be a huge undertaking,  though,  so I doubt that anything could ever come of it. I might actually consider trying it if I could team up with an artist.

            @marston:  What are you talking about?  Lesbians and gay dudes are totally different things!
<p></p>Yeah,  it is a double standard,  but I think it's just a minority of assholes.  Most people don't bother rating a fic,  so the few jerks that downvote because of that stand out more.
<p></p>@story:  That's basically what Netflix does,  and it would be cool to see it implemented more places.  Probably pretty difficult to pull off though.
