<p></p>YMMV to the whole thing,  obviously. I found Season 3 to be amazing. Character arcs were followed up on,  massive shifts in the status quo occurred,  and when none of that happened,  the comedy was great to make up for it. The finale itself is probably one of the most emotionally charged episodes of anything I've watched ever,  and while it may be compressed,  it doesn't <em>lose</em> anything by being compressed.

            I feel like it would've been just fine if they split it at the last 7 minutes,  then developed each piece into its own episode.  Twilicorn could have been good as the climax of a 2-parter starting with Mystery Cure,  or even as something appropriately built up to in a 1-parter,  and Mystery Cure could stand on its own — but just kinda compressing both to tack Twilicorn on the way they did with inadequate connection was enough of a disservice to both plots that it rather thoroughly killed both for me.

            Re:  The Bullying Episode
<p></p>I thought it was very well done.  The "bully becoming friends with the bullied" may seem cliche,  but it is realistic.  Some bullies become bullies due to being bullied themselves (one of more stupid aspects of Peer Pressure).
<p></p>I did want to (facepalm) when the CMC didn't just tell the adults,  especially since they recognized that they were being bullied.  But I also get that they wanted to handle the matter themselves,  which at least shows that they weren't taking the bullying passively.
<p></p>When I was a kid - yeah,  a few of my classmates did try to bully me,  but I was... let's just say - so distracted by so many other way more cooler things to be concerned about than social standings (in school),  that I did not even recognize -that- was bullying until years later.

            Yeah,  pretty much from the point where Little Pip was in the memory of Pinkamina I just read through it in a day. I get why things ended how they did and it's great that most of the cast and Equestria gets a bittersweet ending,  but Little Pip just ends up screwed. She can only comunicate to the outside world in messages,  loses Homage,  and will never get to see her friends just when she realizes how much she needs them. It's hard to love the ending when our protagonist never really wins.

Li'lpip controls the defenses for the SPP she can let homage through the shields. And can leave the pod for short amounts of time I believe. And it's not just through messages she can communicate with them just fine,  it just took her awhile to figure out the systems. Plus,  being in the SPP will extend her life far past what it would have been shotended to otherwise. So yes she can' leave the SPP hub,  but the others can come visit her,  and she can stay in touch all the time.</span>

            Either I was a bit dense and missed something in the epilogue,  or it must have been a bit subtle.
<p></p>Speaking of fanfics,  are their any longish ones of good quality I can read? Having read <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoE" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoE">Fo E</a>,  I guess I can take just about anything at this point. My internet over here isn't very great so it'll be easier downloading chapters I can read between <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiFi" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiFi">Wi Fi</a> crashes.

<p></p>Which begs the question,  who (<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> person or character) deserves to be in the MLP Hall of Fame? <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust">Lauren Faust</a> is an obvious pick,  Firefly was <em>the</em> G1 pony,  and they'll probably have Pinkie Pie in there <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">because</a> <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter">reasons</a>. Doesn't something from G3 deserve a passing mention? Think they'll allow fan-voted characters like the TF Hall of Fame (if they do,  I have a feeling only G4 characters would win every year :P)?
<p></p>This is actually kinda interesting,  I'm surprised I haven't heard they were planning an official Hall of Fame thingie until now.
