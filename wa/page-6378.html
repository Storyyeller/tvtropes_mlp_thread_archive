            Yeah,  that wasn't Rarity's finest moment.  Although you do have to give her a little credit for being Twilight's guinea pig,  given how often Twilight's spells backfire...

            @Kyler: I'm pretty sure that by the time she was that far gone,  she'd be too weak to actually do much harm.  Heck,  in Applebuck Season she could barely buck the trees.  I doubt that if she went much further that she'd be able to do much.

            Initially,  Rarity was my second leasy favorite since Sonic Rainboom was the fourth epiosde I ever saw,  and Rarity was barely in the first three. But after watching more episodes,  I saw the light.

            Except the whole reason we talk about these things here is that we like the people here we are talking about them with. And it's just a hassle to get everyone in the same other thread,  if people really have issues or have some other topic we stop and switch,  but better off just talking as friends then just letting the thread sit dead.

            I don't think that was an ego thing,  she had no problem when her friends had excuses that she thought were valid.  She only got upset when she thought they were lying to avoid her.

            No,  that's Pinkie's codependence. She didn't feel insulted or outshone,  she felt betrayed and abandoned. The issue is that the only thing she's really proud of is being everyone's friend,  and you can't get an ego from that.
<p></p>In other news,  I've got less than an hour to finish tonight's homework assignment,  so I think I'll leave the thread now.
<p></p>P.S. Triple ninja'd.

            I'd actually like to see an episode where the others get tired of Pinkie's parties and they challenge her to go a specific period of time without throwing one. Then Pinkie has withdrawal symptoms. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
