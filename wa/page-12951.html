            I get even more exhausted than usual at kayak training,  mess up a batch of wheatpaste,  therefore delaying new year's eve preparations even more,  discover part of the meat we had for tomorrow was unusable,  finish for the day,  come here and find out I missed out on the good discussions,  while the current one's yet another morality discussion about Equestria vs. reality.

            <div class="quoteblock">Also,  I'm kinda curious what's so terrible about the idea that ponies might be considered inherently friendlier than humans. I get that it's no excuse for Humans Are Bastards style bashing on reality,  but I don't think there's anything wrong with creating a setting inhabited by characters who are naturally nicer. (Note,  I'm not saying they are,  just asking why some people are so opposed to the concept.)</div>
<p></p>I guess there is nothing inherently bad about the idea itself,  I just don't really like the subtle (or not so subtle at times) implications that the only reason they are overcoming their problems is because they are better then us humans. Not to mention it just seems to fly in the face that ponies do in fact act like humans,  hell we even got a taste of how nasty they could be in the past. And yes,  we haven't seen ponies do some of the really nasty things that humans have done,  but lets be honest is that because they are just like that? Or is it a product of the genre and demographic of the show itself. Keep in mind that if the show had been with humans very little would likely change in the characters personalities and the society.

            My basic take is that crime in general is probably lower in Equestria.  I mean,  let's face it,  based on what we've actually seen in the show,  I don't think there's really any way to claim that Equestria has say,  a violent crime rate comparable to reality.
<p></p>Of course,  we can argue it up and down all day,  given that it comes down to interpretation in the end.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I think saying "the world is nice either because it is,  or because it's a kids show" is a bit of a false dichotomy; the show can both be for kids,  and also have a setting that just happens to be idealized.  Because honestly,  I don't find the converse much better; it's basically saying "idealized settings are for children".  I'm not saying that adults should partake in childish escapism and not address the relevant issues,  just that in the case of this particular show,  the fact that it's choosing not to address the darker elements of human nature doesn't necessarily make the setting any less believable in itself.
<p></p>Basically,  I don't think the show is <em>trying</em> to portray a realistic picture of human society.  That's not the point.  The point is to show a slightly more idealized world to teach lessons.  The point is to point at a situation and say "this is a good way of resolving the issue" with the point of getting people to resolve issues in this manner.  It has to be at least slightly idealized,  because if it wasn't it would be nonstop <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyAesop" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyAesop">Family Unfriendly Aesop</a>.
<p></p>The question basically boils down to:
<p></p>Is the setting realistic,  and all the nasty stuff is just edited out because of the demographic?
<p></p>or
<p></p>Did the creators intentionally create an idealized setting to make imparting the lessons easier?
<p></p>My personal view of it is that Equestria is basically to show what life could be like if people made an effort to be nicer.  The ponies aren't necessarily better than people,  but because there's so much encouragement to cooperate rather than an "everyone for themselves" mentality,  life is much nicer for them.

            Sorry if OT,  but I finally forced my brother to watch the very first episode of the show tonight. I know he was exposed to the show through other means,  but out-of-context pictures and clips aren't very representative of the series,  so I showed him the first episode so he would know what it was like. After it was finished,  despite me showing him some of the pony/heavy-metal fan art,  as well as telling him that it has writers from Spongebob on it,  he still doesn't get why people are obsessed over it. All I can say is...THANK GOD!
<p></p>Now if you excuse me,  I have to contemplate my life miserably knowing I may have just committed mortal sin...

<p></p>A lack of organized religion outside of a few,  obviously real,  "deities" probably has something to do with that.

Gilda sure seemed to have a thing against ponies in general...

<p></p>Actually,  you might as well.  And don't say "because it's aimed at kids",  because the whole question is "Do these things exist in the setting and we just don't see them because of the demographic,  or do they just not exist in the setting period?"

            It's basically the fact that nobody <em>wants</em> stories about that in this genre.  This is fantasy-slice-of-life,  not a crime drama or something like Game of Thrones. Take shows that are more or less set in the "real" world,  like,  say,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seinfeld" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a>. How often does a show like that acknowledge ongoing rape and genocide in the world? Does that mean that those don't exist in that universe? Could be,  who knows? Nothing changes the fact that the show is never going to touch on them directly for sake of genre.
