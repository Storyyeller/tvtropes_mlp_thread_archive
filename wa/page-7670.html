It refines it to a pure essecence that you would not beleive possible,  making the Bourne triliogy look like a model of clear camera work. It 's difficult to exaggerate how bad the shaky cam in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHungerGames" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a> is. For scenes not set in the capital,  you can literally count the number of times the camera is stationary even breifly on the fingers of one hand. This is not an exaggeration,  I counted.

            @Steve: I think the main issue there is that you can get away with a lot more in a book than you can in a movie.  And it's not so much an issue of "this is aimed at teens" so much as "A lot of the fans are teens" and making it R-rated could damage that.  On one level,  yeah,  it's stupid,  but on the other hand I doubt that making the violence more graphic or whatnot would really make the story that much better anyway.
<p></p>Also,  didn't you just start following me on twitter?

            Sometimes less is more when it comes to violence. Sometimes it can have more impact if it's less graphic.

            @JT then they could've toned down the violence of the scenes themselves.
<p></p>Making the action scenes all but unwatchable due to camera shaking is NOT the way to go about dealing with your ratings problem

            Would I be shot if I said that having no familiarity with the canon of Transformers I think the movies were okay? (If you cut out the first half hour from the second and third movie that is.)

            My only problem with the film was that they diminished Rue's role. She got a lot more focus in the book.
<p></p>But that's balanced out by them changing that thing with the muttations near the end which,  let's face it,  was kinda stupid and didn't make any sense.

            The lack of an interesting characters was what sunk the movie for me though.
<p></p>I thought the antagonist was the most sympathetic character and even HE was lame!

            Well from what little I've seen,  the Transformers has it's own issues with editing. It takes place in an alternate universe where the only colors that exist are orange and bright blue.

            @Ginger: Yeah,  that's just stupid.
<p></p>I'm in the same boat as Steve.  They were hardly great cinema,  but they were watchable if you're just in it to see robots fighting.  Too much Shia Lebouf,  though. I'm still not entirely sure what the plot was,  but hey,  robots.

            Yeah,  I liked the film as well. Although to be honest,  I didn't really enjoy the second and third books that much. I like the creativity the author puts into it for the actual world,  but when the love triangle gets so in your face like that,  it becomes really annoying. I like romance to kind of build up slowly. And when the romance aspect overtakes the "YOU'RE IN A FREAKING ALTERNATE UNIVERSE AND THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON!" plot,  I lost my respect for the series. But the first one's good because the romance aspect is kind of hidden.
