<p></p>You know I wonder what Tank does when he is not hanging out with Rainbow Dash. Is there just some helicopter tortoise flying around Ponyville without a care in the world? Hmm,  I wonder how the flower sisters would react?

            Yeah,  but in Sisterhooves Social,  Rarity at least has that moment of "Oh crap,  I've been a terrible sister".  She realized that she had screwed up and went to Applejack for advice on how to fix her relationship.  The initiative was on Rarity's side.  In this episode,  RD seems to be totally oblivious to the problem until the cast spells it out for her.  If she would have realized "Crap,  I've been being an egotistical jerk" before the unmasking,  I think it would have worked a lot better.

<p></p>EDITED IN: That and how Applejack was utterly in denial of needing help with farming when it was causing harm to others. The closest to that I can think of for Twilight within the first season is <em>Swarm Of The Century, </em> and even there the problems weren't exactly caused by Twilight's actions.

            I'm real happy for you all,  and Imma let you finish,  but I'm going to talk about what I thought of the new episode.
<p></p>I have to say,  this was probably my least favorite episode so far. Not just 1,  but 5 of the Mane 6 are carrying the Idiot Ball. Why are they suddenly so bothered by Rainbow's arrogance? It's one of her main character traits,  and when you've known someone for as long as the Mane 6 have,  you'd get used to it. And of course they couldn't just tell Rainbow to tone down the ego a bit,  they had to try and destroy her reputation. I've always wanted to see a plot like this or Party of One,  except in the end the character in question storms off angrily. But because this is a kids show,  that's not going to happen.

            I find this episode a lot easier to handle if you imagine that the ENTIRE MMDW thing was orchestrated PURELY to give the cast a chance to talk to RD. As she was,  she was NEVER going to listen to anyone.
<p></p>All she needed was to hear someone call her out on it (as the mane cast did at the end),  but the problem was GETTING her to listen in the first place
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> RD doesn't listen to anyone unless she's suffered some kind of humiliation,  though.

But now I think she's alright. She's not so egotistical that she wouldn't have listened to her friends. The thing that bothered me more was the Mane 6 suddenly being bothered by one of Rainbow's biggest traits. That would be like them trying to get Twilight not to be studious.

            Just to reiterate: <em>They didn't humiliate RD in any way.</em>  They didn't set her up for failure or make her look like an idiot.  They just did the same things that she had been doing.  Any humiliation she suffered was the result of her own actions.  They never impeded her or prevented her from doing anything.  I agree that it's weird that they jumped straight to this plan rather than trying to talk to her about it,  but I don't think that's enormously stupid of them.
<p></p>The problem was that RD was far and away more arrogant in this episode than she's ever been before,  to the point that it's endangering ponies.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I can see your point concerning this episode,  but I really don't think that throwing someone a surprise party is a deal-breaker.  The problem was totally on Pinkie's end for that one.
<p></p>@Ginger: I enjoyed the episode,  just not as much as most of the others.

            The other thing is that from day one,  RD's self worth has pretty much always been determined by how others view her.  I mean look at Sonic Rainboom: She had a total nervous breakdown when faced with the possibility that she might look like an idiot in front of a lot of ponies.  It really makes sense that when she gets praise heaped on her,  she'd never want to give that up if she could help it.
<p></p>But yeah,  it's weird that her friends jumped right to the plan that they did.  If I had been in their position,  I'd have faked some sort of disaster that resulted in one of her friends being (not really) hurt as a result of her posturing.  Cue "What have I done!?" moment at which point she connects the dots.

            Another thing that bugged me was the scene with the Mane 6 talking about MMDW to RD. A good thing to do would've been to say "MMDW is better than you because she's humble and modest" so RD would emulate that to be the best. But they decided to rub it in her face,  which was pretty mean.
<p></p>Also,  when RD was out of problems,  I was so surprised she didn't decide to pull a Twilight and make some problems.

            Well,  it was brought up that they were trying to show RD how self-praise and such can be annoying.
<p></p>Still though,  it feels pretty roundabout to me.
