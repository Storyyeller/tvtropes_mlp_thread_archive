            @Psi Actually,  the music is what allowed them to get as much into the episode as they did. Imagine how long the sequence of discovering what the spell had done to each of the pony would be if it wasn't a musical montage.

            As said two numbers worked in well and moved things forward,  the others just slowed it down or ruined the mood.

            When I watched the episode,  I watched it with my dad (who has seen several other MLP episodes) and he had a comment that I liked.  He said that he liked how the girls got their cutie marks back by re-trying the activities they used to do and remembering how much they liked them,  this being the most obvious with Fluttershy.  As opposed to Twilight doing something like a memory spell on them.  So they all helped each other and helped themselves regain their memories and real cutie marks back by doing it on their own rather than having Twilight fix it for them.  I realized that was a really good aspect of the story that Twilight led her friends to places where they could rediscover their talents,  but they had to rediscover them on their own,  not with her using a spell to make them remember.  Also,  that way they also avoid something that might make people think "Twilight brainwashed her friends just to maintain the status quo!" like how some people complained about the memory spell she used on them after Discord messed with them.
<p></p>He also thought Fluttershy looked sad at the end,  although that might be because of her "sad eyes" or <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tareme" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tareme">Tareme</a> expression.  I didn't really notice her looking sad myself.

            @Psi I respectfully disagree,  then. Kinda hard for a song to ruin the mood when its the song that sets the mood to begin with.

            I just feel a better climax could have been made without some of them. It may have worked with one or two songs like standard episodes,  but <em>six</em> I feel shot it down and some of them just felt narmy and irritating. As said though,  I may be biased since I tend to dislike the songs.

<p></p>And also,  this episode really demonstrated that all ponies have magic.  Hence the glowing.  I now believe that any tribe could pull a power of love moment using their inner magic.

        <div class="post-content">
            My thoughts,  after my initial viewing and after letting 8 hours pass.  I originally intended to make this short and simple.  Then I got carried away:
<p></p>The writers created Twilicorn without breaking the world or the character.  I would have liked to see more worldbuilding RE alicorns (it left several questions hanging),  but it did the job.  We didn't get to see much of the "fallout" from Twilight's ascension (i.e.,  "now what?"),  so it'll be important to see how that's handled in Season 4.
<p></p>Speaking of Season 4; if Celestia's words are anything to go by,  there are going to be some major changes,  probably both in-universe and in terms of the writing and storylines.  How exactly Season 4 will differ from the first 3 is anyone's guess.  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">Cerebus Syndrome</a> is certainly on my mind,  but I could be completely wrong.  Regardless,  they don't seem to be slapping wings on Twilight,  changing nothing else,  and calling it a day.  Even bearing in mind fears of shark-jumping,  I'd say this is a good thing.  Making a major change in Twilight like this and then going back to business-as-usual would be poor form,  and after 2.5 seasons of the same basic format,  shaking things up is probably a good idea.  I'm really eager to see exactly where they go with this.
<p></p>And the term "alicorn" is canon now (not just as the name of the Amulet).  So that's just awesome.
<p></p>The ep itself was...good,  but definitely flawed.  Good material,  as usual; songs (Celestia Sings!),  jokes (Pinkie Spit-take!),  character interaction,  fan shoutouts (<em>Derpy!!!</em>) etc.,  were all well-done,  and there was a lot of it.  As for the ascent/coronation itself,  I don't think I can begin to complain about that section.
<p></p>But the way that material was organized detracted from the ep.  Mainly because yes,  the pacing definitely felt rushed,  and the Cutie Mark-switching section felt rather tacked-on as a result.  I'd really have liked to see Twilight's final test be something more weighty and taxing (e.g.,  The Royal Wedding or The Return of Harmony),  since passing it is such a Big Deal,  and the "payoff" is so significant.  The Cutie Mark-switching story was good,  but run-of-the-mill as the show's <strike>plots</strike> storylines go,  and this cheapened the ascent and coronation's emotional impact.
<p></p>Honestly,  though,  I'm not sure there was a way around that; they essentially had 11 minutes to work with.  Many people have already said it,  and many more will say it; this would have been <em>way</em> better as a two-parter (and with the story's conflict expanded to match).  Sadly,  that's not for the writers to decide.  It's especially disheartening because the writers,  animators,  <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VAs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VAs">V As</a>,  and composers clearly brought their A-Games,  both for us and for the kids.
<p></p>I'm tempted to call it a "noble failure",  but the material that's in the ep is too good for that descriptor.  Still,  it's hard to watch it without seeing the missed potential.  I've felt like the show was harmed by its time constraints before (again,  The Royal Wedding and The Return of Harmony spring to mind),  but never as severely as this.
<p></p>At the end of the day,  though,  the ep was entertaining,  if flawed,  and Twilight's coronation seems to have left the spirit and world of the show intact.  We'll have to wait for Season 4 to know for certain.  The ep itself may represent a stumble,  but as far as I'm concerned,  we can put away the shark tank and waterskis for now.

            @Lurker: I'd not like the setup,  but still accept it's good from another point of view. However even trying to see it non biased,  I feel some of the numbers ruined the pacing and drama,  and I ended up thinking the non musical elements got rushed through.
<p></p>It wasn't a terrible episode from that perception,  but it was very flawed. Season Three as a whole just felt marred by time and compression issues and wasting way too much time on minor details rather than the main plot that a lot of episodes don't reach their proper potential.

            I think the episode has pacing issues (I'm writing my review on it right now,  and half of it basically me explaining why I think it should have been a two-parter),  but I honestly think that the songs helped mitigate it. I would have prefered a non-musical two parter to what we got,  but I also think that the musical montages are what saved this episode from being painfully compressed.
