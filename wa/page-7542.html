            I know we've passed the FOE discussion but I was dragged away to watch AGOT (The Spice Lord is the best character EVER!! XD) so one last rebuttal.
<p></p>The only OC from that fic who seems to have gotten the Awesome-ify treatment is Goldenblood,  and again,  I'm not sure how the fic handles it

            @Blue: Although,  given that her entire show apparently consisted of her standing on stage and talking about how awesome she was,  I can't really blame them.  It would be like going to a Vegas show where instead of doing any tricks,  the magician just stands on the stage and tells you about how awesome they are without ever performing any.  And if you heck he challenges you to a fight.  The closest she comes to doing actual magic is her lightshow,  and even that's mostly pyrotechnics.
<p></p>That said I think both sides have a point; the audience is taking Trixie's boasting too seriously when it's rather obviously exaggerated,  and Trixie <em>does</em> get applause out of her attacks,  so she's not a total failure.  On the other hand,  building your entire show around attacking the audience is a pretty jerky thing to do,  especially when their criticisms are correct.

            Trixie would have done a little better if she actually performed on stage,  The fireworks are nice and all but they really don't make a show.

            @JT um,  IIRC she only stopped to tell the Ursa story because RD flew up on stage and DEMANDED an explanation for why she was so awesome. Before that,  she WAS doing tricks (conjuring a bouquet of flowers)

            Trixie's show isn't exactly built around humiliating others. We see her doing tricks in the background,  it's when AJ,  Rarity and Rainbow become extremely vocal that she tries to shut them down. And outside of the five main characters there the audience loves it.

            Still doesn't change the fact that she responded in the worst possible way to ponies heckling her. Both parties were at fault,  and the fact that her friends were acting in such a way was actually the driving force behind Twilight refusing to step up,  so it wasn't exactly pointless.

            <div class="quoteblock">Although,  given that her entire show apparently consisted of her standing on stage and talking about how awesome she was,  I can't really blame them. It would be like going to a Vegas show where instead of doing any tricks,  the magician just stands on the stage and tells you about how awesome they are without ever performing any. And if you heck he challenges you to a fight. The closest she comes to doing actual magic is her lightshow,  and even that's mostly pyrotechnics. </div>
<p></p>If you look closely,  you can see her conjuring a boquet of flowers out of air. I think she actually did have a standard magician repitoire,  it just got interuppted.
