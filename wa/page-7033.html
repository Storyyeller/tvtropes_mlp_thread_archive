            @Ginger The thing is,  Skills are just another facet of Character,  so developing skills along with characterization makes for better and more complete <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>. Ignoring one or the other is overall quite harmful to a show's quality. Action oriented shows don't get a free pass on characterization,  so I don't see why slice-of-life shows should get a free pass on skills,  despite the fact that many do.

<p></p>except why shouldn't they,  one of the biggest drawing points for this show is how realistically the world is portrayed...once you except the whole magical neon ponies thing anyway...the way the girls abilites are portrayed,  is just like how it would happen IRL,  do YOU stay at the exact same skill level for years in everything? no! why should they? the whole point of the show is seeing the ponies grow and learn,  and to do that they need to change. But it's handle REALISTICALLY,  not just according to how "The Big Book Of How To Write The Same Boring Trash Over And Over" says things should be,  but how it actaully logicaly would be,  they don't make a big deal about it,  but it's just there.
