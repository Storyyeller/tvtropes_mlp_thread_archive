<p></p>Essentially,  in Faust's plans,  Scootaloo actually <em>is</em> handicapped,  and probably wouldn't ever be able to fly. The episode would deal with the difference between unreachable dreams and aspirations (being exactly like Rainbow Dash) and discovering what you <em>can</em> do with the talents you're given to realize your own destiny (her scooter skills).
<p></p>Wow. Even in canon,  Scootaloo couldn't escape the sad story concepts,  which is probably why she hasn't gotten an episode yet.
<p></p>Depressing pagetopper,  ho!

            I can't believe I am saying this,  but I am glad Lauren Faust left.  Presumably the Scootaloo episode will be more cheerful and less heartbreaking than all that.

The closest that the show has gotten to <em>really</em> striking a sad,  emotional chord,  IMO,  was when Pinkie accidentally burned Cranky's scrapbook,  and even then it wasn't really given enough time to sink in too deep.

            Poor Scoots indeed,  but to show she has other talents she can aspire for is what I'd call a positive note. Furthermore,  I WANT THIS EPISODE! I'm not even a Scootaloo fan but anything that develops the underdeveloped is good enough for me.

            Yeah,  I'm not sure how I'd feel about an episode like that.  On one hand,  I really think that the show could tackle subject matter like that and make it work,  but on the other hand,  I kinda agree with what Bluespade said.  There's lots of stuff out there that tackles depressing themes,  and it's kinda nice to have at least <em>one</em> show that's more or less happy the whole way through (which is also why I generally dislike <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFic">Dark Fic</a> about it).  Basically,  I think the show could do it,  but I'm not sure if I'd <em>want</em> it to.  That,  and I don't think it's really necessary to give Scoots a disability to make that point,  and it would be <em>really</em> easy for it to come off as a "token wheelchair kid" kinda thing.  And dangit,  Scootaloo deserves to have at least some part of her character be not depressing.

            Well. . .that concept. . . honestly I would rather Scootaloo <em>not</em> be disabled,  cause I don't think it would make sense to bring it up at this point,  and because I just know how the fandom would react to that. -_-

If it were contained in the show it would be kinda okay,  but I just know the fandom would exaggerate it,  and Scootaloo gets enough crap in the fandom that making her disabled would be throwing fuel on the fire.
<p></p>And there's nothing <em>specifically</em> depressing about her in the <em>show</em> per se,  it's more the fandom interpretation.  I.e. no family,  no friends outside the CMC,  can't fly,  Scootabuse,  Scootachicken,  etc.  Basically I'd rather not have the <em>one</em> new bit of information we get about Scootaloo's character be something negative because the fandom already basically spins everything we know into something nasty anyway.

            Would lack of flight for a pegasus that's never flown really be that big of a handicap?  She's never had it so its not like she'd have to learn to cope with not being able to do it.

            I do enjoy the general tone of the show,  but one of the things that I really give it credit for is the sheer range that it has,  and that it's not afraid to shift that tone to empower a scene. I'd actually consider a more mature episode to be a credit to the show as a whole,  so long as it can maintain its cheerful tone elsewhere.
<p></p>I do have to revise what I consider to actually be the actual <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> moment in the show so far,  though,  and it would have to be the BBBFF reprise in A Canterlot Wedding. That,  combined with the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a> to a legitimately scary moment made it <em>really</em> powerful,  IMO.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Having enough propulsion to almost lift herself off the ground and propel her scooter,  but not enough to actually take flight would still count as a handicap in my book. In the context of the setting,  it's not one that would actively hinder her quality of life,  but still a handicap all the same. Of course,  none of it is canon until explicitly stated in the show,  but there's no evidence against it at this point.

            I think if she was capable of proper flight she wouldn't need to climb hills and stand atop other ponies in order to gather Pegasi specific ingredients. Odds are her win muscles just aren't properly developed so she just hovers a bit. I mean we've seen other Pegasi her age and younger fly just fine.

            My personal fanon says she exercised the wrong wing muscles to help her boost her scooter,  rather than actually fly. It's gonna take her some physio but she can work her way skywards. Eventually.

            @Turtle: I think it's more along the lines feeling like a failure because you can't do something that just about everyone else of your race can do.  Practically,  I doubt it would be a problem; she still gets the passive magic that lets her interact with clouds and stuff,  she just can't fly.  And earth ponies manage just fine.  It's more the psychological factor of not being to do something that you should be able to do.  Not to mention that she utterly idolizes RD <em>because RD is an awesome flier</em>,  and knowing for a fact you can't live up to that has to hurt.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">That's basically how I see it.  She's capable of flight if she'd take the time to learn,  but she just never bothers because for the moment she doesn't really need to fly very often.
