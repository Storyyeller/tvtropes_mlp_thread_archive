            It's so confusing talking about multiple episodes at once. If only I could multitask mentally like Rin.

            @Yeller: Seeing as Old Dream Valley and Paradise Estate were constantly threatened by powerful enemies,  and Equestria itself seems to have its fair share of problems straight out of Gygaxian campaigns,  I always thought that ponies were at least pretty hardcore to carve themselves a tamed peaceful land out in the middle of who-knows-where.

            Last Roundup is one of my favorite episodes because it's right. It makes perfect sense for AJ to react how she did. And the others are right to worry about her like they did. She's not one to lie or go back on her promises,  so they knew something had to be up to prevent her from returning home like that. Cherry Jubilee is one of my favorite single episode characters,  Dodge Junction was interesting,  and there isn't really a single scene that I have a hard time remembering.<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> I have a feeling I talk about how much I like Last Roundup a lot.</div></span> <br> <br>e: You're asleep now.

            @J Teeth: To be honest I find it equally as interesting that people assume the exact opposite,  that ponies are naturally nicer,  kinder,  more altruistic etc. Personally we have seen them display a number of very human flaws,  so I really have no reason to assume that they are genuinely any better as a species on a moral/ethical level.

            Nah,  their world is kinda like ours,  only more advanced in some ways and less advanced in others. At least they don't have any "glass the land" tier weapons of mass destruction like we do. Also they seem not to have religious strife either.
<p></p>@Swas: Shipping goggles apparently say the episode is a flag for Dashie and AJ since Dashie was the first to know what's up.

            I'm not claiming that it's a straight sugar bowl,  or that there are no problems.  It's just that I've run into a lot of people (not necessarily around here) who just assume that Equestria is really just the same as earth but with ponies.  I.e. that it's plagued by stuff like xenophobia,  racism,  classism,  etc. because we've seen "soft" versions of those problems appear in the show.  To use a somewhat generic example,  I find it kinda weird that some people assume that there's a whole upper/lower class struggle comparable to ones that occur in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> even though at the absolute worst nothing like that appears in the show.  Take Blueblood for example.  He's basically spoiled rotten prince,  but a light and somewhat harmless version who's basically just a jerk.  But I've run into people who basically assume that in "reality" he's a classist who uses his status abuse the peasants and that we just don't see that because it's a kids show.  As opposed to just taking him at face value being a somewhat harmless jackass.
<p></p>EDIT: Basically what Meta Four said.  The issues in Equestria are evident enough that they're relateable,  but I think it's better than earth by a fair margin.

            @seraphem: Did I say that their world being nicer then our own was a bad thing? All that I was trying to point out is that I feel that we and ponies are not as different as some people say,  and that <em>some</em> of the difference can be connected to the kind of show that it is.
<p></p>If it came across as me saying that the setting of the show was somehow bad for any reason then that is not what I was trying to say. The setting itself is also a major draw of the show for me as well.
