            Hey guys. I think the episode was pretty great.
<p></p>The town <em>did</em> overreact,  but it's not like they have a history of overreacting to <em>every <strong>GODDAMN</strong> thing</em>,  like the Rabbit "Stampede",  or the Hazmat suits in Cutie Pox. Actually,  they were all in character here.
<p></p>Actually,  even Big Mac isn't really OOC,  as he didn't have much of a character to begin with (We didn't really saw him in situations he <em>shouldn't</em> have been nice and calm). Plus,  it probably stings in a family as close as the Apples to know your little sister made fun of everyone in the family...
<p></p>Also,  Celestia is just like us ! :D

            Something we never really saw was exactly how damaging the articles were to the ponies involved. Judging by what RD described in Cloudsdale,  it must have been pretty bad. Twilight could have been harassed by other ponies over her "snobbishness",  prompting her to isolate herself instead of erecting the barrier <em>solely</em> to keep the CMC out.

            How long a time period was this episode supposed to cover?  It seems odd that a paper would go from only circulating around the school all the way to Cloudsdale that quickly.  And for only one column.

            @Seraphem: Also a good point.  I still want to see DT hoist by her own petard,  though.

            Bitchin'. I liked it. Mac finally get a speaking role that doesn't make him seem brain-damaged,  we get further proof that Tiara is and always will be an utter bitch,  Snips and Snails make a return (I've always had a soft spot for Snails) and we see the Cake's kids again. Pinkie breaks down like an addict,  we learn things about Fluttershy that mmay or may not be true and they somehow manage to coax Dash into a spa.
<p></p>And you've never had coffee the way I make it: darker than Satan's heart,  sweeter than an angel and whiter than a cloud. And trust me,  self-ground is ages better than pre-ground.

            Not a fan of most fish,  but I'm surprised how good it tastse raw. It's a spicy cobo,  though. Hope it doesn't cause me any problems. The sauce they use sometimes gives me acid reflux.
