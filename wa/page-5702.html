            The mall may close at like 10-is but the cinema has it's own individual timetable. Basically the doors are open just for that. I'm convinced the mall's doors are never locked since I've been there to work as late as 3AM and as early as 7AM.
<p></p>And it's a combination of things. I go into the work break room,  sit to draw while I wait for my time to clock in and in comes lady-everyone-hates-her and she cusses mt out like no tomorrow,  and I nonchalantly ask if she was fired and she confirmed and continued to do so. I should've realized that was a bad sign but I effectively laughed it off.
<p></p>Then the actual work started. Imagine this,  imagine working cashier,  and instead of the usual "Huge RUSH break,  HUGE RUSH,  break" pattern,  it's a slow steady stream of people endlessly from 1:30 to 11:00,  and it doesn't stop,  the people just keep coming but not in a huge rush but in an endless steady stream,  you help 2 and 1 more takes their place. No opportunity to take a break,  no window to use the restroom,  just wall to wall idiots as far as the eye can see.... Idiots... Idiots everywhere....
<p></p>Somewhere early on I fell. I slipped o a floor of melted ice because the naive girl can't keep her section clean,  I landed on my back,  and my aching neck was bothering me all night.
<p></p>And near the end,  there were three consecutive soda spills because the idiot customers can't hold their goddamn cups correctly,  having to clean the spills at my station so frikkin' often.......
<p></p>I was somewhere in the middle of all this I was able to have my break,  that's when I watched he episode,  a brief saving grace before back to the agony booth.

<p></p>I have a headache....
<p></p>And what do I have for solace? That Rarity is still a b****y hypocrite so I am continually validated.

            Yeah,  Rarity seemed a lot less mature than in previous episodes.

            Ouch,  Mousa. Sounds like a rough day. My meager disappointment doesn't seem so bad in comparison now...
<p></p>I really need to try to treat the people in my theater nicer. I mean I don't treat them poorly,  but still... I probably come across as aloof at best. No service sector job is easy,  I imagine a friendly,  polite customer might be nice every now and then.

            It just looked to me like Rarity pulled her usual act of realizing her own hypocrisy and growing from the experience. Problem is that she wasn't the focus character,  so it just comes off as her being a jerk if you aren't watching for it. Still,  that quality about her is what makes her my favorite out of the cast (though only by a small margin).

            Ouch Mousa.  I've worked retail,  customer service,  and know exactly the type of activity you mean.  Hopefully your neck feels better after some sleep.  Don't beat yourself up about not asking the girl you like out,  another better opportunity will come.  At least the day's over and you can get to doing something fun.

            It's actually randomized to bring you to a different version of the homepage each time you go to it. Unfortunately it appears to be set up using the normal wiki technology,  so you can't simply refresh to get a new page. You have to click on the home page link or enter the URL manually to trigger the script.

            It's probably just a random redirect. Once you've been redirected it won't trigger again.
