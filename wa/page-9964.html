<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Funny thing is I always imagined Twilight as someone having a younger brother for whatever reason...
<p></p>Yes its a rumor,   but I guess we can have some fun with speculation.
<p></p>We don't know anything about Shining Armor beyond that he's getting married to royalty and he is more than likely named for Knight in Shining Armor. Is he in the Equestrian military? Is Twilight's family in fact nobility (or otherwise "very important ponies"),   and thus why they were able to get Twilight in the door at an (presumably) extremely prestigious magic school in the first place?
<p></p>If he is her brother...would of been nice if he cameo'd in "Cutie Mark Chronicles" (though its doubtful they were planning this far ahead). Still,   this might mean we'll see Twilight's parents again and find out exactly who they are beyond being G1 pony expies.

            I'm really surprised they're releasing so many spoilers this early. IIRC,  for season 2 they only released two short clips and that was only a week before the premiere.

            To recap,  here's everything that's been said by the leaked toy line so far:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Crystal Empire</span>: "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Welcome to the Crystal Empire,  a magical place full of hidden secrets!

<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Crystal Fashion Style Princess Cadance &amp; Shining Armor</span>: Description unknown.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Crystal Princess Ponies Collection</span>: "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Princess Celestia and Princess Luna believe that Princess Cadance will bring happiness to the Crystal Empire!</span>"
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Glimmer Wings Diamond Rose &amp; Pinkie Pie</span>: "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pinkie Pie loves when her hair sparkles like crystals!

</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Glimmer Wings Sweet Song &amp; Fluttershy</span>: "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fluttershy can't believe how pretty her hair looks with shiny strands!

</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pony Rainbow Collection</span>: No individual description (other than "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Boy pony!</span>" for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Emerald Ray</span>).
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p>Keep in mind that these aren't all necessarily related to the show,  seeing as some of the Pony Wedding toys weren't represented in either part of "A Canterlot Wedding"â€”they never mowed down changelings with the Twilight Sparkle RC Car,  Fluttershy was never shown with Glimmer Wings,  and we didn't see Daisy Dreams (with or without Glimmer Wings),  Trixie Lulamoon,  or Sunny Rays at all.

            @Sereg: I doubt it; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Glimmer Wings toys have generally been pretty disconnected from the show,  and unlike the Crystal Ponies,  they have gotten a bit of in-show representation already (Rarity in "Sonic Rainboom",  before the Glimmer Wings toys were even made)</span>.
<p></p>I could kinda see <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Emerald Ray showing up as a background pony...maybe Berry Green and/or Electric Sky too,  since they're the other two ponies who've been Crystal Ponies but haven't appeared in the show yet</span> (EDIT: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though the first toys of those two have already been released</span>).

<p></p>And there are also a bunch of leaked brushables with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">blocky-edged eye highlights reminiscent of crystal shapes</span>...not too sure what to make of those...

            @Death Cloud: No,  the Twinkle-Eyed ponies were a toyline group from G1 that included all three pony races,  not just unicorns.  There were many other unicorns released in G1 that were not part of the Twinkle-Eyed set.  The reason for their eyes being different was never stated in the animated show,  but one of the UK comics had a story about their eyes being like that because they got replaced by gems because the Twinkle-Eyed ponies had gone blind from being forced to work and live underground.

<p></p>That Crystal Empire thing sounds pretty interesting!  I wonder if this is a separate town or country from Equestria that is out of Celestia and Luna's ruling.  Because if that's true,  then it would mean that Cadance would be heir to an entire country of ponies.  If the country was lost and left without a regular ruler,  that could explain why Cadance was living more like a regular pony in Canterlot and being Twilight's foalsitter rather than being groomed to be the future ruler of the Crystal Empire.
<p></p>If Cadance does retake her place as the ruler of the Crystal Empire,  does that mean that Shining Armor would help rule beside her?  I wonder what that would mean for Twilight's status as well.  Also,  since the main conflict of the story had started in the finale by the time that Twilight knew that her brother was marrying her old foal-sitter,  we haven't gotten to see Rarity's reaction to the fact that Twilight had a princess as a babysitter when she was younger!
