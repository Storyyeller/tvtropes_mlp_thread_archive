            @Badwolf,  Fluttershy is the reason Pinkie took "extreme measures" in Gilda's episode.

            I'm actually a little surprised Rarity and Pinkie were getting along so well this episode.  It wasn't that long ago they were stuck in the desert together and Rarity wanted to bludgeon Pinkie.

            Thirty plus pages since I went to sleep? Nope,  not reading. Most of this has probably been said,  but eh. <br> <br>Just going from the preview,  I still find Iron Will annoying,  but hopefully he’s not actually that bad. Angel is always hilarious. I’m really picky,  so I can totally understand him. And of course the stream chat is demonizing him for being mean to Fluttershy. Of course. <br> <br>Fluttershy,  you can’t walk away from a line and expect to keep your place. That isn’t how it works. Rarity knows just how to be the best. And of course Pinkie knows how to haggle. Fluttershy is <em>clearly</em> superior at it,  though. <br> <br>I don’t think pamphlets usually have pop-outs like that. <br>Wait,  “hedge maze center”? How is that a thing? I get that it’s a joke at the whole minotaur thing,  but still. Wouldn’t you have to go through the maze every time you wanted to get to it? That seems really unnecessary and silly. And if it wasn’t really much of a maze,  it ruins the point of it being a maze in the first place. <span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> stop overthinking things like this,  it’s silly.</div></span> <br> <br>Okay,  those goats are just really freaky. was that really just an “I pity the fool”? Did they really just do that? Fluttershy’s smile is still unnerving at the end of that scene for some reason. <br> <br>Bon Bon. Your voice. It needs to stop being hilarious. Rarity,  what are you doing behind the counter at Sugarcube Corner? You don’t work there. <br> <br>I am really not a fan of assertive Fluttershy. At all. I understand they’re overplaying her assertiveness to prove a point,  but it was just getting obnoxious. Uh,  Fluttershy. A minotaur IS a monster. :l <br> <br>And of course Angel would be perfectly willing to tie her up <span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> don’t you dare take this the wrong way or I will internet punch you</div></span>) Ohgod,  Pinkie. Your neck. I don’t think it should stretch like that.  <br> <br>Fluttershy’s “no” was adorable. At least they didn’t make Iron Will angry about the money.  I think that was one thing I was really hoping they wouldn’t do.  <br> <br>I wasn’t really liking the episode that much,  but the latter half after she realized how rude she was being made up for it. Wasn’t that great overall,  somewhere around the middle,  but still good. <br> <br><div class="quoteblock"> Also,  when Iron Will broke the 4th wall</div>
Wait when did this happen?
