            Well,  I think we've just about finished our <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WMGs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WMGs">WM Gs</a> for Cadence's dark secret.... So what do you guys think about Alicorns? Are they true immortal god-like beings,  ponies that are simply longer-lived and more powerful? Are they born by normal means,  ascended from normal ponies,  or are they part of creation? Or something else? I love these alicorn theories. They're fun ^^
<p></p>I'm hoping Cadence's life will reveal a little about them

            Immortal and Godlike. Spawned from the harmony flame from Hearths Warming Eve when ponykind is irrevocably threatened. Cadence was born of an Alicorn and a regular pony so she has half the power and only lives as long as a dragon.

            I believe that Alicorns are born by normal means rather than ascending from a "lower" state of ponyhood or merging from three exemplars of each of the races.  I find the gestalt theory a little saddening to be honest.  As for them being actual physical gods?  I can't say,  there simply isn't enough evidence. Although they are doubtlessly powerful beyond the norm of the other types of pony and incredibly long-lived,  so they might as well be.

            My theory is that Alicorns are born when their genetic makeup is a perfect equilabrium of all 3 races. Which is really rare.

            Sigh,  now I'm just waiting for Kegi to come barging in...
<p></p>And in my eyes Alicorns are just another species. Incredibly powerful but not gods by any stretch of the imagination. And I don't consider them born from the primordial ether or anything confusing like that... Celestia and Luna are around because a mommy alicorn and a daddy alicorn decided to try out this new fangled "sex" thing... at least twice

            Yeah,  I'm torn between Alicorns being created with the Elements of Harmony (or a similar force) and them just being born like regular ponies. With the appearance of Cadence though,  it's starting to look like Luna and Celestia are not complete goddesses. They might as well be gods with their power,  but they're not truly immortal,  just more powerful

            Celestia and Luna are powerful enough that distinguishing between "might as well be gods" and "gods" is a moot point. For all intents and purposes they are divine entities,  and the ponies treat them that way,  regardless of whether they actually are or not. As for Alicorns as a whole,  we'll just have to wait and see what Cadence brings to the table here. Two is not a very good sample size.

            @ginger: What,  my 'old soul' theory? Well,  under that alicorns as a race don't really exist. The old souls just take on elements of the races that they rule over - Prince Tidus,  for example,  rules over unicorns and hippocampi and is thus a horned sea pony. Old souls ruling over a single race just appear to be a larger version of them. This is really only for convenience sake; the old souls can mostly choose how they look through magic(They do have 'true' forms for the most part,  but they rarely assume them). All the old souls agreed to do it at the advent of the countries,  so no one race would feel favored.
<p></p>Ahem. More to the point,  it's not like it's any more developed as a theory. Quite frankly,  it's significantly less likely than any other reason posited. It's basically just my insane ramblings,  there's no reason to feel threatened by it.
<p></p>Also,  Drenius,  how does any theory on alicorns apply to the gestalt theory? Isn't the gestalt theory just that the mind registers something in it's entirety,  then organizes it into categories before relaying it to the conscious?

            Sorry,  I may have misused gestalt in my case  I was referring to the theory that an alicorn is in fact a composite being formed of an most shining example of what a pony could be  from each race.  I have in the past,  heard gestalt used in order to describe a composite consciousness or entity.
