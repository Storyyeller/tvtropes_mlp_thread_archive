<p></p>@Fallen Legend: Pretty much. I hate shows that refer to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> as 'taking away flaws and turning character into blank slate'. Flaws need to be balanced but they are what largely make a character unique,  and usually a lot of what make them fun.

            WALL OF TEXT INBOUND <br>Okay,  so I had this all typed out after the episode,  but I went out with my friends to see a movie and stuff and couldn’t post until now. I hope you’re not tired of talking about the episode yet.<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> Also,  30 pages while I was gone. So many.</div></span> <br> <br>Pre-thoughts before watching: Yes,  this is going to be great. <br> <br>…okay,  this is a dream. Good. Spike. Stop fawning over Rarity. Writers. Stop making him fawn over Rarity so much. This is exactly what I was describing a while ago. They overplay the attraction too much. This wasn’t that bad because it was just a quick gag,  but it’s still bothersome. <br> <br>Okay,  I normally find OCD Twilight slightly out there,  but this scheduling is just so ridiculous,  it’s funny. So much scheduling. Backup plan is reading two books at once. I believe in you,  Twilight,  you can do it. <br> <br>YOU ARE NOT SCIENTIFICALLY POSSIBLE is still one of the best lines from the series to me. And we have usual stumbling over tenses during speech. Good. <br> <br>Pinkie. You can’t run through the air. Stop it. <br>Oh wait,  you can. Yeah,  let’s just go with that. <br> <br>As someone who liked MMDW,  I am really happy to see that dam again. It does seem to break and crack a lot,  though. You’d think they would fix it by now. Get on that,  construction ponies. <br> <br>Pinkie’s tiny hair being out of line is obviously the worst disaster that could happen. Okay,  what? Las Pegasus seems like a little bit of a stretch. Baltimare’s pretty neat though. I can’t say I ever really feel the city puns,  but they’re at least having fun with them. <br> <br>Hi there Cerberus. Holy crap,  what? I just... that’s a nice surprise. Only Fluttershy would be able to walk up to Cerberus and not have any trouble.  <br> <br>Oh,  no! Not ball emergencies! <br> <br>Okay,  I’m still not getting over Tartarus being a thing that exists. <br> <br>I love pacing a lot. Twilight,  you are awesome for pacing a lot. Not moving until Tuesday? You can do this,  I believe in you again! <br> <br>And now it’s time for me to complain. Spike is being an ass here. A lot. Sure,  he’s just teasing her about how ridiculous she’s being,  but come on. It's a bit much. <br> <br>So,  how many “jobs” does Pinkie have around Ponyville? I’d like to imagine she just goes around and pretends to be random occupations in her free time. Mostly because that’s silly and seems like something she would do. <br> <br>Twilight! You are performing science! And Pinkie has no idea what an aperture to a catadioptric telescope is. I like how she just kind of stared blankly at the sky instead of looking at the telescope at all. Pinkie has the best emergency preparations for the best situations. <br> <br>Oh boy! More trains! How many times has it shown up now? Yes Pinkie,  MGS is very fun. It’s nice that you agree. <br> <br>Oh hey there Celestia,  nice to see you. I know this was said a lot,  but why exactly was she in the Star Swirl wing? <span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> Most people are going to say Trollestia,  aren’t they? :l</div></span> <br> <br>Time Loops for everyone. I actually don’t see what was so wrong about reusing the same scene near the end. I thought it was a nice touch to really point out nothing changed. If they had changed it,  it would have seemed like Twilight managed to change something. <br>PTS is so much more annoying than FTS <br>\
Resident Spike talk: Yeah,  he got better later on,  but the dream sequence and the intentional bothering in the library were really annoying. <br> <br>I really liked the episode. I’d place it somewhere near the top of season 2,  but not too high. <br> <br>and it looks like we're talking about something else now. Oh well,  I should learn to post faster next time. That sucks,  Light. Sorry.

            @Light: Don't feel bad,  this type of behaviour is sadly common in this world. We can't all have our smoopy-doopy sweetie-weetie pony-pie.
<p></p>Something tells me your girlfriend won't either if her fiance knows about her behavior.
<p></p>For some reason I like the Rarity*Spike interaction,  though I'm interested to see how it can go now that she seemingly knows about it.
