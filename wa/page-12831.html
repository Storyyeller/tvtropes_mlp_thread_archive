            Okay,  if Babs had shown up in an unrelated episode for no reason they might have something,  but given the episode it would have been weird if she hadn't shown up.  Why are people so quick to look for reasons the show is going downhill?

            While it would have been nice to have heard Braeburn have some lines,  I think Babs having a more prominent role than him in this episode boils down to Cindy Morrow being a little more familiar with her,  which I'm fine with.

            Sounds good,  Morning Star.
<p></p>I had a thought. Babs changed schools. Which would probably only happen if her parents (or legal guardian or whoever) knew about her being bullied. Which means that she probably <em>did</em> talk to her sister when she got back to Manehattan. Which makes me really happy,  for some reason.

            Giving Babs screentime over Braeburn makes sense.  If he had gotten lines,  it would probably have been with Applejack,  but the whole point of the episode was that she was paying more attention to the activities she set up than to her family.
<p></p>I guess he could have gotten some time with Big Macintosh,  but those conversations would have been pretty one sided.  Not that I would mind seeing them.

            I have to agree pretty much with storyyeller on the new episode. It's not bad,  but it doesn't really go anywhere until the final minute,  and it feels like the dilemma should have elevated a bit more than AJ just mildly boring and annoying the other Apples (I could argue this may have been due to the lengthy song truncating things,  though I'm not big on songs so maybe I'm biased).
<p></p>At least we got an AJ episode,  but at the same time I wonder if that's what brought the episode down. It just feels like one of those plots that would have used much more potential with Twilight or Pinkie.

            @Psi: Yeah,  I can see that.  It wasn't <em>bad</em> per se,  but there was a lot more that could have been done with it.  That said,  I think it made sense that AJ was more reserved about her insanity.  It would have been weird to have her go zany.  It would have worked a bit better if it had focused more on her personal interactions with Granny and Apple Bloom or something.  Also,  the episode needed more Big Macintosh.

            Maybe they were in the process of transferring her or something.  Like they decided to change her school,  and sent her to Ponyville for a week in between to give her some time to relax.

            They <em>did</em> pass up a chance for Braeburn to go "Braeburn has arrived in POOOOOOOOOOONYVILLE!!... Huh,  don't have the same ring to it..."
<p></p>Again,  it was probably just Cindy is more familiar with the character she wrote herself last time (she didn't write "Over a Barrel"),  and lets be honest,  more Babs means more focus for <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter">Apple Bloom</a>.

As said,  it might have worked if they had the plot elevate more before the climax with the barn.

<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_%28disambiguation%29">"Moon" is just another term for month or the Lunar cycle, <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> so it's not something they've made up for the show. The real question is how different the Lunar Cycle is in Equestria,  since Luna can probably control it at will. If it were,  say,  a week,  then "100 moons" would be about two years,  which almost matches up with the reunion in Episode 1.
