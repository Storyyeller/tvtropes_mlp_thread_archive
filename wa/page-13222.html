            This episode was awful,  simply awful. And the worst part is that I knew it was going to be awful. THIS was the great episode of the season? My god it was booooooring! I laughed at like two jokes,  no scratch that,  I laughed at ONE joke. Discord telling Fluttershy her stare was useless,  thats it. The only funny thing in the episode.
Yeah I´m happy they didn´t "ruin" the character but still it was simply awful! The most boring episode of the entire show!

            Well that was... actually pretty good! It's nice to see he didn't pull a complete 180,  actually. Hell,  by most accounts you could say he's the same as he ever was,  but with a different,  more effective leash... which is a pretty good way to handle it,  I think. Props to this episode! Now lets see everyone who hates it.

            Yeah,  he's never leaving the "chaotic" part of the alignment table.  Also,  now I'm really wondering what the show is gonna do with him now.  They had <em>better</em> bring him back at some point.

            I suppose the idea of a god-like evil threat being released after 1000 years being easily forgivable isn't a far stretch for this show.  We were able to forgive Princess Luna after that many years too.

            Apart from it really needing to be longer,  this episode was a <em>very</em> funny one. Discord did get reformed,  and I bet not everyone will like that,  but did we expect anything else? It's not like Discord was fully evil,  so much as does things for shits and giggles anyway,  so realising that friendship can be fun too does make sense. It's not like he didn't outright say he isn't done with evil,  anyway.

            @Kegisak: Indeed.  I think they flipped him a bit quick,  but it's nice to see that the cast's fears were at least somewhat warranted and that they were smart enough to have a plan rather than just letting him run wild.
<p></p>As for the fact that he's reformed,  I think Cookoo hit the nail on the head.  Discord is more about enjoying himself more than anything else.  It's just now he finally realizes that enjoying himself and always getting his own way aren't necessarily the same thing.

Five bits says "Discord vs. Sombra season finale showdown".
<p></p>Okay,  not really. But that would have been fun.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Soooo... that's just how it ends? What happens to Discord now? Does he LIVE with them?? Does he travel? Does every other pony accept him now? That was a pretty abrupt ending!</div>
My baseless speculation is that he has a pocket dimension to call home.
