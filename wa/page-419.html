            Also,  actually CHASING Rainbow Dash was a bad idea on Pinkie's part. Using <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation">Offscreen Teleportation</a> she was able to get to wherever Rainbow Dash was flying BEFORE her. If she'd just continued to do that,  then she would've been able to warp into the barn when Rainbow Dash ran in there. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

<p></p>I have a theory about that (actually commented about it on a Youtube video).  See,  this show actually takes place in a dystopian society where,  among other things,  the concept of friendship has long been forgotten; any hint of friendship or kindness is superficial at best,  just like Rainbow Dash's friendship with Gilda.  That's why Twilight's letters are important - because the world actually has to completely <em>relearn</em> these concepts.

            Pinkie knows pretty much everypony in Ponyville,  and she's at least on conversational terms with most of them,  I'd imagine - some of them no doubt see her as the town eccentric,  but they all know her.  It's also likely that some of the mane cast knew each other before Twilight came to town and looped them into a coherent group; I don't think any of them introduce themselves in the pilot except to Twilight,  for instance,  though I might be wrong.

            I am gonna be a horrible person and say that things like friends or relatives (even parents) turn up when there is a reason for it. Its cast economy,  people. Gilda as an old friend of Rainbow Dash (yeah,  I also think that was a genuine friendship) makes sense because that's what the episode is about. While there are some people who might have been loners (it would make sense for Twilight,  since the whole point with the show is that she is on a sacred quest to stop being asocial) or have say parents who are dead (it seems shady that Applejack is in charge of a farm that holds her grandma and siblings but not her parents - farmers tend to stay on their farms) I assume they have friends and family,  and they will turn up when the writer need one.

            ^^I think they were really friends,  yeah,  when they were ten; Dash just happened to change and grow up,  while Gilda... really didn't,  in the end.  Gilda couldn't really accept that Dash had changed,  which isn't the healthiest type of friendship.  Like I've said before,  if Gilda comes back in the second season having learned her lesson (about harassing random bypassers,  as well),  I'd welcome her back.
<p></p>^Naturally,  the characters who appear will fit into cast economy,  but we're discussing in an in-universe sense.

            Rainbow Dash didn't change as far as I can tell.  Gilda was just selfish and wanted Dash all to herself,  or at least,  didn't want to share her,  or accept that Dash had other pony friends.
<p></p>Also,  presumably Fluttershy and Dash were close enough for Dash to be upset enough to defend Fluttershy's honor,  though some of that was also being insulted herself.
<p></p>But yeah,  it's a matter of things existing as the plot demands.

            We don't know what Dash was really like as filly (we saw what,  a minute or two?),  so we can't really say if she changed or not. But Dash never saw a lot of the worst things that Gilda did. But Dash likes her pranks,  so its not hard to imagine her going a bit too far when she was younger too. A grown woman scaring an old lady is cruel,  but a kid scaring an old lady is just...well,  not <em>good</em>,  but forgivable.

            Thing is,  I can forgive Gilda for scaring Granny Smith,  as it was just a harmless prank. Stealing and roaring at Fluttershy less so,  but Gilda doesn't seem inherantly bad,  just a griffon who's never been taken down a peg once in her life. Humble pie is exactly what the doctor ordered,  and I reckon that if she wasn't in front of all those ponies when RD stood up to her,  then she might've repented (she was embaressed and got really hurt by RD's betrayal,  plus,  look at the way she stammers before calling RD a flip flop,  she clearly didn't want to say anything TOO mean)

            ^Yeah,  that's true.  I don't have anything concrete to base my claim that Dash grew up on - just a feeling that filly Dash wouldn't really have been opposed to the snake prank,  but Dash today would have a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">Dude, Not Funny!</a> reaction. It's pretty weak,  I admit,  but I don't like thinking of Gilda as maliciously selfish rather than (admittedly severely) misguided.

            The reason I say Dash and Gilda's friendship was superficial is simply that Dash wasn't <em>aware</em> of Gilda's personality issues,  which was at least in part because she was actively hiding them (by,  for instance,  sending Dash off somewhere before wrecking Pinkie's flying machine).  It's the level of misdirection involved in the core of the relationship that makes me question it.

            Maybe it's because Gilda is easily the most reviled character in the series with little reason? Okay,  there are reasons,  sure,  but for a group of people who tout 'love and tolerance' we're waaaaaay to hard on her as a fandom.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">That may actually be a sign of Gilda's fondness for Dash. It was obvious that Dash liked Pinkie a fair bit in that episode. Gilda's intentions were by no means pure,  she wanted to keep dash from getting mad at her,  not spare dash's feeling on the matter.
<p></p>Most,  if not all of the 'villains' we've seen aren't bad,  by any stretch of the imagination. They just suffer from character flaws. Pride,  in fact,  seems to be the common factor. Blueblood was proud of his heritage,  and so believed himself superior to the 'common' Rarity,  as well as proud of his appearance. Trixie was proud of her skill as a magician,  and reacted poorly to those who questioned it. Gilda was proud of her 'strength',  and lorded it over those who were weaker than herself,  as well as becoming angry when that image of strength was tarnished (Via pranking).

            I just hope that Gilda and RD make up. If for no other reason than just because RD represents Loyalty,  and I don't think she'd give up hope on ANY of her friends old or new.
