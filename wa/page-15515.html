            I liked EQG,  too.
<p></p>In other news,  I just watched <em>Snowdrop</em> for the first time. Because the latest <em>Friendship Is Witchcraft</em> episode had a parody of it,  and I wanted the context to get it. Way to go,  Sherclop: by making fun of it,  you convinced me to watch it.

            I'm pretty sure I'd like Equestria Girls too. When it got leaked onto Youtube last week I watched a good bit of it and liked it,  but I haven't seen the whole thing though apparently it'll be on the Hub on Labor Day weekend.

            The plot wasn't fantastic,  but the execution wasn't half bad and as indicated on the EG thread,  I'd quite like a sequel film or miniseries to explore it more. They bring up so much and leave it by the wayside for the fairly flat plot.
<p></p>And awesome another Stirling fan,  her stuff's fantastic.

            <span class="blue"> @Sereg: He wasn't overly irritating or anything,  but he was completely unnecessary.  Every one of his scenes could have been removed with no impact on the plot (other than him clearing Twi's name with Luna,  but any of her friends could have done that).  Even the little romance tease with him and Twi went nowhere.</span>

            At any rate,  I liked the callback to Fluttershy's meeting with Twi.
<p></p>And I think they should have given Flash's scenes to Dash,  if only for something for her to do. I heard maybe half a page of dialogue from her in the film.

            @Blue about Flash. That seems fair. I couldn't really think of anything he did besides the picture thing anyway. <br> <br>And for the climax... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">I was expecting so much more from the vague descriptions I got before seeing it. It was just kind of disappointing when her demon form or whatever ended up just being pretty lame. Design-wise and what she does. Demon pony would probably look cooler.</span> Seeing more of what Sunset could do as a pony would definitely have been nice. I think I just felt like most of the time,  there was more about Snips and Snails than her.
