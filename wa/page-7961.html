            Silver Spoon has had all of <em>one</em> character moment in the entire series outside of being DT's groupie. Kind of hard to judge her character in any real capacity.

            @Lurker but even when she's acting as DT's groupie,  she seems to have more kindness in her than DT does. She actually seemed concerned for her friend in Call of the Cutie and tried to cheer her up.
<p></p>I actually liked that,  I was expecting her to abandon DT

            Silver Spoon struck me as that sort of character who's not bad,  but hangs out with a bad person just because their her only friend. She plays along with the bad,  but left on her own she'd be neutral.

            I think sympathetic villains work as long as they don't make them so sympathetic the heroes look a bit tough on them. I think that's the reason for Boast Buster's complaints (even if Trixie is a jerkass,  she's petty and very ineffectual at the end).
<p></p>That's why I think a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinionWithAnFInEvil" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinionWithAnFInEvil">Minion with an F in Evil</a> would be interesting to play out in the series,  since it would likely require the heroes to envoke some sympathetic (or at least merciful) traits.
