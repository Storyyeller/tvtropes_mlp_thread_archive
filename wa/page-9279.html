            Syd: It goes pretty well.  I woke up in the night because my room had gotten too cold,  so I had to turn the A/C up,  but other than that,  I had a nice evening.  I went out for Thai with my brother and afterwards we went to see Prometheus since he hadn't seen it yet.

            When I hear <em>Prometheus</em>,  I think of an old two-part episode of the live-action <em>Incredible Hulk</em> TV series,  where Banner is stuck mid-transformation and is captured by military personnel,  who mistakenly think he's an alien.

            @ Drenius:  I own the complete show on DVD.  I love the way producer Kenneth Johnson chose to put the main focus on Banner and his lonely search for a cure,  rather than treat the show as another "superhero" series.

            I agree Syd,  if the focus had been on Banner's alter ego,  it would not have been nearly as compelling as it was.  Besides,  it gave us "The Lonely Man" theme.  I don't think I realised it had gotten a DVD release.  I ought to pick it up.

            @Syd Maybe it was a budgetary thing. They didn't have the money to produce enough convincing effects to involve a lot of supervillains and high-octane fight scenes,  so they decided to shift the focus to something they could do really well on a small budget

            According to Kenneth Johnson,  when he approached Bill Bixby to star in the series,  Bixby said,  "Come on,  Kenny.  I don't want to star in something called <em>The Incredible Hulk</em>!"  Johnson told Bixby to just read the script for the pilot,  then call him back.  Bixby called the next day,  all excited.

            I don't like the three reunion movies that were made from 1988-1990.  They were made without Johnson's involvement,  and the Hulk <em>was</em> treated like a superhero.  In fact,  the first two featured substandard versions of Thor and Daredevil,  in that order.
<p></p>Worse,  Banner's main antagonist,  relentless tabloid reporter Jack <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGee" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGee">Mc Gee</a> (who believes the Hulk murdered Banner and another scientist),  is nowhere to be seen the the final two movies.

            If I were too guess,  I'd assume that the reporter is following the Hulk's trail of destruction from town to town,  and if he catches up he could find out that Banner IS the Hulk

            I find it funny how <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word Of God</a> is applied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaurenFaust" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaurenFaust">Lauren Faust</a> is the creator of the show,  but it turns out that her word is not as authoritative as we might think. Sure,  she gave a lot of explanations,  but she herself explicitly said that her explanations should not be taken as canon. Then you have the fact that she started out as the creator in Season 1,  then moved to a consulting capacity in Season 2,  and she will be completely uninvolved in Season 3. To me,  that just hammers it in that she may have been the creator,  but that doesn't make her word any more powerful than the next person's.
<p></p>I know she said that Nightmare Moon and Luna are separate entities,  but she did admit that it raises a whole bunch of questions and she didn't get that far. To me,  it makes more sense if NMM and Luna were one and the same. If they were the same,  then it would help explain why she felt the need to earn love in "Luna Eclipsed" and why everypony kept acting like Luna is NMM,  That,  and it would have more of an emotional impact that way! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">

<p></p>By reporting his (wrong) interpretation of the events at the end of the pilot to the authorities,  thus making the Hulk wanted by the law.  He doesn't know that Banner is alive; he thinks Banner was killed by the Hulk.  Also,  it seems like every time Banner Hulks-out,  <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGee" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGee">Mc Gee</a> arrives in town to investigate,  and Banner has to get out of town to avoid detection.
<p></p>The pilot movie (from 1977) sets up the premise very well,  IMO.
