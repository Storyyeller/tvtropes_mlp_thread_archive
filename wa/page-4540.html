            @ JT,  it's called haggling,  given the level Equestrian economy seems to be at,  seems like it should be a standard practice
<p></p>@ Ginger Most of the "jerks" only acted that way because they knew she wouldn't stand up for herself at all. Should be easy to handle.

            Yeah,  that cherry guy was a colossal ass.
<p></p>When they first mentioned that hedge maze I thought Fluttershy was going all the way to Canterlot for this seminar,  but I guess they just have hedge mazes everywhere in Equestria.

            @Chariot: I'm pretty sure we weren't supposed to agree with his lessons,  so that's not really a problem.  And at the very least he realized that "being assertive" =/= "being a jerk".  He didn't really change,  but neither did Trixie,  Gilda,  or Blueblood.  Not everyone is going to learn a lesson.
<p></p>@Seraphem: Yeah,  but the cherry thing is just egregious; I mean,  he doubled the price when he heard how badly Fluttershy wanted it.  There's trying to get a good price,  and there's hiking it up to get extra money.

            Ponyville <em>does</em> have its share of jerks in other episodes,  though. I mean,  look at Bon Bon in "Green Isn't Your Color". We just saw a higher concentration of them,  because the episode focused on Fluttershy,  who seems to brings that out in people.

            @ Crowfall: Maybe that is the goat racial talent. Easy transport of plants.
<p></p>Yeah I think the goats just speak another language. Like Zecora did with the potion.

            @Seraphem: I guess I'll have to rewatch the scene.  It struck me more of a "I had to raise the general price for everyone today" that Pinkie Pie was trying to get around.  Like going to a gas station and refusing to pay the current gas price because last week's were lower.  I could be off though.

            So is will a oneshot or antagonist? I say the former,  since it was fluttershy's fault really. Plus,  we dont know exactly how will taught the seminar since it was offscreen.

            Yeah,  Angel needed a smack.
<p></p>@Duck: Of course,  don't you remember the Gala incident? My guess is that Fluttershy may actually act like such a doormat,  <em>because</em> of her anger problems. She knows about them,  and doesn't want things to get out of hand.
