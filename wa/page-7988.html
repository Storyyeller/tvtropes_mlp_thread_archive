<p></p>this one he was told he could make the movie his way at first,  then they changed it mid production.

            I'm imagining that scene when Celestia finnaly god pissed,  banish Goldbloon into Moon. Goes back to Canterlot. Takes control  of Equestia again (with Luna approval),  both teleport to Zebra Ceasar and confince that moron (no matter if with paragon or regenerate arguments) to end war.

            @ lurker you really sould,  your already over half way done,  and most of the stuff has perfectly reasonable explanations,  smart,  not necessarily,  but since when has every single decison some country at war has made everbeen smart?, , or hell every decision made period.
<p></p>That's what I loved about the back story in FOE it felt real,  it dind't feel like a story,  it felt like a history book,  nearly everything they did I could understand how it seemed like a good idea at the time,  even if you could see in hindsight why it was a horrible idea,  plus for a good part of it there's the fact that it's second-third-tenth hoof accounts and hearsay colored by perception.

            <em>It's about time! Next time,  don't make it 18 player.</em>
<p></p>I don't think there will be a next time.  The game fell victim to a glitch that led to anyone who wanted to play being greeted with a "Another person is playing.  Check back in 10 minutes" message. This went on for at least three weeks,  so I'm told.
<p></p>Thanks to all who played.
