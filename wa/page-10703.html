            Discord at least kind of has an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">In the Blood</a> excuse and is a bit more versatile in his ass-ery. He just likes causing goofy stuff to happen,  it just wavers whether that comes down to being a jerk someone. He's the definition of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">It Amused Me</a> (outside the Joker of course).
<p></p>A lot of villains in the show just seem to be driven to be nasty or hateful to someone without much explanation to it. Yeah bullies like that do exist,  but surely there's some villains without completely petty motivations.

            I have to say I really don't mind the "douchebag" antagonists as long as they're interesting. I mean,  the show as a whole is a lot more about everyday social conflicts rather than big epic "villain threatens the world" conflicts.  There's nothing wrong with having an antogonist who's merely a jackass as long as they're an entertaining jackass and have motivation beyond <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>.  I.e. Trixie worked because she actually had a reason to be a jerk (she wanted to puff herself up).

            Chrysalis had some motivation,  but her sadism and one dimentional evulz towards the whole thing took out any chance of it becoming a complexity.

            Yeah,  Chrysalis had motivation to be evil,  but she was obviously enjoying herself.  A more conflicted villain would certainly be interesting.

You have to be careful not to make the heroes look bad,  but I think it's entirely possible.

            After hearing so many people on this very website talk about how the villains are "always" more interesting than the heroes,  it's amusing to see how exactly the opposite is true of this show.

            I've actually been more or less ok with the set of antagonist we have had so far. I don't really see them going for a genuinely sympathetic villain in this show. I imagine even if they had a sympathetic motive they would still be clearly "evil".

            I'd really like to see an episode where the CMC have to interact with Silver Spoon and realize that if not for the fact that she hangs out with DT all the time,  she'd actually be pretty cool.  Sort of force them to realize "holy crap she isn't as much of a bitch as we thought" and have them deal with it.  Maybe split the CMC down the middle for once.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I don't think being sympathetic and being definitively evil are necessarily mutually exclusive.  For example,  I think they could have pulled it off with Gilda if they had developed her more.  Explained that she was really jealous of Pinkie's friendship with RD and such,  but at the same time her behavior still makes her definitively jerky.

            I can sort of understand why they may want to avoid making villains too sympathetic,  since they tend to dangerous in rather saccharine shows and deract entertainment value and sympathy for being more flawed and normal characters than the cutesy ones (eg. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyTown" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyTown">LazyTown</a>,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareBears" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareBears">Care Bears</a>,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreamstone" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreamstone">The Dreamstone</a>). FIM may be able to avoid this more due to the ponies complex heavily flawed personalities however. Hell a more developed version of Dragonshy where they take pity on an antagonist may even work.

            Flim and Flam had more of a motivation than being asses.  They wanted money.  Which really is a pretty realistic reason for being an ass.

            But in order to build up the villian they need to focus more time on them,  and the single biggest complaint that is said over and over,  episdoe after episode is that they arelady have to much they nee to fit into the alloted time. they simply dont have the aritime it would take in a single episode to really build up a complex villain to much,  while still keeping the Mane 6 in the action for a good chunk of the episode.

            I think as mentioned above,  it's not so much they're jerks,  but they are unmotivated jerks. Gilda is a jerk but despite having a decent motive,  isn't very consistant about it,  or even her hatred of Pinkie.
<p></p>Characters like the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooneyTunes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a> villains are good examples. Daffy is a bastion of negative qualities,  but they are almost all motivated by his sense of self entitlement and his insecurities against Bugs. Even when he does pick on someone for fun it's more in an inpersonal prankster sense like Discord than "I'm a jerk so will be nasty to that guy over there". Similarly Elmer and Sylvester hunt out of an ambition and are usually tranquil beings outside of it.

            @van: One thing you should know is that S2E11 through S2E13 premiered <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfOrder" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfOrder">Out Of Order</a>,  so there's a choice of whether to watch them in order ("Family Appreciation Day" -&gt; "Baby Cakes" -&gt; "Hearth's Warming Eve") or by airdate ("Hearth's Warming Eve" -&gt; "Family Appreciation Day" -&gt; "Baby Cakes"). Another thing you should know is that there are two versions of S2E14 "The Last Roundup",  the difference being that one scene was redone.
