            Ginger: No,  but it's a valid potential concern. As much as you like throwing <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccamsRazor" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccamsRazor">Occam's Razor</a> around,  it does not account for everything. Also,  your interpretation doesn't necessarily make fewer new assumptions. In fact,  the most important point to your argument is 'the blast will work on the statue.' That's a big assumption.

            Um... since when has conflicting fanon ever been such a big deal? I mean,  there is no evidence for or against either theory,  so this argument is pointless. Just think whatever you want,  regardless of whatever others think.

            I wasn't arguing in favor of them being made immortal. I was merely pointing out that the fridge logic if they aren't is bad. And we do have a reason to assume it may not work: They've never done it before. No one has ever tried. Celestia didn't ask them to blast it. This may be because she didn't know he'd break loose,  or it could be because it wouldn't work. All we know for sure is that the elements will pass out of the hands... hooves... of the main cast eventually,  and then they do,  Discord's statue will begin to revert.
<p></p>Also,  please don't cite logical arguments and then say 'I believe this because it's what I want to believe.' That is really,  really annoying.

            @Arha The implication that Celestia knew that Discord would eventually escape,  and,  knowing this,  failed to contact the mane cast about it at any point seems very out of character for someone as clever as she is. The logical assumption is that she didn't realize until Discord actually escaped (either that,  or she purposefully withheld the information from them for some unknown reason)
<p></p>Would it have worked? Would it NOT have worked? We have no evidence for either option. I'm just going by what's most in-keeping with this show's tone and setting.
<p></p>What's wrong with saying that I want to believe something? As long as I'm giving logical reasons to back it up

<p></p>But Aj and fluttershy would probably dislike it and Dash would completely ignore her horn.
<p></p>However as much as I love this theory I have to admitt the show would lose any conflict the moment they became goddes.

            For what it's worth,  I assume that Celestia didn't know that he would break out,  but I also don't think blasting a statue would do anything. However,  it's just a matter of interpretation. And I don't feel like arguing. Suffice to say,  I was only pointing out an obvious future issue rather than arguing they ought to become immortal or alicorns or anything like that. Doesn't really make much sense and the only one I think would reasonably have any kind of chance of doing something like that is probably Twilight. Which would be pointless.
<p></p>Anyway,  Jteeth review comment: I find myself comparing my analyzation<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> Why is this coming up as misspelled?</div></span> and writing to yours,  so apart from the reviews itself I find it interesting to realize how little I focus on <em>how</em> a story does something like establish a mood or foreshadow. When I am writing or analyzing I just look at the whys and whats for the most part. If that makes sense.

            Fallen: I think it could still be interesting.  I mean,  they'd still be the same ponies personality-wise.  I guess all that power would probably kill the intensity of any adventure episodes,  but with power comes temptation.  They could easily still have some slice of life type of stuff where they get into mischievous shenanigans.  Despite that,  I don't really like the ascension idea,  myself.  But then again,  I have a fairly cynical view of immortality.

<p></p>Keep in mind Ahra that Gingy is one of the most....dedicated...fans of the show. He has a very strong emotional attachment to it and his views on it. He never actually means to insult or offened anyway,  he just gets passioant about his opinions.
