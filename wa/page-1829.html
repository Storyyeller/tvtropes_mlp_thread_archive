            Yeah,  a bit of overconfidence is 120% in character for Dash. She reached the balloon before it hit the ground; it's just that she <em>didn't</em> reach the balloon before whoever was in the costume for that scene extracted the victim.

            ^Her friends weren't in immediate danger in that scene; if she had gone with the Shadowbolts,  yes,  they'd have been screwed,  but that definitely isn't the same thing as going to the margins of when someone plummeting to their death or horrible injury can be saved.  That definitely felt out-of-character for her - or rather,  in-character given an exaggeration of her existing character traits.

            Maybe she has platform horseshoes but they're MAGIC so you can't tell.
<p></p>In all seriousness,  they probably didn't have an exact height for her yet since she didn't do much in that episode.

            Ever consider that maybe moments like these were why the mane cast wanted to teach RD a lesson in humility in the first place? because her arrogance and egotism were actually beginning to ENDANGER people? She THREW a baby
<p></p>That's why it didn't feel out of character to me. It's what RD would be like if she let her ego (which is already quite massive) go to her head

They still aren't exactly the same,  and she's definitely a <em>little</em> smaller in the top image,  but it's close enough that I'm not sure whether the change in size was intentional or just a byproduct of how the scene was set up.

            agreed,  Rainbow's biggest flaw is pride,  this episode basically showed what happens when that goes to far,  she became more concerned with being praised for saving ponies,  then actually saving ponies. And it even led into it realistically,  at first she really was just trying to help,  and it was only after all the other ponies started praising her non-stop that she let it get to her.

That's kind of why I was kind of bugged by the other five's behavior. I would have been more accepting if RD had already been putting ponies at risk with her behavior,  but until that point (and need I remind you they had decided to go through with their plan before this scene) RD had been doing just fine. Without that other factor it really just feels like the other five just said "our friend is getting a big head we need to do something about it. Oh,  I know,  let's dress up as a superhero and show her up at every opportunity possible. Brilliant!"

            She dismissively threw a baby. That's when the cast first started getting annoyed by her. (though still admitting she was awesome) Dash had also started using her catch phrase by the time she saved those <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OAPs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OAPs">OA Ps</a>,  wasting time that she could've spent saving them. It was gradual,  but it was clear that it was only gonna get worse.

            I have to agree with Ginger here.  (Granted,  throwing the baby one's just rescued is one of those <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeenItAMillionTimes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeenItAMillionTimes">Seen It a Million Times</a> tropes - think <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrHorriblesSingAlongBlog" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrHorriblesSingAlongBlog">Captain Hammer</a>.)  If Dash hadn't spent her catchphrase (and the ensuing <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhraseCatcher" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhraseCatcher">Phrase Catcher</a> conversation with the disturbingly hirsute pony in the... bus...?) allowing the thing to build up momentum,  she might have been able to stop it by herself,  for instance.

<p></p>That all really would have been fine if it felt like the episode was focusing on that,  but it really didn't. I guess what I'm trying to say is that while all of you got the impression that the other five were trying to prevent Dash's ego from causing serious harm,  I got the impression that her friends found her new bigger head to be really annoying and wanted her to stop being so obnoxious.
<p></p>This episode probably would have been better if it had the aesop of "you shouldn't put your own desire for recognition over the lives of the ponies your trying to help",  but instead we get a reversal of Boast Busters and that's all.
