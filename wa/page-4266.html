            I remember seeing a few fluffy ponies a few months back,  before the trend died off a bit.  I'm not really sure what sparked it or caused the resurgence.

            OK,  I have just caught up on the last 30-40 or so pages,  and here are my thoughts, 
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/derpy-has-been-modified.html">Derpy drama<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> I'm not sure what to think. Since the DVD episode is unaltered,  and we don't know what the ep will be like on the hub,  it could just be Itunes only. Also,  Derpy will still be in the show,  Derp eyes and all I'm not sure if they will voice her with the new or old voice,  I kind of like the new one though. I do wonder if they will ever call her Derpy again though... As for who did it,  I doubt it was the team themselves,  but perhaps one Hasbro superior not wanting to risk complaints and possibly lawsuits from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">moral Guardians</a>. (and not understanding that they would be far more complaining if they change it,  though probably less lawsuits...)
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/episode-hurricane-fluttershy.html">On to better news,  A new Fluttershy episode!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>  I think my reaction can be summed up by this:
<p></p><center><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="425" height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qUb9hvjobUs?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p></p>We has a assertiveshy episode,  a dragon episode,  a time travel episode,  and more Fluttershy (and presumably RD) episode. WOOP!

            I'm actually kinda upset that Shy is a pretty good flyer.

<p></p>Does that mean she's a weak flier because of her <em>self-consciousness</em>? Wouldn't be surprising,  actually.

            New synopsis fills me with dissapiontment honestly. It sounfs like it is going to Dragonshy 2.0,  and I did not particularly care for that episode.
<p></p>This is the second synopsis that has given me a sense of rehashing this season (the other is About Time or whatever it is called) its getting kind of annoying.

            @Ginger,  Why make it something forced upon her? It speaks more about a character when it's their own decision.
<p></p>@Mio,  with the sort of character Fluttershy is it's difficult to not make any of her episodes essentially Dragonshy 2.0. If there was a bit more too her we'd probably get a greater variety.

            Really,  it's because her being a strong flyer undermines all the hard work that RD puts into practicing.
<p></p>Fluttershy doesn't regularly do any kind of exertive flying,  so IMO it doesn't make sense for her to be astrong flyer

            I don't know,  the only time I could say that Fluttershy was a great flier was during 'The Return of Harmony Part 2',  and there she was in rage mode. Other times her flying always seemed average,  and not better than RD at all.
