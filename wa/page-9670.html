            @Bluespade: Yeah,  I completely agree with you on the humor thing.  I've always liked character based humor way more than the lolrandom variety.
<p></p>Also,  I just broke in my <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerpuffGirls" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerpuffGirls">Powerpuff Girls</a> dvds.  So much nostalgia.
<p></p>@Fallen: Thanks.  I'm really trying to stay true to the characterization.

It's a bit on the expensive side,  but you get the whole series,  the christmas special,  and an impressive amount of extras.  If they do something like this for MLP I will throw money at them so hard that their grandparents will be rich.

            The way I see it,  the "lol random" humor can be funny,  it's just that almost 98% of the time it fails miserbly.

            Yeah,  sometimes the unexpected can be hilarious,  it's just that a lot of shows use it as a crutch.  It's best when it catches you off guard,  and when you're spamming random stuff the surprise is lost.

            With me and random humor depends on pacing. The joke needs to come right at ya,  be funny,  then over in flash. Leaving you dazed,  but still moving the episode forward.

            Yeah,  if Pinkie's entire humor relied purely on just spouting Non Sequiturs,  she'd be incredibly annoying. The fact that there's kinda a method to her madness helps a lot; you can trace her thought process enough to tell that she isn't just grabbing stuff at random,  but we don't get enough of it that it's mostly unexpected.  Like the keeping eyepatches stashed around Ponyville,  it's random,  but Pinkie's the kind of pony who would do something like that.  The fact that it's an in-universe quirk helps a lot as well.

            <span class="blue">Take a show like Family Guy,  and there's a joke.  The characters are being used as mouthpieces to tell the joke,  mostly to set up a cut to a visual representation of said joke for a few brief seconds that has nothing to do with the rest of the episode.  It doesn't matter which character is speaking.  They don't have to have a <em>reason</em> to be talking.  The characters are interchangeable.  They have some characteristics,  some traits of their own,  sure,  but when joke time comes around they are all just mouthpieces.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">MLP avoids that almost entirely.  The characters are almost always In Character,  so the writers have to think of some way that makes sense for the characters to say something funny,  which requires more clever thinking.</span>

            @Blue: Actually,  you brought up a good point yet again. I've been waiting a long time for someone to compare the humor of mlp fim vs Family Guy's humor.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>Though I still stand by my stance that the first three seasons of Family Guy were pretty good,  and actually sometimes used it's charectors for things besides jokes.

            Yeah,  jokes are funnier when there's some kind of semi-consistent logic at work. Seriously,  Discord doesn't even realize how lame his randomness is.

            Yeah,  for the most part there was at least an odd internal logic to Monty Python,  and you could sort of see the (totally insane) progression from one sketch to another. The 4th season is very haphazard,  but I did like the Mr. Neutron story for telling a cohesive story.
<p></p>LOLRANDOM for the sake of it isn't all that interesting.

            @Chad: I would suggest that it works without prior knowledge of the character because the episode does a good job of setting up Twilight's obsessive nature. Once the madness begins,  you can already understand why she would freak out over something like that.
<p></p>It works if you know something about her,  and it also works in a self-contained way.
