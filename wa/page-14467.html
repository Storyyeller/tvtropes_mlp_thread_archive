<p></p>Well you already told us enough to let us know which game you're working on. I guess the point is to maintain plausible denialbility.
<p></p>As for the company,  it might be possible with some detective work. I think you posted a Harlem Shake photo a while back which might be identifiable.

            I'm currently bidding for 18 GW models from the second edition era (mid 90s).  They are solid lumps of plastic.  No posing possible...just slot them into their bases and attach the guns and backpacks.  At the moment they'll cost about £25.  And I only want them for their guns,  their backpacks...and their <strong>heads.</strong>  But it'll be worth it for the originality.  The current guns of my faction look like big blank planks with no real features.  These older guns are thinner and more interesting looking...and their heads have really cool looking berets that you simply can't get in any of the newer kits.  So,  all in all I think it's worth it.
<p></p>And thank you Librarian. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">

<p></p>Depends on what you're working with.  Self-teaching is a great way to end up with a 2D RPG that runs slower than AAA action titles,  because good optimization steps and proper caching are rarely the sort of thing that shows up in tutorials.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">One of the problems with working in the entertainment industry,  particularly the video games industry where information is so tightly coveted is that I'm simply not allowed to talk about my job.

<p></p>He's not kidding.  Publishers are fucking cutthroat about this,  especially in QA where anything that <em>does</em> get leaked is probably about embarrassing bugs.

<p></p>AAA games also require a large team and budget of millions. It's not something an individual developer's going to be concerned with. Anyway,  there is information about optimization online thourgh developer talks and the like,  though industry experience does help a lot.

            It's the internet.  Sexualizing cartoon characters,  even distinctly nonhuman ones,  is a disturbing but hardly new kind of ohgodwhy.

            That and I thought the show was mediocre at best anyway. The "worst" episodes aren't actually honestly bad for the show. I was more or less trying to connect with people similar to Abed from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Community" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Community">Community</a>.

<p></p>There will always be fringe peoples in the fandoms no matter what (See R34) that will have their interests. As for why they do. Its up to them. Some do it for the pervesity of it all. some do it for entertainment. Some like the characters. And for some,  the characters represent ideals just not found in people nowadays,  this is especially true of us who are for the most part isolationist.
<p></p>If we want to get into that <em>other</em> argument I can go down a long line of what the definition of sapience means and why it can be applied to cartoon ponies who speak and understand perfect english,  Something that animals on earth,  cannot.

            Yeah,  if one's going to cut oneself off from the fandom over its questionable acts,  one would also have to stop using the internet entirely to be consistent. I can understand disengaging if the unsavory stuff is <em>impossible</em> to avoid,  but in my experience it isn't.
<p></p>As far as reasons to disown the fandom,  not liking the show makes a lot more sense.

            I'm guessing a ton of people tend to fall for others more for their personalities than their bodies,  and apparently some brains don't care if the individuals in question aren't even human or even exist,  if their personalities are good enough. That's my guess.

            I second what Blissey said.  And sure the r34 can get out of hand,  but what fandom doesn't go overboard with that eventually.  Unless it's completely overwhelming the whole fandom,  it's no reason to leave.  Just ignore it and get on with your own thing.  If however,  you don't like the show anyway,  then what does it matter.

            Oh outdated computer software,  why do you have to be so difficult? I've got two archives of 1980s computer game music that are more or less the same. However,  one's in a format only listenable by a clunky emulator in Japanese and the other's compressed in a image file of a floppy drive that's all but impossible to convert into a zip.
<p></p>Sorry,  nothing to do with ponies of course,  but it's really getting on my nerves.
<p></p>Edit: Ah,  we're on that topic now. Surprising how little it seems to come up on most pony sites. The rule seems to be most fan sites at least regulate clop to it's own section or dump them on their own sites altogether. This actually the most mature fandom about rule 34 I've seen. Our reputation for it's a little blown out of proportion compared to what actually goes on.
