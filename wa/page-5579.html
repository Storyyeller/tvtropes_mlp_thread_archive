            Ok,  now for the Ironborns. They get Seaponies. That's right,  you heard me. Now,  since G4 doesn't have any seaponies,  I have to look at previous generations for names,  and the three seaponies I'm going with are Wavedance,  Seawinkle,  and Sealight,  who find their way to the Iron Islands where they meet Aeron Greyjoy. POV characters for this section are Theon and Wavedancer. Also,  I never said I wasn't sending Fluttershy to Westeros.
<p></p>Current POV characters:
<ul><li>Spike
</li><li>Tyrion
</li><li>Sansa
</li><li>Aggo
</li><li>Garble
</li><li>Arya

            Ok,  then. Next I'd say the Renly focus. Now,  Cat is sent there like in the books,  so no change there,  nor a viewpoint from her,  until she reaches Renly,  however,  Pinkie Pie also goes there,  and <em>she</em> meets Renly too. When Cat arrives,  she too speaks with Pinkie,  and gets word back to the Princess,  causing her to send an emissary to the North as well. The POV characters for this section are Cat and Brienne. (Don't want to even try to go in Pinkie's head.)

            Say high to Apple for me! And read them. They're always good for a laugh.
<p></p>Ooh,  Ooh,  also: Ginger,  I just watched <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHungerGames" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a>,  you might like it. The 'villain' is pretty much the only character I felt any degree of sympathy for in the entire 2 and a half hour movie. Aside from that it's pretty meh,  though. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> I went to see it with a friend to riff it. I think the theatre probably hated us. There was a scene where this big riot suddenly cut to the main character crying in the woods,  and the entire theatre was dead silent... except for us two,  who were laughing our asses off in a corner.</span>

            The books were pretty good. Don't see why you went to riff on the movie.

            I never read the books,  and my friend doesn't care for them - his girlfriend is a diehard fan and he just plain old dislikes them,  so yeah. All I know about them is that the evil government has the absolute worst system in place,  bar none.
<p></p>He and I simply enjoy making fun of movies together. Make no mistake,  there was plenty of material,  but we can go see a genuinely good movie together and still have shit to make fun of.
<p></p>And yes,  the editing for the entire thing is horrible. It has absurd levels of shaky cam,  especially during fight scenes,  which makes it impossible to tell whats going on. Not to mention it loves extreme close ups like I love Soarin.

            The name of the sort of apparent villain is Cato - he's another competitor in the games,  probably the <em>most</em> competent one there. He still does die in the end,  but it's two on one and he's pretty much given up at that point anyways.
<p></p>There is,  of course,  the bigger baddie,  who operates on xanatos gambit sort of territory. He's the president of the whole empire. We don't see much of him,  but he's pretty cool. He sounds like he knows his stuff,  at least.

            Dammit. Now all I got on my mind is how to write a Discworld/MLP crossover. Except that I already have this other fanfic I'm working on that I feel I should finish first. That,  and I've only read four of the novels,  so I don't know enough about it either. Darn it.
<p></p>Anyhow,  Ginger,  you should totally read Discworld. It's British comedy at it's finest.

            If you seriously asked me,  I'd recommend Discworld. Just one book,  go on. I won't force you,  but will definitely recommend it :D
