            I'm trying to think of ways to get a unicorn fighter to work.  Like rather than using real spells he'd mostly just use telekinesis to swing weapons or something.  The other magic would largely be just buffs,  with maybe a few other spells for variety.
<p></p>Also,  how are we working out stuff like HP and magic cost?

            Also,  would it work to give EP's a passive skill that makes them use potions more efficiently.  Like a healing potion would recover 25 HP instead of 20 if an EP is using it.

            Hm.  Good question about HP,  would all ponies have a uniform die size,  or would it be determined in part by the pony's special talent?
<p></p>As for what I'm playing,  I'm considering playing my Folklorist-type,  Shining Promise or Stinging Nettles,  my Apothecary character.  I'll probably go for playing Stinging Nettles.

            Skills are woefully incomplete at the moment,  and will probably be that way for a long while. What I'm thinking is that if we want to start up an Alpha Version game,  we can essentially make up skills as we go,  tuning for balance and such as needed. There needs to be almost anything that a player might want in the system,  so actually playing a test game to see what they want first hand is probably the best way to go about it at first.

            Stat and skill point boost is already their thing,  as I understand. You can give them more perks,  but to balance things out,  you would have to take away the freebies they already have.

<p></p>I was originally planning to call it Fetlock Holmes,  but then I discovered that someone else already wrote a fanfic by that name. So now I'm thinking about the name Private Eye. It seems like a more typical pony name anyway.

            I'm sort of teetering between a Pegasus bard/scout - Basically recycling a character I made in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverWinterNights2" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverWinterNights2">Never Winter Nights 2</a> with a few small changes - he specializes in storytelling because he would always sneak away from work and would have to make up excuses for where he went. So he'd be a good sneaker and a good storyteller(Could also multi-class in rogue,  there). He'd be a bit of a coward,  not one to actually get involved in fights,  but he'd still care enough to try and support his friends where he could. Bards are essentially a support class,  so he'd be able to provide buffs to the team. In theory if I get his sneak high enough he can stealth around the battlefeild and shiv the monsters in the kidneys while they aren't looking.
<p></p>My second option is a unicorn cleric with a bit of a temper. She knows all the healing spells,  all of the buff spells,  but she's not really a team player. She just soaks the buffs onto herself,  then wades into the fight.
<p></p>A third,  though less likely option,  is a straight healer EP - He'd heal using potions and herbs. I could maybe have him learn a few combat potions,  but I'm still kinda debating whether he'd be a pacifist or not.

            @JT HP is going to be a function of you CON score and whatever skills happen to apply to it. We may just want to straight up copy an HP formula from another system as a starting point. As for magic,  I like the D&D style of frequency limitations (at-will,  once per encounter,  daily,  etc),  but with spells of variable strength (like telekinesis) It should probably dip into <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">Cast from Hit Points</a> to represent overexerting yourself.
