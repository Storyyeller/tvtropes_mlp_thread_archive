But he was definitely a really great actor,  one of my favorites. I'd feel better if he got his own movie.
<p></p>Hawkeye,  too. He was honestly pretty sweet - he had just enough to make you believe he deserved to be there,  but I'd like to see him more on his own.

            @Story: Ooh,  tough one actually. I'm gonna say Avengers,  though. Cabin in the Woods is good for horror,  but if you're not into that it's a bit of a rough trip. It's interesting and kinda fun,  but so is the Avengers. Offhand I'd say they're about equal(They're both Joss Whedon movies),  but Avengers is the most 'friendly' one.
<p></p>Although if you don't recognize <em>anything</em> from the comics or previous movies it'll be a bit tricky to follow at first. It does rely a bit on it's viewers having seen the lead-in.

Taste sort of candy-ish,  flat,  round,  no brand on them? Pepto Bismol is that stuff in liquid form. It's decent. Solves the problems it sets out to,  that's for sure.

            @Seraph I think the problem is that some people AREN'T going to have seen the other movies. There's a tenant in film making that a work should stand on its own

            true,  but doing it this way allows for a much better narrative overall,  which most poeple will be able to know about and see,  only a few not knowing they need some background info first.

            @Ginger I'd say that it's okay to assume that most people are at least familiar with pop culture icons. I mean,  who isn't going to know who <em>Captain America</em> is,  or <em>The Hulk</em>?

            @Perpetual but there are elements in the film,  like the Tesirak (I think that's how it's spelt) and how it relates to Thor and Captain America that might confuse people initially

            It's at least very <em>interesting</em>,  as a thing - that is to say,  it's an interesting experiment. And it's certainly a big deal,  enough so that most people will recognize the faces if nothing else. Even still,  it's a bit odd.
<p></p>In other news,  after the movie I was having dinner with my mother,  and I heard someone complaining about the new spider man movie... because he had web-shooters. She was saying that if he can't shoot webs from his wrists,  he isn't really spider man,  because spider man is part spider.

            I LOVE that they are doing this,  just becuase something is tradition doesn't mean it's ALWAYS right,  it's GREAT to see film makers going out on a limb to do something risky,  but oh so worth the payoff.

            It's not really a problem though,  I think they did a good job of setting up all of them just with their introduction scenes. I never saw the Hulk movie,  but wasn't very confused over him. Although I'm familiar with the characters in general,  so that might have helped. <br> <br>Even if you don't know what the Tesseract is exactly,  it's pretty obvious that it's a really powerful energy source. You don't have to know where it came from to know that Loki getting it is a problem.
