            @Steve You do realized that "wholesale copypasted" mean that it would have the same melody,  rhythm,  etc.,  right? Give Mr. Ingram more credit than that. It's more of a stylistic homage than a copypaste ripoff.

            I didn't think it was too bad,  mainly because it was actually from Twilight's POV rather than just being a generic "big brothers are awesome!" song.  Again,  it actually had some relevance in bringing us up to speed on Twilight's relationship with him.

"Stop and listen to people when they try to explain things to you" is a perfectly valid lesson; problem is that the episode actually showed a lesson more along the lines of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a>.

            The thing about Find a Pet and the Flim Flam Brothers Song is that they double as exposition,  not just a musical interlude,  <em>and</em> they're inspired by other songs. The talking is entirely appropriate in them.

            I think Find A Pet worked better though,  mainly because it didn't have a chorus that took up a good chunk of the time.

<p></p>Also will people stop saying "i know I'll catch flak",  or "I know I'll get flamed" when do we ever do that? Sure maybe some good aatured ribbing,  but no actual harshness.

<p></p><span class="blue">PERSONAL POST:  Thank god for Jim Butcher.  A few weeks ago I made the painful decision to scrap the novel I'd been working on for about 4 or 5 months.  I had absolutely no plans for another novel and was feeling completely uncreative.  I've suffered writer's block in the past,  for huge chunks of time.  But by using the excellent writing advice that Butcher gives on his site,  I was able to very quickly outline an entire novel that will be the first of a series.  It is now completely ready for me to start writing,  plotted all the way through,  so I don't have to struggle with the plot as I go.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Tangentially related:  I wouldn't have become a fan of Butcher,  and therefore discovered his writing craft,  if it weren't for this thread,  so big thanks to everyone who ever mentioned the Dresden Files in the thread here.</span>

            @Blue: Bronibooru is basically the pony equivalent of Safebooru,  if I remember right.  It only allows worksafe pictures.  Which is great if you aren't interested in r34,  but it also means that not nearly as many people use it,  which means a lower number of pictures.

            Keep in mind that I'm working off memory and I might be thinking of something else.
<p></p>EDIT: Okay,  now I remember why it's not as widely used: it can be uber-strict about the content to the point that shipping isn't allowed unless it's a canonical couple.  Understandably,  if you're into shipping,  that greatly reduces the appeal.

            Yeah,  explicit images are hidden by default,  and I have my personal settings rigged to also hide questionable images. So it's functionally identical to Safebooru in that regard.
<p></p>What I like about Derpibooru's system over the old Ponibooru is that I can still look at questionable-tagged images linked from here,  I just have to do a clickthrough instead of being forcibly and unceremoniously dumped to the frontpage.
