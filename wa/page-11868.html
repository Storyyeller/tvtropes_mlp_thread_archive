            Seriously in this episode she's like a proto-J. Jonah Jameson.  I love it.  Her cartoonish villainy in this episode is way more interesting than her <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a> antics elsewhere.  Also this episode has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Cakelestia</span>,  which automatically bumps it up a few slots.

            @Librarian When she calls them "geniuses" and acts generally pleased with them. Sure,  it was only because they were doing exactly what she wanted,  but it does show that she can turn off bitch-mode when she wants to.

            Earth ponies — Specializes in defense,  and is well suited to a strategy that involves slow but steady expansion,  and standing their ground against all comers. Special units include the Groundshaker,  a siege unit that can slow down ground units and deal massive damage to structures.
<p></p>Pegasi — Specializes in mobility,  their units are faster and have greater visual range but tend to be weaker in strength. Their cloud structures,  though relatively fragile,  can be packed up and moved elsewhere,  which can be useful when losing to a siege,  or just migrating to greener pastures.
<p></p>Unicorns — Their units are the most fragile,  but they make up for it with plenty of combat tricks and strong magic-based attacks. All units have an energy meter that depletes when they cast spells. Units include Rejuvenators (can heal or recharge other units),  Protectors (can deploy a bubble shield centered around itself that depletes energy when it absorbs a hit),  and Jumpers (an advanced unit that can teleport short distances).

            I think the main reason is that our perception of the races are kinda skewed.  RD and Twilight are basically top tier in their races' respective abilities (flight and magic),  and it tends to be rather important for them.  RD is a huge showoff who's life revolves around flying,  and Twilight is the personal pupil of the Princess.
<p></p>The Earth Ponies don't get that sort of opportunity to show off; AJ isn't one to really brag,  and Pinkie is explicitly considered weird by the other characters,  so people tend to write off her abilities as not being race related.  TL;DR pegasi and unicorn powers simply come up a lot more often in the show than earth pony special abilities.  Doesn't mean that they aren't useful or strong,  just that whatever their abilities are don't make for interesting plotlines.
<p></p>@Blue: Big Mac dragged a house and tossed half the town over the horizon without any real trouble,  and it only takes four earth ponies to pull a <em>train</em>.  We've never seen any of the other pony races do anything close to that.

            A bit of headcanon I have is that Cherilee keeps trying to show her students that they can handle responsibility (like,  say,  running a school newspaper by themselves),  but to her constant annoyance,  they keep finding creative new ways to prove otherwise.
