            You have to remember that picking and bucking apples are rather different. The former is demanding,  but it's not the kind of activity that will make one buff.

            You don't ever,  <em>ever</em>,  kick trees.
<p></p>To start with,  it's a complete waste of energy. If a tree is so small that you can kick the fruits off of it,  you can just shake it off with your hands,  which will knock out much more fruits with less energy.
<p></p>Also,  repeatedly kicking trees is <em>devastating</em> for your joints. Yes,  in ancient days,  those muay thai practitioners would practice by kicking trees,  but guess what,  they were stupid and they had much shorter career than today's practioners.
<p></p>So yeah,  kicking trees for <em>any reason</em> (the only possible exception is if you don't have any functional arms) is just stupid. One shouldn't do that. <em>Ever.</em>

            Fair enough.
<p></p>I guess lifting heavy baskets of apples in addition to other physical work can still keep her toned though.  I'm just torn between making her lean with 'ropey' defined muscles or beefy with big but sort of hidden muscles.

            @ed - Yeah,  but he's talking about <em>humanized</em> version,  which does come with a pair of functional arms (unless you bought it in Radioactive Co.; it might come with three instead).
<p></p>@story - Yeah,  I know. That's even stupider.
<p></p>Seriously,  why exactly does AJ need to constantly buck the tree? It's not even THAT tall; I once volunteered in an apple farm,  and pretty much all the fruits were within my height,  and I'm only six feet. Hell,  if connotations are concerned (Read:Not technical),  it really shouldn't even be called a tree at all.
<p></p>Yeah,  ponies are smaller,  but still,  you'd think that Apple Family,  who probably have been farming apple since the age of dinosaur,  would have been able to come up with (I don't know the technical term) one that is short enough for them to just pick.
<p></p>There is a reason why Granny Smith's hip went FUBAR.

            Or she could just climb up a branch and pick. Presumably earth ponies having a lot more strength than the average human allows them to shake the tree or some such. Which in that case,  enough bucking would  just crack the thing.
