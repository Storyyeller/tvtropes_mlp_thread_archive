            <div class="quoteblock">There's also a thread in Yack Fest where all the socializing is theoretically supposed to go.
<p></p>Ironically,  the YF thread predates crackdown on derails,  and it was initially more on-topic than this one. </div>
<p></p>Yep,  that was what I was referring to. That and the Spoiler thread.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I honestly don't mind the slower post rate since 1. it's easier to follow and 2. 2/3rd of the posts before were either off-topic or Ginger raging about something. I seriously remember that it wasn't an uncommon occurrence to go 2 or 3 pages with ponies not being mentioned once. So yeah,  it's slower,  but only because we cut out all the filler. That and if we add the fanfic,  spoiler,  comic,  and yack fest threads in we're still producing a ridiculous amount of discussion. </div>
<p></p>First off,  discussion in the other threads doesn't really count because it's too much work to keep track of more than one thread,  so if it doesn't happen here,  I don't see it.
<p></p>As for activity,  on the one hand it is nice that I can keep up with the thread without spending much time checking it. On the other hand,  I really miss the community chatroom aspect it used to have where you could just talk to people about whatever you feel like and people would respond within minutes and you could actully chat. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YackFest" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YackFest">Yack Fest</a> doesn't really work since it's dead and even this thread isn't really active enough to support real time conversations anymore.

            @Story: I see what you mean,  but honestly the "chat room" aspect of it was kind of a mixed bag because of all the ninja'ing that happened,  and it was always frustrating to come to the thread to discuss ponies only to have to slog through pages of people talking about pokemon or whatever.  Relevant stuff got lost in the rust really easily.
<p></p>Also,  if they made a show accurate Twilight plush I would buy it so fast.  Also if they made pretty much any official Chrysalis toy,  simply because it would be the most badass-looking MLP figure ever.

            I'm with that. I'm certainly not here to talk about <em>Pokemon</em>. It's all about <em>Pony</em>.
<p></p>About the plushies— I myself have a Pinkie Pie,  a Twilight Sparkle and a Fluttershy,  each in a different size. The Fluttershy is the newest— only just came out earlier this month. Very in demand at the moment.

            Are those the official ones? I've been tempted to buy them,  but the manes just look kinda weird. That and all the customs are far out of my price range.

            <strong>Japanese Teeth</strong>,  yes. The mane issue is the ribbons for hair,  but if you can get over it,  they're actually quite nice. Particularly the Fluttershy,  because she's so cute,  and the 20" one is so large that it can reasonably be used as a pillow.
<p></p>Your best bet might be one of the 5" small ones. I actually sell them myself on eBay,  and I'm willing to ship First Class International,  which is the lowest rate you can get,  though there may or may not be additional customs fees depending on one's country.
<p></p>I do feel for those that live in places where they make it so hard to get this merchandise. Hopefully they see and continue to see that it's to their benefit to get more of it out there and keep getting it out.

            Ace: What Teeth said,  I guess?
<p></p>The new official plushies look really good.  Can't wait for them to come out so I can nab one of each of the medium sized ones.
<p></p>At the moment,  I do have one of the punk haired official Twis.  And the Dashie backpack is basically a plushie (her storage capacity is rather laughable).
<p></p>For unofficial,  I own 3 Twis,  one of which is a badly hand sewn one I made myself,  and the others being crochet and a fancy Gala!Twi.  Plus a crochet Dusky,  Spike,  Fluttershy,  jumbo size Fluttershy,  and jumbo size Pinkie.

            I'm certainly curious about the Build-a-Bear Workshop <em>Pony</em> thing as well,  and definitely intend to check it out as soon as it becomes available. There's one in the mall right nearby where I live,  so it's no problem. I wonder if they have any idea what's going to hit them once they go live. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin">
<p></p>P.S.: I'm actually kinda surprised that they apparently have no interest in doing any plush or anything of the Cutie Mark Crusaders. The Crusaders are the major characters on the show that are actually kids,  and you would think that would be a prime target for something like plush toys.
<p></p>In fact,  there is very little official Cutie Mark Crusader merchandise in general. The only one I know off off-hand is the Wedding Flower Fillies set.

            Oh,  yea,  the Build-A-Bear stuff!  Almost forgot about those.  I'm excited to see what options they have,  because unless the one near me closed down (possible,  since the mall isn't terribly thriving,  but still),  it might offer me an easy way to build plushies of Dusky and some of my friends' OCs.

            On one hand,  it's a human religion and quite out of place. On the other hand,  the description technically makes sense. Plenty of women in Islamic countries do wear veils. In Saudi Arabia,  it's a law for women to wear an abaya.

            @darkabomination: As I was asleep at the time,  yeas <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/CRISISEquestria" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/CRISISEquestria">CRISIS Equestria</a> is a lot of fun. So I agree with those who recomended it. It's not perfect,  but it's still really entertaining. Mainly due to its <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs">O Cs</a> and worldbuilding. Equestria V i a fascinating place and it's cool to read about ponies in superpowered battles. It <em>is</em> darker than I would have thought to bring up to you,  but honestly,  really not that bad. Also,  it has its own thread. Come over and tell us what you think.
