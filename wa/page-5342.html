            very good fic.
<p></p>It's kinda wierd since it's written as a transcript of a radio talk show,  but it's very very hilarious,  and has quite a few haertwarming moments too. Plus season one ends with Blueblood's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">Humiliation Conga</a>,  what's to love?

            I listened to one of the audio things. Commercial was funny but the voice actresses for the leads left something to be desired.
<p></p>I'm put off of reading it because I'm somewhat wary of shipfics,  especially things that look like they didn't really <em>need</em> to be shipfics but inserted shipping anyway. And massively overdone pairings,  that's also a "meh" thing to me.

            OK so I had the coolest dream last night.  It was a cross between Pokemon and MLP.
<p></p>I had a pony friend that I called Twilight yet she was an Alicorn and had a blue mane and was more of a pink color. She wasnt tall and skinny like Celestia and Luna,  just a regular sized pony with a horn and wings. I don't recall a cutie mark.  She was only about 3 feet tall at the shoulder,  Great Dane size maybe?  She could talk and do magic and everything.  For some reason my family and I were fleeing to another country to escape some sort of persecution.
<p></p>We got to this other country and ended going to this seminar,  the guy running it took a fancy to my Alicorn friend,  and my brother suggested I put her away in my locket so he'd back off.  (I used a locket instead of a Pokeball,  it was oval in shape and had a moonstone set in it).  I put her away and the seminar thing went on,  at the end the guy started challenging all the kids there to battles and keeping their pets when they lost.  When he challenged me I refused and left,  but he sent his cronies after me so I had to run and hide.
<p></p>I ran into this shop and let Twilight out of the locket and told her to hide,  then ran out of the shop and down an alley where I was caught.  They made me hand over the locket,  which I guess they didn't know was empty and left.  I went and retrieved Twilight from the shop and decided that I was better off on my own from that point on and spent the rest of the dream traveling with her.  I only fought with her once,  she used some kind of beam that came out of her horn to knock out several small enemies at once so we could get away (they were like rats or something).
<p></p>This has got to be the most detailed dream I've ever had.

<p></p>@ Pannic,  it's not really a ship-fic,  Vinyl and Octy's relationship is only referenced a few times and mostly as a set up to Vinyl's jokes.
