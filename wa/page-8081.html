But I'm not used to it. I usually go to bed around 4,  but lately I just haven't been tired at all. I'm still not. <br> <br>Oh right,  I keep forgetting,  I'm not fully caught up yet,  so my opinions are based up to chapter 20. <br> <br>I think out of all of them,  Curacao knows how to handle herself and whatever situations she could be in. <br> <br>To me,  Grayscale seems like a less cocky and energetic Rainbow. Which is probably the point,  but to me that just doesn't make her stand out much. <br> <br>Honestly,  I'm able to overlook how bad Pinkie makes Velvet just because of how effective she seems. I also really like her powers and how she knows how to use them. I'd also be lying if I wasn't a fan of really creepy things placed in stories like this. <br> <br>For Starlight,  maybe Silvertongue or Harmonia could take her? <br> <br>And on a semi-related note. Partially to practice drawing,  and partially because the image wouldn't leave my head,  I spent a while drawing them being sucked into the portal in Chapter 1. I can't say it's that great,  but I'm not a great artist,  so I don't know. I'd appreciate it if anyone could point out and possible glaring flaws or anything. <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/MLW1W.jpg">Link<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small>

<p></p>On combat theory,  I actually think that Curacao and Graysacle would be the best opponents for Pinkie simply because of her <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">Weaksauce Weakness</a> - they're so logical and practical that they'd outright claim what she's doing is impossible,  then lo,  it is!

            @Kyler: the ATB system is basically a kind of turned-based with pseudo-realtime elements. I'll admit that not everypony fits into the story well,  but a fairly reasonable job was done.

            I just hope that Pinkie wouldn't INSTANTLY see through Curie's disguise. It strikes me as the sort of thing she could do. (rolls eyes)
<p></p>I hate how she's able to do everything
<p></p>I'm honestly surprised that Curie hasn't pulled the old "pretend to be an injured friend" routine. I was really expecting her to use that on Rarity

            Oh right,  Pinkie's special. Maybe if she was distracted? Insipid could probably hold her attention by being...herself and Grayscale has the gravity thing. This would be assuming a free for all or something,  though. I'd imagine Starlight would put them 1v1.

<p></p>Actually,  I wouldn't be surprised if Curie takes the form of RD and pretends to come back to them in the next chapter,  leading them into an ambush
