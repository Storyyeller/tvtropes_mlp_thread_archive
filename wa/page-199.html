            I made the mistake of watching <em>Party of One</em> while sleep deprived. I ended up having a dream where I was being chased by angry!Fluttershy... only she was a jack-in-the-box with fangs and shot fire out of her eyes.

<div class="quoteblock">Could I get anyone to take a look at something? I've been writing a fic over the past couple of days,  but something seems...wrong,  about it to me. You should be able to look at it here. There's something about how the girl reacts to it all that doesn't seem right. She just takes it in stride too much,  I think...thoughts? </div>

            @kegisak: Personally,  I think it works just fine. But if it really bothers you,  it might help to emphasize her being scared/unsure about the situation. Just a little bit more,  here and there. Or maybe a bit or two about things being less scary as she starts to get used to things (the spirit,  particularly).

            Funny thing,  I also watched MLPFIM before going to bed (that was I after I watch something from G1 series :P) and I have dream about it.
<p></p>It was Cutie Mark Chronies and I was dreamed that I saw Sonic Rainboom in the sky (on much highter additude than in show). Before that I saw planes,  or ships or other <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UFOs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UFOs">UF Os</a> flying and dogfighting so conclusion was that Ponies probably helped with fighting <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">Alien Invasion</a>.
Sadly before when I was about to enter internet to see what goins on and how world reatcing to Ponies bein real,   alarm clock wake me up :/
<p></p>I watch some other ep before sleep maybe I got onother dream.
<p></p>BTW Twilight have few fans? Since when ?
<p></p>And about Carmel,  why everypony calls pony with horseshoes CM if pony who AJ calls Carmel was diffrent pony,  with Carmel Apples as CM (so that he was Carmel Apple,  AJ cousin). Just watch that scene from Winter Wrap Up.

            It's not so much that she only has a few fans as much as all the other ponies have more fans.  For what it's worth,  Twilight is one of my favorite ponies.

            So after stewing on my wallpaper for a bit,  I decided I really wasn't very satisfied with it.  With what I wanted to to,  I am so very happy that GIMP has introduced me to the wonders of the fuzzy/magic wand selector and layers.  Anyway,  moving on before I go off on a tangent,  I ended up not liking having the official Twilight art as the centerpiece for the pseudo cutie mark.  Not only is it assymmetrical,  but trying to work it into a formation resembling equally assymmetrical cutie mark just ended up not looking all that good.  So I moved the official art over to by the Twilight's name,  tightened up the formation and filled the resulting dead center space with a screen cap Twilight with her magical girl crown.  I also didn't like the way the square pictures sat on the outlying stars part of the cutie mark,  so I redid them.

            Holy shit,  we're in the news.
<p></p>I just grabbed a newspaper on the way to school this afternoon,  and there's an interview with Daniel Ingram(the composer for MLP) in it,  which gives quite  bit of focus to MLP's unexpected age range. It also references Rainbow Dash as 'the cool pony'. Best. Article. Ever! Also,  he mentions a song he's working on for season two,  A solo for Twilight!
