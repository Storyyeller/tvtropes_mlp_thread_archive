<p></p>A Monty Haul GM is one who basically gives out gold and other rewards like candy,  without a whole lot of challenge involved. I was thinking that Fluttershy would wind up like that because she's afraid of making people upset by actually killing their characters.
<p></p>Chandler's Law basically states "If all else fails,  have a guy burst through the door with a gun in his hand". Liven up a story by suddently introducing new conflict. So,  Rainbow would probably have ninjas bust through the doors at every opportunity.

            @Blue: I think Twilight would have some railroading issues; she doesn't think on her feet well enough to compensate for RD inevitably killing a plot-important NPC or dropping a Macguffin down a cliff something.

I'm sure there are plenty of other things more impressive than a dragon that she could come up with. They do have Tartarus,  after all.

            So,  let's see:
<p></p>Twilight would have railroading issues and too much storytime <br>Rainbow Dash would want it to be all fighting,  all the time <br>Pinkie would probably have a story too random to be coherent,  or puzzles and progression that only make sense to her <br>Fluttershy wouldn't <em>want</em> to be GM,  and wind up making things far too easy <br>Applejack would be better,  but would probably spend a bit too much time on merchants and such <br>Rarity would like the idea of the whole thing,  but would probably put a lot of focus on social encounters.
<p></p>I like the idea of Spike picking up as GM,  so that we can have a final result that's a compromise between the various styles,  without having to single out one of the six as the best. Though Rarity or Applejack probably would be the best.

            Yeah Rarity's biggest issue would be she spends more time designing and describing everything in perfect detail then actually doing anything.
<p></p>And yeah Spike would be the perfect GM,  he's got a good enough sense of humor,  intelligence,  and creativity. yeah that would work best for the end.

            Night!
<p></p>...now I kind of want to see a rendition of each of them as their potential character.
<p></p>Twilight as a Wizard (duh) <br>Rainbow Dash as a Barbarian (fits her personality) <br>Rarity as a Rogue,  Fencer,  etc (Dexterity and finesse) <br>Pinkie as a Bard (MUSIC AND PARTY) <br>Fluttershy as a Druid (animals and healing) <br>Applejack as a Warrior or Monk (The less fancy class,  fits her style)
<p></p>Does that sound about right? I know that I gave Rarity a mundane classes and Fluttershy a magic class,  but they fit,  I think.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> Oh,  it's not a bad thing. I just envision her as almost the polar opposite of Rainbow Dash's campaign.
<p></p>...Hey,  that almost forms a nice dichotomy for each one,  doesn't it?
<p></p>Twilight and Fluttershy are opposites in terms of how much control the GM tries to have <br>Rarity and Rainbow are opposites in how much fighting there would be <br>Pinkie and Applejack would,  now that I think about it,  probably be better as a split between how fantastic or mundane the game is.
<p></p>...wait,  nah. I'm not sure that Applejack's problem would be a predicatable or boring story. That doesn't sound right.

<p></p>Applejack would have issues stating any encounters.  She could probably just pick them out of a book,  but that wouldn't be very interesting.  And yeah,  Rarity would probably spend too much time on the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a>.
