            @ Story,  yup,  <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Goddess is a gestalt of Trixie,  Twilight,  and a pair of twins that were Twi's seconds in command of the MAS,  As to why Trixie is the one in charge,  numerous theories,  mine is that she just had the more dominate personality. Twi had the stronger will,  don't get me wrong,  but she always associated herself first and foremost with who she was serving,  "Celestia's prized student" "Luna's ministry Mare" etc...while Trixie always had to dominate.</span>

            Wasn't that Turtle's job? I swear she did it last time.
<p></p>I was just thinking of an idea I had for a Ponies on Earth fic. and I wanted the mane cast to all get seperated and end up in different countries. I wanted RD to end up with the american military. Rarity to end up in London. AJ in Tokyo,  Fluttershy in Egypt.
<p></p>Where do you guys think Pinkie and Twi should go? Where could they have the most hijinks? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            Then yeah,  she appears in one memory orb. The Star Orb. Personally,  I think it's the most heartwarming of the 6 orbs that Pip finds. I know a lot of others prefer the Butterfly orb or the Diamond Orb but whatever. The star orb made me smile
