            For me to say that kind of attitude is annoying is a gross understatement.  As a feminist (and by that I mean someone who is pro-gender equality and hates stupid sexist stereotyping) I was pleasantly surprised to learn about the brony community.  I personally think that in a society with sexist jerks like that guy around,  it's much more tough and brave for a man to like traditionally "girly" things than to worry about seeming to be properly masculine.
<p></p>Edit: So no one misinterprets me,  what I meant by that last sentence is that it can often be harder to have hobbies or interests that go against what society thinks one should be interested in.  I certainly don't think it's wrong for men to like traditionally masculine TV shows/movies either,  just that they would face less social pressure than those who would watch something,  like,  say "My Little Pony."  I think people should like whatever kind of media they want,  whether it's "typical" for their gender or not.
<p></p>Obviously whoever wrote that didn't watch Dragon Quest,  because I got an impression that the episode was strongly hinting at a lesson of "it's okay and even a good thing for guys to like girly things" but I guess that guy would hate that episode along with the scenes of Spike playing with the wedding toppers.
<p></p>Although that guy may not have actually watched the show,  given that the picture in the article is from G3,  so maybe he thinks it's still like those stories,  which DO have unicorns making rainbows.

            <span class="blue">Okay,  one last thing.  Noticed this comment on the article:</span>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Articles like this fascinate me. The most interesting thing is the unwritten assumption that it's normal to describe men liking wholesome,  light-hearted entertainment as 'terrifying'. What exactly is Kurt afraid of? What bad thing is going to happen?
<p></p>I think it has to do with the importance he places on the idea that a guy should "ACT LIKE A MAN!" It's an interesting choice of quote. He isn't saying that the brony should "BE A MAN" but that they should just *act* like one.
<p></p>It's as though he's putting the emphasis on the window dressing,  the outward trappings of masculinity. Why is this,  and why is it 'terrifying' to see men discard these trappings?
<p></p>I think for Kurt it's terrifying because,  deep down,  he doesn't know how to be a man. The window dressing is all there is - the signals he sends to demonstrate to people that he is,  in fact,  a man. If those signals are no longer necessary - if men can go around liking girly things without consequence - then Kurt risks being revealed for what he is: Something which only has the deliberate outer appearance and mannerisms of a man; something dressed in drag as a man.
<p></p>Bronies are terrifying and dangerous to Kurt because they bring him face to face with the awful,  emasculated 'something' that lies underneath his cheap suit and bluster.

<p></p>2.) Many times he shows signs that he honestly cares for Truman (stroking a monitor of Truman sleeping when he looked like he was having a bad dream,  then again when he was looking conflicted in the ending. During his final speech he has a damn LUMP in his throat!
<p></p>3.) In the end he let Truman go. He could've restarted the storm again,  or ordered guards to stop him and throw him back in. He persists because he honestly felt that he could convince Truman to stay one way or another. He momentarily almost kills him because he's desperate to protect Truman from the outside world (which he himself calls diseased and evil)
<p></p>4.) He started the Truman Show in the first place primarily so that he could give someone the perfect life. The show angle was merely his means of getting money to fund it.

            HOLY FUCK!! Ok this article..it is worth every idiotic word fo the comments section
<p></p>I just read some mother of a 12 year old girl well read
<p></p><em>Yeah... kinda seems off to me too. But I don't know enough to really comment on the issue. My husband and I watched plenty of cartoons with our daughter and he never developed a fixation with any of her shows- I would have been a bit disturbed if he had. Call me old fashioned,  but I prefer my men to have normal,  manly pursuits. Like football.... And the fervor with which people are defending themselves on this is strange. Whole dissertations are being written on this page. What's up with that?</em>
<p></p>which led to several back and forth <em>very polite</em> discussions with some bronies,  and ended with her agreeing that she may be being unfair to judge based on assumptions wihtout having watched any of it,  and saying she might ataully go check it out.
<p></p><strong>I BUCKING LOVE THIS FANDOM!!!</strong>

            <div class="quoteblock"> "Moondancer" sounds to me a lot like a name that would be in one of the earlier gen shows,  was there any pony named that in gen 1-3? </div>
Yes,  both Generation 1 and Generation 3 had a Moondancer,  though they looked very different.  You can bet that any time Friendship Is Magic brings up a Generation 1 pony name verbatim like that,  it's because the name had already been recycled into Generation 3,  so they'd kept the trademark up.
<p></p>So on the flip side,  Gen 3 didn't have a Cherries Jubilee,  which may be why "The Last Roundup" called her "Cherry Jubilee" instead.
