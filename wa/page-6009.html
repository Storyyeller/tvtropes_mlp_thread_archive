            After Eight Thin Mints (After Eights) are a confectionery product described as "mint enrobed in dark chocolate" (although a milk chocolate version became available in 2006) that are intended,  as its name suggests,  to be used as after-dinner mints. They were created in 1962 by Rowntree and Company Limited. Since the 1988 acquisition of the United Kingdom-based company,  the mints have been produced by Nestlé.
<p></p>The "Thin Mints" have been made in the factory in Castleford,  West Yorkshire since 1970,  and the Chocolate Truffles are made in York. After Eights are now sold across Europe and North America,  and one billion After Eight mints are made annually.[citation needed]
<p></p>In 1967,  After Eights were also manufactured at the Rowntree factory in the Wandsbek district of Hamburg.
<p></p>After Eights were originally made from dairy-free dark chocolate. However,  in 2007,  Nestlé started adding butterfat to After Eights,  making them a dairy product. Nestlé has also made special editions of After Eights,  including orange After Eights and milk chocolate After Eights.
<p></p>The fondant in the centre of After Eights is made from a stiff paste of saccharose,  water,  and a small amount of the enzyme invertase. This fondant can readily be coated with dark chocolate. After manufacture,  the enzyme gradually splits the saccharose into the much more soluble glucose and fructose,  resulting in a more liquid consistency. Maturing of the mint is said to take over three months.

            I've had After Eights before (or at least some generic form of it). I don't like mint to begin with,  so I didn't like those.

            @Ginger: I know we've at least got After Eights in Canada,  though the purpose seems to be different. The name sort of says it,  to me; they're evening mints. A sort of treat if you've got company,  I suppose. I didn't care for them as a wee'un,  but I might like them better now.
<p></p>Though,  for mostly the same purpose a lot of restaurants have after-dinner mints. I assume Britain must have those as well?
