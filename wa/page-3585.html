<p></p>also,  pulling this in here since the edit got lost in the last page.
<p></p>@Ahra: Ah,  right,  I've clearly not been describing this right. Again,  the asexual person still derives pleasure from this. It is an activity they can still enjoy. They just lack a sex drive.
<p></p>It's like playing jenga,  or something. One partner really enjoys it,  the other doesn't really care. they can still play it together,  and the partner that doesn't care can still enjoy themselves,  but they'll never sit up and think "I want to play jenga" in the way that the other partner will.

            I think it's that if you're attracted to one,  you can imagine being attracted to the other. I'm attracted to both,  so only being attracted to one simply doesn't register with me. I don't know what it's like to <em>not</em> be attracted to something. Well,  something human at least.

            I find asexuality baffling because one the basest instincts is the need to procreate,  and if something that requires sexual reproduction is not attracted to ANYTHING in that way,  then something is fundamentally wrong with them somehow.

What an asexual person lacks is a sex drive. They don't feel the impetus to have sex in the way that sexual people do - no biological urge to reproduce,  thus no sexual frustration. The body is still wired to release dopamine on orgasm,  and orgasms are still entirely possible. They just lack the desire to have it. </div>

<p></p>No,  I understand that. I'm pretty sure I'm asexual myself,  though with the way people on this forum throw the word around I am generally hesitant to say so. I meant that the relationship itself sounded emotionally abusive with the girl not thinking about what the guy wanted and treating him as a toy. Again,  that's the only example that I know of an asexual/sexual person relationship. The sexual person demanding sex thing was just one more way I feel the guy was abused.
<p></p>^ Why? It means you don't want sex. It doesn't mean anything to you.

            @ginger: I mean if you had left it at,  "I don't like it because it's weird to me",  the nit's a bit hypocritical because that's essentially the reason that homophobes don't like homo/bisexuality. The way you worded it sounds like you had an actual issue with asexuality. The bit at the end there simply clarifies that it isn't that you don't like it so much as you can't imagine it,  which is understandable.

            Asexuality scares me because I feel threatened by it. I'm fascinated by the idea of losing control (yet I would never want to do so myself,  hence why I don't get drunk) and the idea that there are people out there who don't have a sex drive that influences their decisions terrifies me.
<p></p>Again,  I'm scared of the concept,  not the people. I hate murder,  yet would gladly become friends with a murderer

            Asexual people are clearly Nietzsche's superman. Unbound by the desire to hit on the hot girl that's way out of their league.

            @Arha: Having no sex drive sounds like a legitimately good thing,  to me personally.  Sexual longing causes a shitload of angst and problems.

            @Arha: huh... okay,  I guess I can see where you're coming from there. I had just sort of thought of it where (given the Tavi/Vinyl situation) Vinyl would be the one who normally propositions it ("Hey Tavi,  wanna boink"),  and Tavi agrees because she enjoys it,  ("Yeah,  sure"),  but would never really proposition herself,  unless she think it'll make Vinyl feel better ("You need to relax... Why don't we get more comfortable?"). Vinyl would still respect Tavi's feelings on it,  obviously - there's just going to be times when one party doesn't feel like it and <em>any</em> healthy relationship is going to understand that.
<p></p>I can see a situation where it's abusive,  you're right,  but in a situation where the asexual willingly engages in sex despite lack of drive because they know it makes their partner happy,  and still enjoys it themselves,  seems romantic to me.
