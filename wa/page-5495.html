            @ Chad,  sounds like me on every single test i've ever taken,  except the ORSE ones,  those I "prepared" for the same way every single other person in the department did,  send some nub that just got there and isn't excected to do good in to take the test first and tell us waht all the questions are so we can look up the right answer.
<p></p>Or just wait till someone in RT "accidentally" leaves an answer sheet lying out. ( And HEY it was legitimate,  those test did NOT grade on if you understood the question and your information was correct,  they graded on how close your answer matched,  word for word,  the answer sheet,  regardless of whether what you wrote was just as accurate but worded differently.)

            <em>Calculus (Latin,  calculus,  a small stone used for counting) is a branch of mathematics focused on limits,  functions,  derivatives,  integrals,  and infinite series. This subject constitutes a major part of modern mathematics education. It has two major branches,  differential calculus and integral calculus,  which are related by the fundamental theorem of calculus. Calculus is the study of change, [1] in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of operations and their application to solving equations. A course in calculus is a gateway to other,  more advanced courses in mathematics devoted to the study of functions and limits,  broadly called mathematical analysis. Calculus has widespread applications in science,  economics,  and engineering and can solve many problems for which algebra alone is insufficient.</em>

            i HATED English,  of course I also have a severe mental block with opeing up to people (it's gotten better) which made it almost impossible for me to write anything opinion basd,  which was most of the essay's,  ll i could say was,  "I liked it" or "I didn't like it" I would drive myself into a panic attack trying to make myself explain any detailed feelings.
<p></p>Every other class......I'm probably the only person in that school ever that every SINGLE teacher (at least the main course ones,  not the fun elective ones) repeatedly told to STOP paying attention in class. Still aced every test.....C average though becuase I never did any homework.

            Oh that stuff,  yeah I've done that,  we just never called it Calculus. We just call it Core Maths. I think.

            @storyyeller: First class to have a failing grade,  ever! Spanish in high school was bad,  but I could manage a C-B average. In Calc II,  my college requires a 72% or higher grade to pass (at least to get to Calc III anyway). Around November (my semester ends at December),  I learned I had a mid to high D,  and it never improved. This... to say it broke me is an understatement.
<p></p>Thankfully,  I passed. I have no clue how that happened,  but I passes with a C.

            I took one semester of calculus and after the first week I had no idea what was going on.  Only time I was ever in danger of failing something.  I have no clue how I passed that class.  I'm way better at...anything else.
<p></p>@Seraphem: I love that kinda crap *coughreviewscough*.  What I always hated was having to organize everything according to an uber-strict form that would lose you points if you deviated it from any way.
