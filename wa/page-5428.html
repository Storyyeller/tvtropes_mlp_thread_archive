            @Ilse: Thanks.  Comments like that are how I keep myself motivated to write stuff like this.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">  And yeah,  a year or two ago I doubt I would have been able to churn this stuff out like this.  5 years of "read stuff and write summaries/analysis of it" gave me a lot of practice. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>I will say that the more of it you do,  the easier it gets.  And I also have to admit that the "organization" aspect of my reviews is very much determined by the scene-by-scene of the episode,  so I don't have to figure out how to organize it on my own.  I'm actually also trying to write a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkywardSword" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkywardSword">Skyward Sword</a> review,  but it's going quite slow because of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitCreatorDisorder" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitCreatorDisorder">Attention Deficit Creator Disorder</a> and also because I have to figure out how to organize the thing.  Reviewing a videogame is a lot different.

            Mousa,  I can't believe I never told you this,  but I love the way you draw faces. They're always so expressive and you have a very different style that I just love. It reminds me a little of Christopher Hart's style when he draws cartoons. (That guy is really good at copying other styles btw)
<p></p>I think the thing you need to work on right now is posing,  anatomy,  and proportions. But I love your style. I really liked your drawing,  you just need to clean it up a little ^^
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> That is exactly why I have a love-hate relationship with college. It's teaching me how to write,  which is awesome,  but I hate the actual process of learning XD

            Some aspects of learning suck,  but you got to admit,  picking up new skills or level-grinding your favorite skills to new levels is always great.

            I know some of you guys dislike the Ponibooru comments,  but I find them frequently entertaining. Example,  Some troll posted a picture saying  "I f*ucking hate Fluttershy,  What are you going to do about it B*cthes?". Comment response? <a class="urllink" href="http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/155378">Dance party<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. So they contain a few trolls,  the comedic hive-mind there makes up for it.
<p></p>They are better that the youtube comments,  anyway.

            This is kind of random,  but I always wonder why Twilight always wears purple sweater vests and why Fluttershy wears big yellow sweaters in humanizations. Talk about a limited wardrobe. The others don't seem to suffer from this phenomenon either... ><

            @Ilse: Tell me about it.  Most of my time in school has been "Ugh,  this sucks but five years down the road it's going to come in handy".  It's also how I feel about drawing; I really want to learn how to draw better but I don't have a whole lot of time for it,  and it's hard to motivate myself past the "everyone has 1000 crappy drawings that you have to get out" stage.

            @Ilse: My guess would be that sweater-vests are linked to nerds and academically-minded people - plus they allow for a collared shirt <em>and</em> purple on the upper body.  As for why Fluttershy gets sweaters... my guess would be that A) sweaters are warm and huggy and B) <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweaterGirl" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweaterGirl">Sweater Girl</a>.

            Okay,  reading those ponibooru comments was hilarious. I actually got a few tears from my eyes just from laughing so hard.
<p></p>And yeah,  I kind of understand,  but I would like to see more variety. Although it might just be me who thinks that A) Twilight,  as a college student and due to her personality,  cares very little about what she wears and B) Fluttershy spends a lot of time outside- if she wore a sweater,  she would be sweating buckets. It's just my practical side showing... &gt;&lt;

            The problem is that it seems like there's no way to become good at everything. So if I try to draw 10000 things or whatever,  that means that I'm sacrificing other stuff.

            Hi everyone,  time to derail the thread to focus on me and my thoughts on the episode.
<p></p>The plot wasn't that interesting to me,  but this episode had great animation. I liked the old-timey film bit and the training montage. Also,  something about the waterspout scene looked a lot different than the normal animation,  but in a good way.
<p></p>Anyway,  what are you guys discussing?

            Also,  swaeters tend to be a shy person outfit,  something to cover themselves with. I should know,  that's why I always wear jackets,  sweaters,  and long sleeved things and lament Summer's arrival.
<p></p>And while Twilight is college student-esque,  she's so neat and properly organized that if she didn't have a uniform she'd make sure she had one.
<p></p>@Ilse,  I think he's a hack that uses lazy anime esque art to cash in on poor kids that are obsessed with t3h animus. The very concept of "How to draw manga" and all other similar books are a joke.

            Yeah,  I think it's one of those things where when you have to make the decision of what to spend the time on,  you gravitate towards stuff that interests you or that you're naturally good at.  I've always been a decent-to-good writer and analyst,  so when I have to choose between writing and drawing,  I usually go with writing because I can churn out more and better material in the same amount of time.  As well as improve faster.
