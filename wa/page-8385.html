            Well,  yeah. It's part of why I think she's really in character. Everything sounds like something she'd say.
<p></p>I always find that Rainbow is probably the hardest one to put a speech pattern too. I think it took the author a few chapters to get it down right,  but she reads pretty good now too.
<p></p>Oh,  here's a headscratcher: (I just remembered that this bugged me when I read the chapter)
<p></p>Twi mentions that she can't turn rocks and dirt into food with transfiguration (at least not without the food itself being MADE of dirt and rocks.
<p></p>IN FPK SHE TURNED A ROCK INTO A TOP HAT!

            Well,  crap. My brother told my friend that we were both bronies. I didn't wish for him to know,  at least without knowing what the show was first. As I expected,  he mocked us alot. I should stress that its not serious mocking mind you,  he doesn't actually think it's bad I watch it,  just weird,  which is fair enough. Now though,  I wish to find a way to convince him that the show is actually good. I don't need him to become a brony himself,  I just want to show him why I watch it. Any tips?

            Well,  with the top hat,  it only stayed in top hat form while she was focused on it,  so it was kind of a temporary Transmogrification spell,  more like illusion magic. One would think that to permanently change it so that the rock you turned into an apple <em>stays</em> an apple,  requires a bit more effort or is actually impossible.
<p></p>Just my two cents.

            Her dialogue in that scene seemed to imply that she wasn't finished with the spell before becoming distracted. So I figured that once she was done,  the clothes would've stayed like that permanently
<p></p>... I don't know,  even if that wasn't the case it still bugs me that the top hat thing (and turning LEAVES INTO A SUIT) wasn't at least mentioned

            Well,  then it might like Swas said,  and it's more <em>what</em> she turned it into. Maybe top hats and coats are a-okay,  but food isn't?

            Random question:  Is there anyone in this thread well-versed in Perl?
<p></p>As for the top hat... weirdly it seemed like the spell required <em>Spike</em> to focus too.  Why would that be the case?

            On the other hand,  a transmogrification spell that <em>only</em> works as long as you're focused would be kind of useless.
<p></p>I mean suppose Spike were dancing with Rarity in that hat.  Surely he'd lose his concentration and suddenly have a rock on his head.
<p></p>And... what about those mustaches Twilight made in <em>Boast Busters?</em>

            Within the show? Yeah,  they're a little... odd,  sometimes. Sometimes magic can do all sorts of stuff,  other times it's pretty awkward.
<p></p>I think the author of CRISIS just said "hell with it" and at least tried to keep magic within his own verse consistent.

            They have? I don't think they've ever tried to give magic a definite system of rules...
<p></p>And maybe it's like science. Different rules apply to different branches of magic

            Well to be fair,  the show never tells us what magic can and cannot do,  so as far as we know there <em>are</em> no limits. Starlight Shadow certainly seems to operate under that pretense.
