<p></p>I will note however that the Dog High Command are apparently phenomenally stupid. Did they just...not have inconspicuous agents? Were they <em>actively trying to fail</em>?

            Sonic Underground seems probably the worst for Disney to try and profit from,  since it is the most obscure of all four cartoons and has almost zero connections to the games themselves (outside being the first to include Knuckles for a couple odd episodes).
<p></p>Leave for a few hours and I get thirty plus pages go past. Digging up an old topic,  shame they didn't use that AJ bit for Mmmmystery,  especially since it's one of those instances where she is a background pony while everyone gets at least a tiny moment in the spotlight. This subdues my belief that writers might be losing interest in her a little however.
<p></p>Anyone think <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar">AJ</a> would work great in a cover up plot,  like the others trying to keep her quiet about some dark secret?

            Sorry for backtracking the discussion,  I was distracted,  but I wanted to concur with Bluespade on Brave which I just saw this morning,  it was pretty nice,  and I agree,  the Trailers said nothing. I swear I went in with one thought and got something completely different coming out.
<p></p>I mean to be honest the trailer accurately depicts the beginning and showing maybe 1 or two clips of the middle and nigh end.

Really? I think that's the only major complaint I have about Brave. I was able to predict what was going to happen relatively near the start. The lack of spoilers in the trailers is definitely right,  though. <br> <br>@ponytrolls. I disagree with you. All of them look creepy. They are way too detailed in my opinion.
