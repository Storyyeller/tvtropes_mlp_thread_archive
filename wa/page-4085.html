            There are guidelines out there,  MPAA being one of them,  that define judgement of content suitability for minors.  Im pretty sure If I was found to be showing pony porn to a 13 year old reguardless of their maturity level I'd be in trouble.
<p></p>My personal guideline would be if Disney wouldnt put it in a movie (barring the hidden stuff their animators like to sneak in) then maybe you should put a warning.
<p></p>I have no problem with pony porn myself.. I look at it from time to time... but I do use the boards from work and would be in a bit of a pickle if someone saw me looking at that pic here.

            It's not porn,  and it shouldn't be treated as though the picture itself is NSFW,  but the concept (horns are phallic and are sensitive to sexual pleasure) is an 'adult' one and should have been mentioned,  is my final contribution to the topic. =)

            @Ginger: Basically,  the objection seems to be that that image is quite obviously supposed to resemble fellatio,  which is obviously NSFW and merits a warning.  Yeah,  that's not what the image actually is,  but it's similar enough that it's questionable.  It isn't pornographic,  but it's sexual enough to be NSFW.

            But that then raises the question of just what does and does not. unless you can provided quantifiable points at which it becomes necessary,  you can't really fault someone for knot being aware of where the variable points cross into realms a specific person would need a warning for.
<p></p>regardless of the image in question,  if Ginger is operating by a set quantifiable guide of any picture given the "questionable" tag being given a NSFW warning,  and then posts a pic that did not have said tag,  how is he to know there were unspoken variable that exist only in a persons mind that would require a NSFW warning.
<p></p>And yes my right brain is pretty much completely useless.

            I guess another reason I'm even more prudish then usual when it comes to ponies is the fact that I'm very not a furry,  and so a lot of it is very <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a> inducing for me. It's the same reason that I don't like humanizations. I don't <em>want</em> to be sexually attracted to these characters,  because regardless of their form,  it's still the same character to me,  and that brings it all back to square one for me.
<p></p>Not that I have problems with anyone who does like that kind of stuff,  it's just that it makes me very uncomfortable on a personal level.

            Whether or not it's marked as Questionable is a decent guideline,  but the fact that that picture wasn't marked as questionable is,  to me,  pretty good evidence that it isn't 100% reliable. Other standards for common sense need to enter into it.
<p></p>In the future,  can you just,  I dunno,  warn if the picture is sexual?

            Also,  it's the fact that no one has really complained about the NSFW pics that I've posted (Syd seemed to like a lot of them even) so I didn't get why he would suddenly be mad at this one <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">

            @Seraphem: Except for the fact that 1. It's pretty blatantly something sexual.  2.  By that argument we could post porn if somebody forgot to add an "explicit" tag.  Basically,  I'm just saying that he should err on the side of caution,  because there are people who don't want to see the ponies in a sexual contact,  and that should be respected.
<p></p>@Applelight: Goodnight.

            Okay,  finally watching the episode. I like Cranky,  and I'm glad that Pinkie was actually told that she needed to leave Cranky alone after she ruined his scrapbook. I actually like the way Cranky looks without his toupee,  too. He just needs the little mohawk that real donkeys have. Plus,  also glad that Pinkie was able to learn that not everyone likes her normal brand of friendship.
<p></p>All in all,  I think it was a pretty good episode ^^ Although one commenter on the Youtube video I'm watching brings up an interesting point:
<p></p><ul><li> Cancer pony in Read It and Weep
<p></p></li><li> Funeral in Hearts and Hooves Day
<p></p></li><li> Suddenly empty house in Ponyville this episode.
</li></ul><p></p>Sensing a subplot here...
