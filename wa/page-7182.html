            But when you write a story,  you don't get the same feeling of wonder and amazement,  because you're fully aware of the story's inner machinations. You can't enjoy it as an outsider (I can't at least)
<p></p>It's much the same with the movies I edit in college

It started as a "What if" and grew from there via the ever-present "but that would mean." I have already felt the sense of wonder by imagining the various scenes,  and now I'm getting a new sense of wonder by trying to fit it all together and re-imagining the scenes as they change because of how it all comes together to become one whole. I don't completely understand the story I'm telling,  and so I can still enjoy it.

            @ Story,  well that place is so far out of the way and the stuff in it is so junky,  no pony bothered to do anything. plus,  yeah Pinkie Belle...so sad.
<p></p>@ Ginger,  I understand,  have you tried any of the shorter side stores? There's also Pink Eyes,  granted the writing is pretty subpar,  but it's if anything even more idealisitc then FOE. Plus Puppysmiles is just so annoyingly adorable. yeah probably not for you. And every thing I've heard makes it sound like the author is just goin WAY to far on the Break Them ride for my tastes.
<p></p>and it was more the characters I loved in FOE,  setting was great,  but it was Lil'pip and her friends that really pulled me in.

            @Seraph Exactly. Through my anticipation for Red Eye I came to love the characters,  and through my love for the characters I came to love the setting itself...
<p></p>I just wish I could say the same for Project...

            After I read stories if I like the world they were in I make stories up in my head.  I have to say thats how I got through most of High school... in my head stories... they were so much nicer than the assholes that I had to deal with on a day to day basis.

            @ Orion FOE really is,  it shows that even in the worst of cicumstances,  what kinda loving creatures ponies can be,  and how the deeper the darkness pushes around you,  the brighter then light of hope seems. Yeah ponies made some mistakes,  but almost all of them were made with only good in mind,  they just got out of hoof and ended up doing worse then they intesned. But even in the failures of the past,  those ponies made sure to plant the seeds that would florish and regrow Equestria anew.

            you cover your face with your wing,  and yes but they are also tipped with pretty sharp talons,  not something you want to make a habit of slamming into your face.

            Yea but in FOE most of the Gryphons have wing blades too... so I dont know if you'd want to flip that into your face either.
