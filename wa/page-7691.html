            So far I think she's only controlled her own blood. But since her powers increase depending on how scared people are of her so if she generates enough fear she might be able to blood bend.

            More Fallout Equestria stuff? Sounds like they give them some awfully strange powers there...
<p></p>Ooh,  speaking of strange I had an awfully weird pony dream last night. In it,  Rarity was a hairdresser(Or at least,  the whole thing took place in a hair salon) who was trying desperately to be a socialite. Ponies would come over to her salon for... some reason or another,  something she had or did. As it happened though,  none of them actually liked <em>her</em> at all. When that became apparent... she would kidnap the pony who was revealed not to have liked her,  chopped them up,  and stitched them back together as a permanent friend.
<p></p>I was apparently a criminal investigator or something,  and I stumbled across a recently mutilated corpse while investigating her salon.
<p></p>Oh,  also Rarity was apparently secretly a man,  for some reason?

            @Pannic: Buh? Surely there's a source for it <em>somewhere</em>?
<p></p>I was all set to get up early and watch the stream,  but then my roommate woke me up two hours after I went to bed and I couldn't get to sleep for like,  three more hours,  so I had to turn off my alarm lest I die...

            @Pannic Maybe. But Silvertongue doesn't seem like the type of guy to give em equipment if it serves no purpose.
<p></p>And if she was manipulating sparks when she could've been generating fire all on her own,  then no wonder she got the lowest score of the Mean 6 (rolls eyes)

            I dunno much about streams. With MLP they go up on Youtube almost immediately,  but with Korra I've been relying on Nick's streaming stuff.

            <div class="quoteblock">Ooh,  speaking of strange I had an awfully weird pony dream last night. In it,  Rarity was a hairdresser(Or at least,  the whole thing took place in a hair salon) who was trying desperately to be a socialite.</div>
<p></p>Sounds like a typical Pony episode so far...
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Ponies would come over to her salon for... some reason or another,  something she had or did. As it happened though,  none of them actually liked her at all. When that became apparent... she would kidnap the pony who was revealed not to have liked her,  chopped them up,  and stitched them back together as a permanent friend.
<p></p>I was apparently a criminal investigator or something,  and I stumbled across a recently mutilated corpse while investigating her salon.
<p></p>Oh,  also Rarity was apparently secretly a man,  for some reason? </div>
<p></p>So it was like a mash-up of "Sweet and Elite, " "Cupcakes" and the twist ending of "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"?
