            @Ginger
<p></p>I think you would like a lot of things. The problem is that your tastes are so narrow that even with shows/books/whatever that would fit your criteria,  you can't stand to read/watch/play past the first few episodes/chapters/levels thanks to normal storytelling conventions.  Most stories take their time in establishing the villains/threats because A: if you bring out the big guns right off the bat,  then there's no room for the hero to grow,  and B: the story needs time to establish the characters/setting before the villain rips it all to shreds. It's just the way that stories work,  and you seem to be completely incompatible with them. Just how many times have you said "I'm just trying to get to Part X,  where Villain Y shows up, " because the rest of the story is worthless to you? I don't exactly know what to tell you to try and get over that,  but I think you'd enjoy a lot more things if you went into it trying to just enjoy yourself with no specific goal in mind rather than going into it to find a villain.

            @Chrysalis:  Alright,  in that case you'd better watch out for strong gusts of wind.
<p></p>@Ginger:  If you're interested in Cowboy Beebop,  you might want to try the movie first.  The main villain in the series doesn't really appear that often.

            @Lurker I need an anchor. Something to force me through the bits I might not like.
<p></p>I read Fallout Equestria,  anticipating Red Eye the whole way through,  and through my anticipation,  I enjoyed the rest of the story.
<p></p>ASOIAF. I enjoyed the story,  but it was my anticipation towards seeing Tywin Lannister that kept me reading.
<p></p>Avatar. I enjoyed the characters and the story,  but it was my anticipation towards seeing Azula that kept me watching.
<p></p>Are you noticing a pattern here?

            I'd say that both the movie's villain and the main villain of Cowboy Bebop are pretty competent. And the main charector is not powerful or invinceable,  in fact,  he get's his ass handed to him quite a few times in the show,  but he manages to still be badass without being ridiculously "Awesome" or something like that.

            Yeah,  the main cast of Bebop struggles pretty much the whole way through; even when they win they <em>really</em> have to fight for it.  As for villains,  not sure.  A lot of them only show up for one or two episodes.  The <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>'s villain is pretty cool,  but he doesn't show up incredibly often.

            I dont think Ginger would be able to watch Cowboy Bebop... AFAIK there is no real recurring villian other than Vicious and he's only in a handful of episodes and I dont think he really does any masterminding or anything... he's just there to be a foil.   Its been some time since I watched it though.

            Well,  I think Vicious did pull off a pretty brillaint plan in the last two episodes,  but I don't want to give away what it was.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>And like JT said,  the main charectors really,  REALLY have to work hard in most if not all the episodes,  so their's no <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringInvinceableHero" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringInvinceableHero">Boring invinceable hero</a> or anything like that.

<p></p>MLP anime. With transformation sequences whenever they use the Elements. And a hot springs episode.

<p></p>Maybe they use some sort of electronic ink display. It wouldn't be capable of very high quality or refresh rate,  but it could handle early 80's style games.
