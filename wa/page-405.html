            I'd assume Trixie's talent is magic as well.

        <div class="post-content">
            <div class="quoteblock"> On the whole it seems likely that Trixie was at one point the bottom half of a rivalry - with a very,  very nasty rival. </div>
If Trixie returns,  they should reveal who that rival was.  Who wants to make the first wild guess?
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> I've noticed a Wing Boner in at least one other thing (Toy Story 2),  can anyone else think of anymore examples so that I can decide whether or not to <a class="discussionlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/yk_activity.php?interval=.25">YKTTW</a> it. </div>
<div class="quoteblock"> Hm... it seems like an odd offspring-trope of Something Else Also Rises and Fantastic Arousal,  but for the most part,  it seems like wingboners are already covered under the latter trope. </div>
Is this even used like that in the show,  or is it just a fan in-joke about how the animators will raise someone's wings just because it looks better in a certain shot regardless of whether that character needs to use them?
<p></p>My other thought about the pegasi is that perhaps magic also = cartoon physics,  and so they can turn rainbows into aerial paint and clouds into hunks of stiff cotton because it's easy enough to see them that way.  I think this explains Princess Celestia's power: The sun may be like a real star normally,  but she can easily <em>imagine</em> the sun being a little white disc in the lower atmosphere,  so that's how heavy it is for her to lift it.  I only hope next season features pegasi doing more absurd things like ripping the silver linings off clouds to turn into coins and jewelry and such.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Strictly speaking,  Rarity uses more than simple telekinesis. I mean,  when she puts those decorations on her dresses,  those gems/sequins/what-have-yous don't exactly attach by themselves. And she attached her tail (or what used to be her tail) to Steven's sliced-off mustache. </div>
Right,  and there was that time she re-attached the tree branch,  so I believe Rarity's main magic specialty is <em>attaching things</em>.  I wonder when that will come in handy again...
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> To me,  Twilight is the most attractive by far. It's her eyes,  and her Hime Cut. And her voice. </div>
I just like how Twilight stands out with her pretty shade of purple,  plus she's the best at showing off how the sophisticated computer animation distorts the cutie marks to make them look as if they're really attached to the ponies' hides: Watch her big star stretch back and forth as she trots.  I also appreciate that Twilight's the smart,  mellow one without being boring or resorting to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpockSpeak" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpockSpeak">Spock Speak</a> to prove it.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Fluttershy is very appeasing and nice to be around,  but she's kind of boring. </div>
Now the way I see it,  Fluttershy <em>can</em> be fun,  but she needs a more energetic pony like Pinkie Pie to draw her out of her shell first.  (Although "Griffon the Brush-Off" gave me the impression that Pinkie Pie condescends to Fluttershy a little too much.)  Alternatively,  one can make her so mad that she stops being herself,  but I don't like that.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> As for Apple,  I really really don't go for the Huckleberry Ann look.I just don't find it my heart to be attractive. Too many bad cultural associations... </div>
Yeah,  maybe she does go overboard with the whole "cowgirl" archetype,  but on the bright side,  I'm starting to think that Applejack has the cutest straight-on face of the bunch!  She does have some fierce competition there from Rainbow Dash as usual though...
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Trixie has a crescent moon if I recall correctly and she certainly has more than a single spell which Twilight says most Unicorns have. </div>
Nah,  I was fooled into thinking it was a moon and star too,  but then I read someone point out that it's actually a star-tipped wand with a curving sparkle trail.  It's just hard to see the stick part.  The funny thing about Trixie's cutie mark to me was that it did turn out to be something nice and magic-related when the episode kept it from being revealed for so long,  even after she took off the cloak,  so I had been expecting it to be something embarrassing.  Then again,  I read of other viewers who expected Trixie's hat to hide the secret that she wasn't a unicorn at all!

There's also the time she transformed a full third (or half? Fourth?) of a tree into mini-topiaries.
<p></p>I think her magic specialty is,  in a word,  <em>crafting</em>.

Obvious choices of course,  but I have a fascination for that kind of glamour and envy for that kind of demure beauty,  respectively. Applejack is also adorable in her own way.
<p></p>I'm too much like Pinkie for my own good,  right down to hair that refuses to stay straight (notwithstanding the Party of One freakout)

            I thought we were ranking based on how the other ponies in the show seem to react to them?  If doing personal takes on their looks... Twilight leads everyone else a bit for me (I really like her hairstyle for some reason I'm not 100% sure of),  but otherwise I can't really decide,  especially since they're all drawn to look adorable.
<p></p>On a side note,  I've been rewatching the season and has anyone else noticed that there's actually quite a few scenes where Fluttershy looks like she's getting pretty mad,  but doesn't say a single word?

            Huh,  I'll have to look out for that if I ever decide to watch an episode again.  I think this is one of those shows where the voice acting can distract you from all the neat little touches in the animation like side character expressions.

            My theory about magical ability is that it is mainly determined by practice and effort.
<p></p>Most unicorns are interested in a particular hobby or profession,  so they learn things that relate to their interests. Twilight and Trixie are interested in magical in general,  so their abilities are much more varied.

<p></p>It's a fan in-joke,  but it's no real stretch to see how a pegasus' wings unfolding means she's excited - <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKnowWhatIMean" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKnowWhatIMean">in one of several ways</a>.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">My other thought about the pegasi is that perhaps magic also = cartoon physics,  and so they can turn rainbows into aerial paint and clouds into hunks of stiff cotton because it's easy enough to see them that way. I think this explains Princess Celestia's power: The sun may be like a real star normally,  but she can easily imagine the sun being a little white disc in the lower atmosphere,  so that's how heavy it is for her to lift it. <a class="urllink" href="../wa/page-405.html#post-10102">-Magic Food<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></div>
<p></p>I'm not sure that's true.  I don't know about the rainbows (man,  screw physics),  but the way it seems to me is that the pegasi have some sort of tactile telekinesis (they can pull carts and gigantic moving vans no problem,  after all,  with no other pegasus  holding the back end) that also makes clouds solid for them.  It's explicitly a pegsus ability and can be copied via magic,  so I don't think it's just imagination.

            <div class="quoteblock">BTW,  for some reason I feel that the various pony breeds would work very well in a bog-standard fantasy RPG as balanced "races",  and unicorn magic is part of this.</div>
Gonna have to disagree with you there. Unicorns are waaaay overpowered. If (God forbid) there was a war in Equestria,  unicorns would curbstomp the other two races until Celestia intervened.
<p></p>Earth ponies are the best at growing things; that translates into the best industrial capacity of the pony breeds.  But without any defensive capability beyond kicking people really hard,  their only way to survive would be to ally with one of the other sides and rely on them to keep the farms from burning down.
<p></p>Pegasi would probably make a name for themselves; air power is a huge advantage in combat.  But with telekinesis,  unicorns could block/deflect any dropped projectiles,  and we simply have no idea as to the limit of their offensive capabilities.  As a sample,  though,  Twilight was able to <em>mass-brainwash</em> a town full of parasprites to change their intended diet,  and that took just a few seconds. Granted,  Twilight is an unusually powerful unicorn,  but I doubt she's totally unique in her talent for magic.  Unicorns can sense the location of things they can't see.  Unicorns can fire energy beams out of their horns. Unicorns can use <em>tools</em>. In almost any conflict,  brief or sustained,  I'd bet heavily on unicorn power.
<p></p>Although...I'm curious as to the degree of control pegasi have over the weather.  If they can accurately target lightning bolts,  that degree of raw power might give the unicorns a run for their money. Once the unicorns construct lightning rods,  however,  that ability is largely negated.
<p></p>To be sure,  all of the races will be best off cooperating; the other races will eventually starve without the food the Earth Ponies provide,  and using pegasus transportation to deliver a unicorn to the right spot could turn the tide of a battle.  Somebody needs to get to work on a strategy game so we can simulate battles between pony nations!

I'd like to see one for Trixie too,  I personally reckon she suffered some kind of horrific trauma in her childhood. It would justify that ego of hers. Gilda already has a bond with a mane cast member which can be used to redeem her.
