            Mare-do-well is more of a mediocre episode to me then anything else. I mean the comic book refrences were great and all,  and I did like Sparkler's scene,  but RD did develop an Ego way too quickly. I don't even know how I feel about what the other mane 5 did in that episode,  so I can't really get in a debate over that.
<p></p>Who here thinks that only times Pinkie was annoying were in "The Last round-up" {Though at least she was also funny in that episode,  and her being annoying was intentional} and "A friend in deed"? Because other then those two episodes,  I freaking love her {In the non-creepy way mind you <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">}.

<p></p>I think the episode took place over several months. You don't get disasters every day anyway.

<p></p>@Marston: There are a few individual instances in other episodes,  but A Friend in Deed was the one where I really thought she was annoying.  In The Last Roundup I wasn't so much annoyed by her as the fact that her friends had no qualms about basically weaponizing her to annoy AJ into submission.
<p></p>@Story: That's probably true,  but the episode gives no real frame of reference and it ends up looking like they all happen in quick succession.

            So finally found where you ponies have been messing with the cross-dimensional barriers,  those things exist for a reason you know. Do you have any idea the headaches I've been getting trying to patch all the chinks or preventing total universal implosion? The pink one is bad enough on her own. And I get the feeling I have her to think for this as well. Well could be worse,  at least it's just information,  no physical breaches,  though could you all on the human side tell your Sethisto to either stop trying,  or not begin trying,  to create a bridge,  i've fixed enough holes some version of him has caused.
<p></p>....Doctor? What are you doing here? And please tell me your smart enough no to try crashing back through the Void yet,  I don't think it's stable enough even for me to open a portal,  and mine are a lot less damaging then yours.

            Bah you interdimensional gate keepers have no sense of humor. Besides most people agree that crossing the barrier is nigh impossible with anything short of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> powers.

            Besides if the barrier was at such risk then Tumblr would have been declared a Keter-Level point of risk by the Earth SCP Foundation a long time ago.
<p></p>Speaking of SCP I always find it funny how they overlook the doctor. Something about him not being threatening enough and impossibly hard to catch I guess. They do have a tendency to overlook things that don't murder people just by being looked at.

            @ Steve,  i'm not even supposed to be any sort of gatekeeper,  but between the humans and the ponies in your two 'veses seems all i've been doing last year or so is closing one breach after another,  or giving a lecture on the finer points on how NOT to trigger a demensional merger to certain princesses that think they know all about demensional travel,  despite this being there first attempt at it.
<p></p>It's gotten so bad i'm afraid to open my own portal out of this oververse,  though at least if i have to be stuck somewhere,  this is a nice one,  the amount of Shannara here is staggering,  and as long as i'm paying this much attention for tears,  no Shadowen should be able to sneak in.
<p></p>@ Doctor,  me personally no,  but you do know one of my counterparts,  he handles the more sciency 'verses,  I handle the more magical ones,  he's changed his title a lot so not sure what one you know him at in your personal time steam (hey you try coming up with at least seven seperte designnations that all sound cool for a group of people that are all demensional counterparts to each other.) I've seen what you consider safe...at least let me check the TARDIS' readings before you try it ok?
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> Oh the barriers them selves aren't really that bad,  there just weak becuase these two 'verses are becoming so harmonized,  it makes it much easier to cross. Information exchange is fine,  it's when somepony or someone tries to make a physical bridge that things can go very VERY wrong if it's not done exactly right. And the better the 'verses harmonize,  the easier it is for some amateur to open a tear just right to give both space-time continuum's a massive wedgie..most likely resulting in them both flowing together into one universe with enough force to trigger a new big Bang and start a new universe fresh.

            I'm not sure what to think about her in Luna Eclipsed.  Yeah,  she caused all sorts of problems for Luna,  but on the other hand given Luna's entrance it wouldn't be weird if Pinkie just assumed that Luna was deliberately being scary and acted accordingly.
