            I know Death,  it's a stupid line from Star Trek V,  which was an absolute wreck of a movie where Kirk takes on an energy being claiming to be god and is apparently the one person in the entire film with the wherewithal to question the situation until "God" starts hurting people.  I had forgotten how awful the movie was until I saw it last night when some friends and I decided to marathon the first 6 Trek films.  Damn it,  now as awful as the fifth movie is,  I can't help but want a ponified Sybok.
<p></p>@ Ginger:  I can understand why it'd be infuriating if the fic has done that with every single major villain it's introduced.  It's okay to mislead once or twice,  but I feel that repeatedly misleading the reader and hoping it has the same impact each time is a sign of weak writing.  If you're going to give your villain sympathetic motivations,  fine.  Just don't expect that it'll have the same impact when you do it the third,  fourth,  or fifth time.

            That's the gist of what I was saying,  Ginger.  I'm absolutely fine with villains being sympathetic and even hiding that fact for a central villain or two,  but it feels as if PH tries to apply this to all of its villains.  Eventually the impact of the reason the villain is sympathetic lessens if an author keeps trying to pull the wool over the reader's eyes as to the exact motivations of his villainous characters.  I like having a sympathetic villain or two,  it adds depth to the character,  after all.

            Well,  now that ze moment has passed,  back to work. I personally believe that (STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE) Harmony is created from a balance of Chaos and Order,  instead of Chaos simply being the opposite of Harmony. Just as Discord represents a saturation of Chaos,  there must be another villain that represents the opposite. My vote's for Tirek,  since his description seems close to a corrupt king.

            I think it wouldn't be so simple as an element being either Orderly or Chaotic,  and the set averaging out to being balanced,  but more like each of the elements representing a sort of balance.
