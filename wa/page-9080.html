            About those ponibooru torrents,  does anyone know if the images are sorted at all,  or if its just one big folder?  I'm thinking of downloading it,  but that would mean spending basically an entire day sorting and deleting all the crap I don't need like the memes and screencaps and grimdark pics.

            All that's different about Derpy is the voice and the name. She will never be named in any "official" capacity,  though the voice change means that she could get a speaking part again. Before,  they had to alter the voice in post to make it sound more feminine,  and it still sounded kinda boyish. Derpy herself isn't going anywhere.

            I think the change of Derpy in Last Roundup was a kneejerk reaction and that Hasbro has since calmed down on the whole Derpy thing.  Any mention of the issue I see at this point comes from the fans,  not them.
<p></p>Also yeah,  the voice change doesn't bug me at all,  because its at least the correct gender now.

            I'm fairly sure someone said that they had to digitally alter the voice in post to make it sound more like a girl. Tabitha's original performance was probably a lot lower pitched. As it stood,  if they kept the voice as it was,  she wouldn't have been able to reproduce it without digital assistance. The fact that it was changed actually makes it <em>more</em> likely that she will speak again,  because now she has a voice that they don't have to put extra work into making.

<p></p>( Since you dont watch it,  at the end of every Voyager review he calls out the "Stupid Neelix moment" for the episode,  the dumbest thing Neelix has done,  this one time included waling into a room and handing someone a PADD without saying a line. That is you with Pinkie.)
