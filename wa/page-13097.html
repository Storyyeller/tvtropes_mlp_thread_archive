Amy Keating Rogers,  the writer for that episode,  said she never would have used the name Derpy if she had known about its meaning as a pejorative. One (or more,  I don't remember) of her children is mentally disabled.

            That's personal,  and I would understand that.
<p></p>It just irks me that a bunch of random people would get offended on another person's behalf when those people don't seem to take the same offense.

            Except it really didn't seem like a vocal minority to me,  there were at least thousands of comics,  images,  songs,  videos,  Tumblr posts etc that were Save Derpy. I don't recall ever seeing a single anti one.

            I suppose it wouldn't take much to make them change it though,  since they're probably afraid of being considered offensive.

            Badwolf,  I once heard of a tumblr user who's infamous for hating Derpy,  and is often said to have "killed Derpy". I'd mention it's name,  but that might count as drama importing.

            There were very few people who are legitmately anti-Derpy; one fairly well known fanartist (at that point; she's not so big in the fandom anymore probably due to this) comes to mind.  Basically a few people complained that Derpy was an "ableist" stereotype,  and Hasbro decided "better safe than sorry" and changed the scene she was in.  A chunk of the rest of the fandom did <em>not</em> like that,  and this being the internet,  the inevitable happened.
<p></p>Her status in the show itself is doubtful,  but as said,  she's still consistently used in other official material (she gets a whole page in the comic,  and she appears on multiple covers),  and the fanart is flowing just as fast as always,  so she's not going away any time soon.

            Yeah,  the annoying thing is that in the fandom at least,  almost <em>no one</em> used the term that way.  The whole "Derp eyes" meme simply refers to silly-looking facial expressions,  and most fans used "Derpy" as more of a term of endearment than anything else.

            Afternoon everyone.
<p></p>Ugh,  that whole Derpy thing?  Man that was stupid.  Because cartoons have never had clumsy/idiotic characters before.  And yeah,  my interpretation of Derpy has always been that she's a bit clumsy,  possibly on account of her eyes,  but that she's otherwise intelligent.  The fandom generally treats her pretty well,  what with all the depictions of her being a caring mother an whatnot.

            Yeah,  NOTHING in the fandom portrays her as anything but amazing,  at most a bit <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspirationallyDisadvantaged" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspirationallyDisadvantaged">Inspirationally Disadvantaged</a>,  she's a kind,  loving,  sincere mother,  who is just a bit clumsy and scatterbrained.
<p></p>The real WTF point is,  that Derpy is some how wrong,  yet Snips and Snail are fine.

            She could easily appear again,  since she's still in the intro to every episode despite the fact that editing her out would be trivial. If I had to make a guess,  they're saving her for something special,  rather than hiding her in every episode.
