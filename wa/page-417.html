            Is there a real distinction between the two? I mean,  they come down to the same thing,  don't they? But then I suppose if they're two words in english,  why wouldn't they have two words in another language. Just out of curiosity,  what is Auntie in Spanish?

            Its because Auntie (As we already know),  is aunt,  but in a more "term of endearment" form.
<p></p>Tia just means aunt,  is the normal word without any modifications for endearment,  in fact I dont think an equivalent to Auntie exists in Spanish,  as it already denotes familiarity.
<p></p>The closest to an equivalent would be Tiíta (Note the accent in the second i) and I dont think that word actually exists.

            Yeap there isn't an equivalent of auntie in Spanish. Nobody uses that tiita as far as I am aware of.

            A Dog and Pony Show is the only episode I've actually managed to catch on TV and I don't really plan on doing it again (it required me to wake up really early and I don't exactly sleep in.  Stupid Treehouse hours).  Was worth getting up just to say I did catch one on TV,  though,  especially since I really like the episode.
<p></p>All right,  did another sketch for the poison joke theme at the DA ATG.

<p></p>I watched Over A Barrel again yesterday,  and came up with a complicated pun: In the episode,  the settlers use apple pies as weapons. We have also seen people drowning their sorrows in sweet things. The buffalo gets apple pies in the end. In other words,  the Apple-loosans end up doing what many a cliched Western villain has done: selling guns and whiskey to the Indians!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>The apple pies as weapons is freaking hilarious to me,  btw. Even if there has been plenty of real dangers in the show of someone getting hurt,  I can't help love the idea of a robber threatening someone with a pie! Or: "Look out! He has a crumpet!" Or a spy spoof where someone has leaked the secret location of the really big intercontinental muffin to... whoever you want to throw muffins at.

Yeah,  that's how I feel,  because most of the characters sound like an average person putting on a voice,  but Cathy Weseluck's voices just sound really odd to me.

            I don't see that myself. Sure,  they're kinda close for being teacher/student,  but consider that,  in a way,  Celestia might be the only other pony that Twilight really talked to before she moved to Ponyville,  and pretty much her only friend besides Spike.

            Yeah.  Pretty much everypony in Equestria is a big fan of Celestia's,  which makes sense - she's a very warm and accessible monarch - so I can only imagine the sort of respect and affection her dedicated pupil would have for her.  I actually wouldn't be surprised if Twilight did have a minor crush on her teacher when she first hit puberty.  Just because that would be adorable.

            Don't forget that the actress for Spike also voiced Trunks in DBZ.
<p></p>Remember a little while ago when Treehouse aired Party of One and censored the word loser? Well,  Boast Busters just aired and one of Trixie's lines was removed. Specificaly "When Trixie is through the only thing they'll call you is loser." How exactly is the word loser so offensive? I'm willing to bet a lot of Gilda's lines in Griffon the Brush-off are going to be censored too.

What makes this one worse is how they silenced the whole line and not just the word. At least in Party of One they didn't silence an entire comeback. Not even closed captioning helped me out on what the quote was,  it just said (no audio). I have to agree,  do they really think "loser" is that offensive? But considering Treehouse itself,  they have not a clue about what they're doing,  especially considering (I'll say it again) about how they air Friendship is Magic right after Barney and Friends on Sundays. Chances are,  by that scheduling alone,  they probably want all their programming to be squeaky clean,  but they're not even doing a good job at that. They let shows by with references to death,  having the characters say die,  but they think that saying "losers" is too far.

Nevermind the fact that in the instances that it's used the character is either insane or obviously supposed to be a jerk.

Should the group REALLY be hanging out with Pinkie Pie? I mean she's not a Cupcakes level psychopath,  but she's definitely more unhinged than the others (When the others lose it they normally have a better reason than her) Her friends were planning a SURPRISE party and she ended up like THAT.

Pinkie Pie seems to be most level-headed when her friends are there to keep her insanity in check.  She only went insane when she thought that they were abandoning her.  She'd be way worse off if she was left to her own devices.  She basically thrives on social contact; her "special talent" is makes other ponies happy,  and if she can't do that,  that's when her psychosis comes out.

So....are they saying they saying that "stupid" is ok but "losers" is too far? Anybody that watched those shows should already know that they shouldn't say those words and apply it to this show and be able to apply that "losers" is bad. But then again,  that episode was teaching not to say that word,  but <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a> didn't....well,  I just answered my own question.

            "Party of One" is the only time we've seen her get quite that depressed,  and that was because she thought her friends had abandoned her.  Given that she learned the Friendship Report that episode too,  it probably won't happen again - losing her friends is probably the only thing that would cause Pinkie to do that,  and I'd imagine that though Pinkie doesn't have the best information retention rate of the mane six,  she'll remember to trust her friends more if something like that happens again.

<p></p>That actually makes a lot of sense. Someone mentioned something about Ponies going insane if they fail at their special talents. Makes me want to see a one-shot pony who went COMPLETELY batshit because of it.
