            Because we don't have much in the way of villains and secondary characters,  so the few we do get are expanded to absurd levels.  See also,  every character who's only appeared in a background shot but has a name,  fanart and fanfiction about them.

            Hey everyone. This is unrelated to the current discussion,  but I require some advice. I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible.
<p></p>I only recently became a brony,  and a couple of weeks ago,  I finally came to terms with the fact that I was watching a “girls show” and began suggesting it my immediate friends. Now,  many friends of both genders watch it,  but there are two holdouts that are refusing to give it much of a chance,  probably on principle. One of them watched the first episode,  and,  declaring it “wasn’t for him, ” will not watch any more. Of course,  he has a right to his opinion,  but since he is judging the show based on one of its (arguably) weakest episodes,  I feel like he is missing out. Worse,  though,  is my other friend,  who won’t watch it at <em>all</em>,  almost certainly because of my first friend being rather vocal about his opinion.
<p></p>I figure I can convince at least one of them to watch one more episode,  and I feel if I can convert one,  the other will follow since the two of them pretty much always watch the same things. Anyways,  my question is what episode would you guys recommend? Right now,  I’m leaning toward Sonic Rainboom,  Dragonshy or <em>possibly</em> a Bird in the Hoof,  but since those are some of my personal favorites,  I want to make sure I’m not being blinded by my own preferences. Plus,  I’m not entirely sure how good they’d be if you don’t already understand the character dynamics (for example,  I don’t know how cool the ending to Dragonshy would be if they don’t know Fluttershy very well).
<p></p>...Aaand that turned out a <em>lot</em> less brief than I intended.

            Which is actually pretty diverse,  since most ponies can only do magic related to their talent.  I guess showing off is her talent?

            Her cutie mark is a wand and cape,  I imagine her calling in life was "Stage Performance" which naturally entails lots of features to entertain and dazzle people with,  and that includes more that light tricks. And she did do this for the most part,  it was the braggart and condensing behavior that caused her to grossly exaggerate her abilities that did her in.
<p></p>Then you have Twilight,  who represents the <em>very essence</em> of Magic and is A) Naturally gifted beyond any other,  and B) Has spent much of her life studying it and honing her skills. She has UNLIMITED POOOOOWWWWWEEEEERRRRR!!!
<p></p>There really isn't a comparison between the two except in Trixie's mind.

            <div class="quoteblock">I figure I can convince at least one of them to watch one more episode,  and I feel if I can convert one,  the other will follow since the two of them pretty much always watch the same things. Anyways,  my question is what episode would you guys recommend? Right now,  I’m leaning toward Sonic Rainboom,  Dragonshy or possibly a Bird in the Hoof,  but since those are some of my personal favorites,  I want to make sure I’m not being blinded by my own preferences. Plus,  I’m not entirely sure how good they’d be if you don’t already understand the character dynamics (for example,  I don’t know how cool the ending to Dragonshy would be if they don’t know Fluttershy very well).</div>
<p></p>To be honest,  I'm kind of dealing with a similar issue.
<p></p>Some episodes I've considered for a like situation are:
<p></p><em>Bridle Gossip</em> - Because the curses are hilarious.  But it runs into the "not as funny if you don't know the characters" problem.
<p></p><em>Swarm of the Century</em> - Again,  hilarity and its one of the less "typically girly" plots of the series.  I'd probably go with this.
<p></p><em>Green Isn't Your Color</em> - I like this episode,  and I think everyone needs to know the eternal meaning of "FOR-EVERRRR!" but my friends might feel its too preachy.
<p></p><em>Over a Barrel</em> - I think its funny,  but some of my friends have an initial bad reaction to singing and dancing (even if it <em>is</em> played for laughs).
<p></p>EDIT:  <em>Griffon the Brush-Off</em> might also be a good starter episode.

            My suggestion  for helping somepony get started with the series is to <em>not</em> start them with a full episode. Try getting them to watch either some "Best Of..." vids or a PMV (like that Epic one). Get their curiosity pegged <em>then</em> show them a full episode. That way they are at least a little more motivated than if they went in cold.

            <div class="quoteblock">Because we don't have much in the way of villains and secondary characters,  so the few we do get are expanded to absurd levels. See also,  every character who's only appeared in a background shot but has a name,  fanart and fanfiction about them.</div>
<p></p>I think some viewers want to see the main ponies fight some EVIL villains.  Nightmare Moon can be called a villain but the story went she was more like kid that threw a tantrum and got banished to the moon as a form of time out.  She seemed more like a misunderstood teenager than an evil villain.
<p></p>Still,  I do wonder if Luna's turn to darkness was something that Luna did herself or did she get a little shove or conned into that direction?  Her plan of Eternal Night seems pretty similar to a G1 villain's plan for Eternal Night.
