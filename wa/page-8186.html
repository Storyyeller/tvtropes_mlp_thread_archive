            It seems to be,  unless I'm mistaken,  that Rarity and Twilight as well as AJ and Fluttershy are the only duos that haven't really shared the spotlight in an episode before.

            If they had Rarity making up a bunch of stupid rules about things princesses "don't do, " then they could also homage the G3 story "Princess Promenade."
<p></p>@Ace: What do you mean when you said that I "got it in one?"  Do you mean in the first season or is it slang for something else?  It does sound like a potential season 3 episode,  if they do go the route of having Twilight's connection to her brother and Princess Cadance mentioned again. (I would think they would at least have a cameo,  given how much their wedding was hyped.)

<p></p><span class="blue">Twilight knows a lot of knowledge,  but knowledge is probably the least useful kind of intelligence by itself.  There are a huge number of times where the conflict of the episode has relied on Twilight spazzing out and doing something dumb,  it's a core part of her character now.  Hence why I think Rarity is actually the smartest of the 6.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">She's successful,  she's socially adept,  she's knowledgeable,  she's perceptive,  she's adaptive,  and she's fairly sensible most of the time.  Rather than her conflicts being caused by dumb choices,  they're usually based on jealously or attempting to keep other ponies in the dark about some secret,  which isn't <em>dumb, </em> really,  just not good thing to do.</span>

            @Rainbow: You summed up what I was thinking,  lol. It would interesting to see how it would play out if Rarity realizes she was just using Twi's newfound social status to elevate herself,  and tries to make amends somehow.
<p></p>@Bluespade: Twi's intelligence lies in her organising and knowledge pool. Take her out of her comfort zone and she becomes panicky and irrational.

            @crowlover: That would be funny if Rarity made that a rule,  or pretty much told Twilight to NOT do something that Celestia or Luna has already done in the show that might be considered "un-princesslike."  What if she even tried to get Twilight to talk more like Luna does with the Royal Canterlot Voice and using more formal and archaic speech? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>Given that her idea of how she would meet her prince was right out of a classic fairy tale or a romantic novel,  it would make sense for Rarity to have an idealized view of what a princess is supposed to act like.

            @Ace: Twilight probably knows speech that's even MORE archaic than how Luna speaks,  and she starts using it and completely confuses Rarity (as in,  using the Equestrian equivalent of actual Old English,  not mere "old-fashioned English").
<p></p>@crowlover: Twilight actually could turn herself into an alicorn of sorts,  if she did that spell on herself that gives a non-pegasus wings that she did on Rarity in Sonic Rainboom.

            Actually,  on second thought,  maybe the normal-wing spell lasts nowhere near as long as the butterfly-wing spell and that's why the normal-wing spell didn't come up in "Sonic Rainboom" (this being the in-universe reason—the out-of-universe reason is probably that the makers of the game came up with the normal-wing spell on their own).
