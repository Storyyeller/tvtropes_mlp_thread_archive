            God damn you guys and your tear jerkers. I'm seriously tempted to read <em>My Little Dashie</em>,  but I know for a fact that I'll end up crying if I do. (and I have a very strange relationship with Tear Jerkers,  where they'll keep me locked in an escalating spiral of depression for days on end until I forget all about the initial TJ itself.)
<p></p>One question about it (this is before reading it of course): Was Rainbow Dash ever let out of the guy's house while she was growing up? I can't imagine a talking,  Blue coated,  rainbow maned pegasus going over well in whatever town this guy's living in.

            Hey Gingerninja,  here's a happy fic for you:
<p></p><em>One day,  Applejack was walking through town.  First she went to visit Twilight,  but before she knocked she heard the unmistakable sound of girlish giggling.  Applejack couldn't help putting her ear to the door,  and this is what she heard:</em>
<p></p><em>"Pinkie Pie,  my darling..."</em>
<p></p><em>"Twilight,  are you sure it's safe?"</em>
<p></p><em>A brief pause,  then "We can wait,  if you want.  I'm in no hurry."</em>
<p></p><em>"Just... just read me a story.  Okay?"</em>
<p></p><em>"Okay..."</em>
<p></p><em>Whatever was going on in there,  sounded too adorable,  and Applejack felt it was better to leave them alone.  So she walked through town and happened to see Rarity,  around the back of a building... with a stallion.  Again Applejack was so surprised that for a moment she couldn't help but watch,  wondering if this was what she thought it was.  The kiss confirmed it.  So Applejack moved on.</em>
<p></p><em>Maybe Fluttershy was free for an evening of hanging out.  So Applejack head there.  But as she neared she saw something unexpected.  Both Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash were there... and so was Big Macintosh.  And both the girls seemed upset at him.  Applejack soon heard why.</em>
<p></p><em>"I can't!"  Rainbow Dash said.  "Fluttershy deserves you more!"</em>
<p></p><em>"No,  you do,  Rainbow Dash!"  Fluttershy countered.</em>
<p></p><em>"I can't!  I'm not a lovey-dovey pony.  I wouldn't make him happy."</em>
<p></p><em>"Yes you would!  Just try!"</em>
<p></p><em>"Ladies,  please!"  Big Macintosh said.  "I... you both are so wonderful.  I'm having a hard time choosing between the two of you.  My heart hurts,  my head is about to explode..."</em>
<p></p><em>"Oh Macintosh,  that's so romantic!"  Fluttershy rested on her forhooves.</em>
<p></p><em>"Yeah, "  so did Rainbow Dash,  "Almost brings up the girl in me."</em>
<p></p><em>Applejack turned away and sighed.  As she walked on,  all she could think was "what a depressing day.  Everypony has a lover but me.  Why?  What do they got that I ain't got?  Oh now don't you start Applejack,  ain't no use bein' jealous..."</em>
<p></p><em>All the sudden someone said "Excuse me."</em>
<p></p><em>Applejack looked,  and there was a shining white Alicorn standing beside her,  and he had the most defined features and the most romantic eyes.</em>
<p></p><em>"Miss Applejack... I... oh,  I don't know how to say this.  I've seen you around town a lot lately,  and... I'm wondering,  would you be available for dinner tonight?  At the Chateau de Seville?"</em>
<p></p><em>The alicorn turned out to be a well-off silk merchant. Applejack and the alicorn had dinner,  fell hopelessly in love and Applejack became the first of the mane six to be happily married,  and their love burned bright all the days of their life.  The end.</em>
<p></p>There,  there's a happy Applejack story for you.  Feel better?

I guess I have an odd affinity for some of them (though I'm honestly not all that interested in My Little Dashie).
<p></p>I noticed a few pages back that there was a discussion on whether Pinkie Pie was actually close to any pony or not and I just wanted to throw in my two bits.
<p></p>If Pinkie is really not that close to anypony I don't its because of any lack of effort on her part. She does seem to want to interact with and get to know other ponies better,  but there are several factors that don't work in her favor.
<p></p>For one she tends to get so overexcited that she becomes oblivious to her surroundings,  thus often coming across as a lot more insensitive than she really is. In addition most ponies seem to assume that there isn't all that much to Pinkie except parties,  jokes,  songs,  parties,  pranks and any other synonyms to the proceeding. They assume they already know Pinkie and that there isn't much to know ("Pinkie,  your so random"!,  "It's just Pinkie being Pinkie")
<p></p>Oddly enough it kind of explains why Pinkie never seems to suffer much in the way of consequences to her actions. Often times Pinkie in her enthusiasm will do something wrong and not even realize it,  and everypony else while getting angry initially will shrug it off to just "Pinkie being Pinkie" (it also doesn't help that one of the few times Pinkie herself admits possible wrong doing in Griffon the Brush Off,  Dash just tells her not to worry). So what we get is a a pony whop doesn't always realize when she has done something wrong,  and who usually assumes that she is in that right because no one is willing to tell her otherwise.
