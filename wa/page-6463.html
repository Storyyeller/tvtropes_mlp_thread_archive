            Eh,  it's depend on what I feel like writing most first. The sequel to a story that was effectively complete but open to a sequel which the fans want,  or a seperate story within the same universe,  exploring a different country and being much,  MUCH darker due to the aforementioned Witch-hunter(Who is named Salem. And exists in a constant state of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">Tranquil Fury</a>. And attempts to kill the protagonists <em>immediately</em> upon sight,  with no warning.)
<p></p>But now is not the time for that(besides,  both come after wild and hilarious sex romps with aunt and uncle orange,  and that after a quarter-life crisis with gay ponies)! L,  I'm about to go make Dinner,  and I'm gonna start watching WITCH while I eat. I'll tell you what I think of the first episode or two when I'm done.

            I keep tossing around Ideas for Fanfiction and Jrpgs. The former Shows that I have not done any original creative writing since middle school,  and the latter shows that I lack key programming skills.

            So,  from what I have been able to discern today's big event was that Ginger finished the first season of Avatar. Well here's hoping you like the next two Ginger.

<p></p>Sweet! Keep in mind that the first few episodes are a bit shaky and exposition heavy,  but it's a extreme exponential increase in quality.

            @ginger: In his case,  the heroes would mostly escape because they're very,  very good at running. <em>Their</em> goal is to not die. <em>His</em> goal is to kill them. And keep in mind he chases them <em>halfway across the continent</em> before he's finally stopped(And by Celestia,  at that). Most of the time they get away it's because of the kindness of a stranger,  not necessarily due to his own faults. And when he does find them,  it's because he's acting the nice guy and asking around for them - being <em>clever</em>,  even if not necessarily duplicitous or scheming. His special talent is basically tracking(Well,  his special talent is technically protection,  but he stretches the definition in various ways - he will do anything to protect what he views as sacred,  in this case racial purity - one could say his true talent is persistence). He introduces himself to the protagonists the first time as thus. "My name is Salem. It is an old word. It means <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Hunter</a></em>."
<p></p>The other villain probably suits your purposes better - he connives,  sneaks behind his master(A god,  mind)'s back and spreads false propaganda to incite a war with a neighboring country,  all while arranging the pieces so that his country will be superior due to a special weapon undiscovered by any other country. He loses not because he's outgambitted,  but simply because the hero convinces the populace not to go to war. His 'plot' is never revealed,  as far as anypony knows it was simply a diplomatic incident that was resolved peacefully. Also,  there is the issue of one of the hero's companions sabotaging a few key plans on his part. Hi downfall is effectively the result of one very small mistake: Stealing the protagonists 'slave',  which at the time he had no reason to believe would be of any import.

<p></p>Also,  has anyone seen Gargoyles? I'm watching it right now. It's actually pretty intense for a children's Disney show <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

Disney is really horrible to Greg Weisman.

            @ Ginger,  becuase the last season SUCKED!,  the real ending was the season 2 finale,  season 3 was created by Disney wihtout the original creator invovled just to milk money out of the franchise,  while competly altering it and butchering it.
