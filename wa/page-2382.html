            She seems to have a real need to be appreciated/liked (Party of One),  and for her to hear mocking laughter from all sides,  much of which sounded like her friends,  that was horrifying for her.

            There's a funny thing I see about Fluutershy's breaking. She acted what would normally be considered kind and thoughtful in regards to Discord. Well by behaving in "kindly manner" to the spirit of chaos,  would that not be an unkind thing to do? I mean it pissed Discord of right?

            Even in "Party Of One" Her world view didn't change or break so much per-say,  as her friend's place in  it shifted. She was devestated,  but she was still willing to turn to inanimate obejcts rather then abondend her world view and admit that maybe she was the one who should change (which should have been the conclusion from her friends supossedly wanting to leave her)

            With Discord I think the deal is that he just enjoys breaking them on his own,  then brainwashing them just to be sure.
<p></p>As for Pinkie,  yeah,  her well-being is really <em>really</em> tied up in having other ponies around all the time.  Her cutie mark is based on that sort of interaction,  and not being able to get that interaction is what causes her freak out.  In "Party of One" it was because she thought they didn't want to be her friends anymore,  and in the season opener it was because she believed they only liked having her around to laugh at her.  Either way,  she thought that her friends didn't like her.

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Eh let me rephrase. Fluttershy's kindness caused Discord's attempts in bringing her down to fail. However,  it was still unkind to cause Discord to get angry.</div>
<p></p>That makes no sense to me.
<p></p>If she'd <em>deliberately</em> acted to piss him off,  yes,  that'd be unkind. But she didn't. She reacted in a way that,  if she was dealing with <em>literally</em> anyone else,  would have been a hell of a lot nicer than they deserved in response to a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HannibalLecture" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HannibalLecture">Hannibal Lecture</a>. Calling Discord's reaction a sign that Fluttershy was unkind is like...if I get you a Christmas present I think you'll like,  and you hate it,  does that make me unkind?

Well,  I don't think she was trying to get him upset. She acted as herself. But the outcome resulted in Discord getting angry.
<p></p>Edit: It'd be unkind to say you hated it. But I digress.

            It's very much Discord's problem.  Fluttershy is just so conciliatory that he <em>can't</em> turn her by simple manipulation.

Given that any situation with Discord active can generally be classified as a "loss",  I'd say the "win" condition with Discord is to stuff him back in his box and leave him there.
