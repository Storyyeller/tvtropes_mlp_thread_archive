            It depends on whether or not you're copying your mind or dividing it. If you're dividing it,  then two of you is only half as mentally capable of as you normally are. Making yourself dumber when you're trying to guide and protect people would be a bad idea,  and straight up copies has all sorts of implications.

            Personally,  the kind of mental capability for multi-point perception is limited for creatures without the necessary mental architecture to use it at full capacity,  like,  say,  cyborgs with supplementary computing power to parallel-process all that extra information.
<p></p>Even the higher-tier Pantheon-class gods I've seen limit their use of this power because it leaves them defenseless when they use it. Even <em>Maia</em> and <em>Valar</em> like Morgoth and Sauron don't exhibit such multi-point perception.

            The method I reverse-engineered was to leave some kind of reflection of yourself in countless dreamscapes,  all linked back to you. If anything catches a Reflection's attention,  it will alert you and allow you to take control of the Reflection and personally intervene.

            @Bad We don't. Which is why I find jumping to the conclusion that makes the characters as powerful as possible makes no sense to me.  All it will do is make things later on make no sense. If the characters are really that powerful,  then issues arise when problems that should be easily solvable if they had that level of power are not easily solved.

            @Ace: That's not true. manwe sees <em>everything</em> and his partner <em>hears everything</em>. In <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DnD" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DnD">Dn D</a>,  even the weakest deity can sense everything that has anything to do with their portfolio in the <em>multiverse</em>. The stronger ones can sense it <em>before it happens</em>.
<p></p>@Perpetual: Firstly,  as Badwolf says,  you're making assumptions about it requiring genius intellect when there's no need for it to do so. Secondly,  as I've said before. We watched her <em>literally split herself,  away from prying eyes</em>. So they weren't constructs or illusions. The reason that I've been pulling the "other characters can do it card" is not for evidence but to demonstrate that it's hardly unique so I don't get the hesitation to accept it when the evidence indicates it.
<p></p>EDIT: <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I accept the interpretation that makes the most sense to me. What <em>I</em> don't get is the insistence on assuming that they are as <em>weak</em> as possible and interpretting the evidence with that light. I've adjusted my assumptions of their powerlevel <em>multiple times</em> based on what I've seen in the show. And generally,  the show keeps telling me that I've been too conservative in my guesses.

            Remember dreams usually run on accelerated time. Perhaps Luna keeps jumping her consciousness between them (we only see her twice in an otherwise rather long sequence) and time compression means she gets the conversations that would in the real world take a few minutes down to a few seconds.

            @Sereg The evidence does not <em>disprove</em> it,  but it does not in any way <em>indicate</em> it. Hence,  I assume the easier and lower power solution that raises less further questions.
<p></p>And why does her creating the Shadowbolts out of sight indicate anything? You don't create your illusions in front of the intended target because then they would know they aren't real. It's common sense.

            @ Lurker: I fail to see what scenario Luna being able to visit everypony's dreams would inhibit. Every adventure plot we've seen so far as either not been ponies,  Luna herself or the most powerful Unicorn/Smoke Monster Sombra.

Sure,  it doesn't affect the day-today plot,  but it raises questions about how she didn't know about things like the Changeling invasion plan well ahead of time,  for a quick example.

            I made an edit. Also,  I have no idea how the power levels I assume would make things any easier to solve. After all,  I'm scaling enemies <em>together</em>. And as I said,  I interpret by the most <em>literal</em> version. Because that requires the fewest assumptions

            Depends. Being more aware than other persons/ponies doesn't mean jack if you can't <em>do</em> anything about it. Even assuming she <em>can</em> divide her consciousness effectively between several thousand ponies,  a mental power doesn't always translate into being effective against threats like Sombra.

            @Sereg But you are making assumptions. This is the literal interpretation given what we know:
<p></p>Luna can visit dreams. She is seen in Scootaloo's dreams on two separate nights. She says that it is her duty as Princess of the Night to do so. <em>That's it</em>. Nothing about visiting every dream everywhere at once,  even where she is not needed. Nothing about being able to split her consciousness at will with no ill effects. I'm the one not making any assumptions,  here.

This. Though I prefer "patrols" instead of "wanders". Gives it more of a sense of duty.
