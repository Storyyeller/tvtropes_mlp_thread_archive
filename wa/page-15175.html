            <em>The dance is in three days,  why don't you already have a crown?</em>
<p></p>They did have a crown,  but it was cheap aluminum with "Made in Baltimare" on it.  They naturally decided Twilight's crown was better.

            I did like the bit where,  <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">regardless of who's wearing the crown,  Twilight has a special connection with the Element. Due to a combination of using the Element before,  and the fact that she has the Power Of Friendship on her side. So Sunset Shimmer was never able to use the power of the crown against Twilight.</span>

            @Crow: Here's how I saw the crown thing work:  The fall formal crown happened to look identical to Twilight's. Sunset steals that one,  and attempts to switch it with Twilight's magic crown.  The mundane one stays in Equestria while Sunset brings them magic crown back to the human world.  Upon re-entry,  Fluttershy finds it and brings it to Principal Celestia,  who believes it to be the fall formal crown (which was missing because Sunset had stolen it).  That's why it ended up being the fall formal crown; a crown with that design had already been prepared,  and it got inadvertently switched with Twilight's without Celestia realizing it.
<p></p>A better question is why,  after the rest of the human mane cast believes her story about being from another world and everything didn't just help her bust into the office and steal the thing.  Nobody would suspect them,  and Twilight would disappear afterwards anyway.

            I'd say that magic already existed in the human world,  but because humans don't have any built in apparatus for using it,  it goes mostly unnoticed. The Element of Magic obviously serves as means to utilize that power.  My guess is that the human world has it's own set of elements,  and a potential spinoff could focus on the human cast trying to find them or get them to manifest.
<p></p>@Sereg: Yeah,  but it's not like it's going to be under heavy guard or anything.  It's in a box in the principal's office.  All you'd have to do is bust a window and grab the box and head back through the portal.  They can worry about opening the case once they're back in Equestria.
<p></p>@Apple: Chrysalis is already pretty close,  and at the very least Luna proved that alicorns can <em>become</em> bad,  at least temporarily.

            @JT:  That actually makes a lot of sense.  I still wonder why Celestia didn't notice that the crown was suddenly not a cheap piece of shit,  but whatever.  If I were principle I wouldn't pay much attention to Fall Formal popularity crap either.
<p></p>I agree that theft would have been a much simpler solution.  I doubt Celestia has it under very extensive security.
<p></p>My main issue with the way the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EoM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EoM">Eo M</a> acted was why Sunset could even use it.  Twi needed to gather the five elements before it would even appear,  but this random asshole can use it to mind control people?

            I always thought that the Elements themselves were merely the gun and the users are the ammo,  with the Element of Magic as the trigger.  They merely unleash the users inner power,  and combine them together.

<p></p>Kind-of related:  I read a story once about how a woman was walking her dog and carrying a small bag in one hand.  Some guy ran up,  snatched the bag out of her hand,  and kept on running.
<p></p>He stole a bag of dog poop. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            <div class="quoteblock">@Sereg: Doesn't that theory make the element of magic evil. I mean,  draining magic to power itself up and possessing people doesn't exactly match up with what we know of the EOH. </div>
<p></p>Nope. It's not really <em>draining</em> magic from others,  but rather absorbing the background magic radiation they give off. And it's not possessing them. Just giving them the ability to use itself. (The Element can obviously be <em>used</em> by evil given the events of the film. It simply wants to be used.)

            Yeah,  I didn't think that felt genuine at all,  mainly because her entire characterization up to that point was pure <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>.  If they wanted her to feel most sympathetic they needed to develop her motivation more.  Maybe delve into exactly <em>why</em> she failed as Celestia's student.  As is,  it felt more like a kid who got caught with their hand in the cookie jar.
