            Alternatively,  the WINGED UNICORN Amulet is nothing more then a glorified battery,  and the main reason ponies get corrupted is because wielding all that sheer magical power goes straight to the head.
<p></p>(Yup,  still in denial.)

            My personal canon: The Amulet once belonged to Sombra,  who was trying to gain the power of alicorns. He was only defeated when he took it off. However the evil within had overwritten his original personality.
<p></p>The Steve Headcanon: The Amulet once belonged to a fanatical Nazi officer,  whose beliefs and morals were imprinted on the badge we wore. Trixie actually became that officer in her mind when she wore it.

            The unicorns come with in-built telekinesis. Strengthening and/or focusing it enough to fire a small pellet out of a tube would be a great way to get rid of recoil.
<p></p>Of course,  if we have access to gunpowder,  there is a whole scope of possibilities:
<p></p>The easiest to design would be pegasi weapons,  since they pretty much fly with their heads level with their body. Thus a cannon or a crosbow can be strapped to their sides or underbelly without much loss in accuracy.
<p></p>The king of the battlefield would be artillery,  which can be operated by anyone without much trouble,  and the Gatling rotary cannon: crank-operated,  mounted on a trailer,  with three pony crew (loader,  gunner,  and "driver"). It would be their chariot equivalent.

            I reckon the Alicorn Amulet was how Sombra initially became powerful,  but his later Dark Magic is independant of the Amulet,  which he had stopped using by the time he conquered the Crystal Kingdom.

            Boy,  I have to say that the "Magic Duel" episode sure opens the door to a lot of different possibilities! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">
<p></p><ol><li> The word "alicorn" is now canon! I know that Celestia,  Luna,  and Cadence have been the only alicorns depicted so far,  but what if there are more?
</li><li> Where was that town and shop the Alicorn Amulet was in? It was reminding me a lot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> there. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">
</li><li> So an age spell is possible,  but only at the highest level? Could it be that Celestia,  Luna,  and <em>maybe</em> Cadence have been using this spell to remain effectively immortal? Have a number of ponies made use of that spell to live long lives,  or do they just let their lives take their natural course? Twilight is unable to do the spell at this time,  but maybe she will one day.
</li><li> It's interesting that there may be a spell to change the gender of a pony.
</li></ol><p></p>You want to know something that may qualify as <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a>? <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaurenFaust" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaurenFaust">Lauren Faust</a> has said that she wanted Zecora to be <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor">The Mentor</a> to Twilight,  but it didn't happen,  because <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> episodes were easier to do.

            Thre really isn't much vhoice with pony weapons,  they sinply do not have the versatility that having hands presents us. And yeah all their options are fairly inpracticle,  bu keep in mid the other side they are fighting has the exact same limitations,  and more,  the Zebras didn't have unicorns that could TK.
<p></p>And yes they address the recoil,  most pony guns seem to be designed to have minimal recoil,  and the more powerful ones are outright stated to only be useable by the strongest EP's or unicorns via TK. And the bigger guns are basicly side mounted guns and while they would be hard to aim and be good with,  with enough practice that can be overcome,  Calamity is an expert marksman who uses Battle Saddle weaponry.
<p></p>And far as i'm concerned every fic takes place in it's own AU. Yes FOE can get Dark,  but it's never Grimdark,  the darkness is there as a tool,  not for the sake of being dark,  in the end it is about hope,  how no matter o=how bad it seems,  sometimes all it takes is the right little spark to set the blaze that will burn away the darkness and bring back the light of hope.
<p></p>As to the canon ponies fates,  over all,  yes some of them do get pretty bad,  but really it's not many that dont end up getting either a decent ending,  or at least make it worth it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Twilight-spends the time since the war as part of the Goddess Gestalt,  but survives long enough afterwards to save lil'pip and hear Pinkie Pie's last message to her,  telling her she was right and that Pinkie was going to work at becoming the old Pinkie. RD-ultimate fate unkown,  though last seen trapped in SPP command,  with Gilda flying around outside to kill her if she comes out. Fluttershy-Trapped as a tree by Killer Joke,  but eventaully cured and helps to rebuild Equestria. Rarity-Sacrifices herself to save Fluttershy,  Pinkie-Realizes how she's bucked up her life,  admits she needs to change and begins to work on fixing it,  only for the bombs to fall (probably the most tragic of the mane 6's ends) AJ-Lives a long full life in Stable 2,  eventually dying of old age.</span>

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">sigh... what I mean is. Right from the off she's not like other Alicorns. She's unique.
<p></p>If I was writing this story,   I'd have her be a completely ordinary alicorn chosen arbitrarily by the Goddess to go into Hoofington (since as she explained,   the pain of one alicorn in Hoofington is manageable) . When we first see her she's EXACTLY like ANY other Alicorn,   but as she travels with BJ and co,   and as the area of Hoofington takes it toll on her,   she slowly grows more and more apart from the goddess and begins to show hints of her true personality.
<p></p>As things stand,   she STARTED off with too much personality.
