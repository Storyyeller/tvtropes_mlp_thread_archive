            Okay,  here's the eps in my Discontinuity pile,  along with reasons:
<p></p><em>Mysterious Mare-do-Well</em> - Because the level of technology present totally contradicts every other episode.  In "Winter Wrap-Up" snow-ploughs had to be pushed by ponies manually,  but this episode has a pony driving a tractor which seems no different than the kind us humans use (which should be impossible).
<p></p><em>A Friend in Deed</em> - My big problem is Pinkie's portrayal and how this episode feels more like its trying to advance her as a marketing icon than tell a story.  That it introduces donkey homeowners is just the cherry on top.
<p></p><em>Putting Your Hoof Down</em> - Angel,  who has always been shown as caring for Fluttershy,  in this episode kicks her out of her own house for not putting a cherry on a damn treat.  Ponyville is inexplicably dark and mean-spirited.  Also I found Iron Will just obnoxious,  and probably would have hated him even if he weren't a minotaur.
<p></p><em>Dragon Quest</em> - I actually <em>would</em> have accepted the dragon society if they had behaved more exotically and not like a bunch of stereotypical white american male teenagers.  On top of that... dragons want Spike to kill a baby (essentially),  then act like they're gonna kill Spike.  Again,  way too dark for this particular show.  The "namby-pamby pony princess" B.S. just seals the deal.
<p></p><em>Mmmystery on the Friendship Express</em>' - Return of face-of-the-franchise bland mascot Pinkie (as compared to the Pinkie who gave us "Forever!") who now talks like she's got problems (okay,  so she kind of <em>does</em>,  but still).  Also I know I'm in the minority but I <em>hate</em> classic movie homages,  especially since Twilight acknowledging a laser defense system without questioning what it is brings up the same technology issues that MMDW had (I tend to see homages as a sign that the writer ran out of ideas,  too).
<p></p>Really,  its less "I'm speciesist" (though I totally am) and more "having a non-pony named character is the first sign the episode is gonna suck."

            <div class="quoteblock">After I read House of Leaves I was all excited to read Only Revolutions. I got it,  read about 40 pages (20 from each side,  cause that's how you do it?),  and didn't understand a single thing that had "happened." I'm afraid Only Revolutions is beyond my understanding. I don't like poetry at all anyway,  so I really should have known better.</div>
Yeah,  it was definitely hard to slog through. I think with the book flipping,  it wasn't necessarily that you had to understand what happens in each section. Both characters had the same,  or similar events happen to them without many details revealed,  mostly because of the system of writing he used. I think you just had to get a vague idea of the events as you read them and try to figure it out. It really isn't much more than just a road trip in the end,  and there are definite major events. I can remember the job hunt,  the hospital and the mountain climb at the end,  but it is without a doubt a mostly impenetrable wall. Bluh,  I am such a bad book critic who also types very slow apparently. <br> <br>With the Rarity picture,  I'm assuming it's supposed to be her in Canterlot around Sweet and Elite,  considering the tiara. <br> <br>Personally,  I prefer the original Discord to Tombstone's mix. Not entirely sure why. It's just missing something. <br> <br>Related,  Eurobeat Brony just released a Diamond Dogs song. It doesn't have lyrics,  but I still think it's pretty good. <center><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="425" height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tlWCQmlhZa0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

            @Moe: I disagree. Technology has shown to be quite schizo in Equestria,  since they have things like taffy pullers and microwaves and even a food processor (Sisterhooves Social).

            I consider Discontinuity only as far as "noncanon" writers go,  and even then only if their works are not generally consistent with the main series proper.

            @Moe So,  essentially,  where some see world building and expansion,  you see it as destroying the established world instead? Fair enough,  I guess. I still disagree,  though.

The only bit of the plot I understood was what was written on the books dust jacket.  I think there was something about a tree as well.
