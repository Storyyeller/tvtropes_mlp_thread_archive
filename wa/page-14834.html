            Things I'd like to see them bring back:
<p></p>1. LBYS-esque episodes that show the characters bouncing off of each other in mundane situations.  Seriously,  just find an excuse to lock Rarity into a room with Pinkie or Rainbow Dash and the episode will write itself.
<p></p>2. AJ's stubborness.  It came up a bit in "The Last Roundup",  but it rarely shows up in S3.  Bringing it back would allow them to make an episode that was actually focused on AJ and not just her reacting to other characters.
<p></p>3. I concur with the relationship episodes thing.  I'd love for them to just focus on a group of 2 or 3 ponies just hanging out,  especially if it's a group we don't see spend much time together. Like Rarity and Rainbow Dash,  or Twilight and Pinkie.  Or even better,  Spike and somepony besides Twilight or Rarity.

            <span class="blue">I quite like Adventure Episodes,  but even they could be turned into Relationship Episodes easily enough.  Just make a smaller scale quest that only needs 2 or 3 ponies to go along.  Kind of like how in the Pinkie Sense episode Pinkie,  Twilight and Fluttershy were the only ones who went to the swamp (and promptly attacked by the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>).

            What I'm getting at is that there's a trap  in providing <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding">World Building</a> too quickly. As the writers impose limits and concepts even if vague,  it restricts the universe and makes it feel smaller.
<p></p>Smaller scale fantasy plots can help restore some discovery in the setting.
<p></p>By now we've been to the Crystal Empire,  explored the Everfree,  defeated our enemies and befriended the spirit of chaos,  and made Equestria stronger with another monarch. You can't help but ask: So what now?
<p></p>Which is why season 4 should take the opertunity to take Twilight and friends beyond Equestria and free themselves of so many restrictions for a fresh start. It's the perfect time now Twilight is Princess to go to new places.
<p></p>Sorry if I'm posting and writing too much guys.

            So,  looking at the past 10 pages of this thread,  I found out that Alicorn Twilight was planned from the start. Now what I want to know is how stupid those dumbass "ALICORN TWILIGHT RUINED THE SHOW" fanboys are feeling right now.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_evilgrin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="evil grin" title="evil grin">
<p></p>As for the current topic,  I think that's why I sort of like S1 a little more then the other two seasons: A lot more charector interaction was featured in it. RD's rivelry with AJ,  AJ's stubborness,  Twilight and Pinkie's tendency to not get along {At least on Twilight's part: Pinkie is just fine with Twilight},  episodes that actually focus more on the charectors in general,  etc. Why were all of these concepts just dropped and forgotten about? Is it a side-effect of having a couple diffrent writers in the later seasons or something?

            I wonder what Bonnie Zacherle would think of MLP:FIM and the bronies? I mean,  I really want to see her at a future brony convention someday and maybe do a panel like John De Lanchie did. I would love to see hear her thoughts and the origins behind the franchise. Heck,  Lauren Faust gets alot of praise in the fandom. Why not Bonnie Zacherle?

            I honestly prefer the relationship episodes to the adventure ones,  so I'd honestly kinda prefer that the show focus more on that in S4 than on introducing more locations or whatever.  Then again,  if I was in charge of the show,  90% of it would take place in Ponyville,  and the other 10% would be in Canterlot.
<p></p>But seriously,  I'd much rather explore the places we already know rather than introduce any new settings. I mean,  take the Crystal Empire for instance. We've been to the location a few times,  but I don't feel like we've gotten much of a feel for what it's like because we only see it during extreme events.  I'd love an episode where like,  the Mane 6 take a vacation there for a week,  and end up squabbling for some reason. Like maybe Twilight and Rarity want a meticulously planned itinerary,  whereas Pinkie and RD want freedom to do what they want when they want,  and AJ and Fluttershy just don't care.  That way we'd get some good character moments,  as well as seeing what the Crystal Empire is like when it's not being attacked by Sombra,  or prepping for a major event.
<p></p>Also,  is there a way on Derpibooru to change the order of images?  Like could I search for a tag and have it sorted by score rather than by upload date?
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Probably because while Bonnie created the franchise,  Faust was the one who made it respectable. Before FIM,  the toyline had a pretty lousy reputation as being overbearingly girly and saccharine.

            See,  this is what I like about pony fanfics: You arn't constrained by a 21-minute time limit. If you wanted to get plenty of charector interactions and also do some world building at the same time,  you could easily do that,  whereas the show generally has to do one of those options with a little bit of the other option thrown in. Not to mention how there are plenty of fanfics that use the wasted potential that certain episodes/ideas had {Stuff like Dragon Quest} and also manages to keep some of the interesting charector traits {Stuff like AJ's stubborness and AJ and RD's rivelry} which the show just somehow forgot about.
