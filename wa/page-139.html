            This episode,  in conjunction with Cutie Mark Chronicles,  demonstrates that Pinkie Pie's character has much more depth than previously thought.

            Hey it's that lava demon from G1 that surfs on lava.  I think he's considered one of the most badass villains from that era.  How can you NOT like a villain that uses RAINBOW POWERS.

            I don't know how often I've watched Pinkie's emo sequence now. Watched the episode,  rewatched it,  watched that scene again,  watched parts of it again to pick out avatars,  watched it again,  possibly again...
<p></p>... So yeah I think this episode has suddenly become one of my favorites.
<p></p>I hope it has nothing to do with how dizzy I'm feeling today,  though.
<p></p>So yeah. That was amazing. Pinkie Pie has become my favorite character,  woo.
<p></p>See,  thing is. It... makes sense! No one can simply be crazy happy like that all the time. Unless they're insane,  maybe. But I'm not saying that she is insane. Not normally,  no.
<p></p>She grew up in a colorless and unhappy place,  until she realized that she didn't want to live like that anymore. So she set out to make life more colorful. The first party was kind of an experiment – she hadn't become fully "Pinkie Pie" yet,  as evidenced by how she quickly loses faith in the idea that her family could approve of it. As she grew older,  using laughter as a defense mechanism to cope with stress became the core of her identity. This is also shown in her "No Fear" song,  which addresses the subject more or less directly.
<p></p>Sometimes you have to smile first so that the world will smile back at you. Pinkie knows this. She became the mask,  so to speak,  except it's not much of a mask because it is sincere. But it has to be a mask,  because emotions swing back and forth like a pendulum. Pinkie Pie's weakness,  which was exhibited here,  is her deathly fear of being alone. Which also explains all the parties.
<p></p>... I just sent Lauren a message about this wooo

            Though I wouldn't call her deathly fear being alone. I think its more "being rejected". At first she was just bummed when nobody would show up to her party,  it wasn't until she realized they were all lying and she thought they didn't want to be her friends anymore that she lost it. Actually reminds of Twilight it that regard.

            Episodes like this make me remember why I love Friendship Is Magic so very much. In twenty minutes,  they turned the flattest (but still awesome) pony into someone far more complicated. It's kind of amazing that a show about small,  girly ponies has better female characters than most films and TV.

            This gives us a great idea how Pinkie Pie would have turned out had she never found her cutie mark.Makes me wonder how the others would have wound up. Applejack trying to fit in while living in the big city even though she's not really happy. Twilight would have never known about her gift for magic and would go through life feeling unimportant. Rarity would have ended up a designer I'm sure but probably not as succesful. I can easily see her working as an assitant to someone who consantly belittles her. If we assume Fluttershy had never left Cloudsdale she'd just be a klutz who couldnt' fly right,  constantly mocked. Honestly Rainbow Dash was the only one who seemed happy BEFORE she got her cutie mark. She admits she always loved flying,  her cutie mark was about her racing and flying FAST.

            I'm with Fawriel (Grr,  I was going to use Emo-Pinkie as my avatar <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">) on this one. It's definitely Pinkie Pie's characterization a large part of what makes this episode so brilliant. And not even just Emo Pinkie,  but how Pinkie Pie slowly begins to grow more agitated,  insecure,  and angry. Normally this would be stock for such a show,  but given Pinkie's past behavior (in this very episode,  in fact) it's brilliance on the part of the writers. You can really <em>see</em> her losing it,  specially from the Rainbow Dash Chase scene all the way to the Interrogation. It's what really jolted me up and made me pay attention. Not to mention,  I think I sympathize a lot with said situation... Hrmm.
<p></p>Also,  Insane Pinkie is Best Pinkie. Come on,  that hair looks adorable on her.

Yeah,  that was great. Best part was when she realized she was talking to a pile (now not-so-pile) of rocks and then sighed. And stuff.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Now I feel kind of bad for finding insane Pinkie creepy. </div>
Don't. I did,  too. ^^;
<p></p>I mean,  I loved her,  but that scene where her eyes just sloooowly diverge just makes me shudder with equal amounts of glee and fear.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Though I wouldn't call her deathly fear being alone. I think its more "being rejected". At first she was just bummed when nobody would show up to her party,  it wasn't until she realized they were all lying and she thought they didn't want to be her friends anymore that she lost it. Actually reminds of Twilight it that regard. </div>
I'm not sure if there's much of a difference there. Being rejected still leads to being lonely. It's just faster and has a larger emotional impact.

            Does anyone else think Pinkie's new friends were Flanderizations of the other ponies?  Rocky is Rainbow Dash,  Turnip is Applejack,  Sir Lintsalot is Rarity and Madam <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeFlour" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeFlour">Le Flour</a> is Fluttershy.

            I kind of wonder why she didn't bring in Spike,  because he was her last friend,  so to speak. But he probably would have eaten her new "friends",  so it's just as well.
