            The irony being that the film was a flop with a low budget,  hammy acting,  and providing many a meme,  but it's become a colt classic regularly being shown on projectors across Equestria.

            Hey everyone,  I'm back!  The iridotomy went off without a hitch,  though afterwards I couldn't really see all that well due to the eye drops they administered that constricted my pupils,  so I took the rest of the day off.  Afterwards I got some pho with my dad and then collapsed at his place before getting my car and coming back home.  Oh,  and the rather pretty nurse praised my "beautful eyes".  That almost made the terrible brow ache and quavering vision caused by the drops worth it.

            Glad everything went okay,  Thirikal.
<p></p>I had my pupils dilated once.  Everything was fine until I walked outside afterwards and stepped into the sunlight.  It was like the sun had exploded right in front of me.  I yelled "JESUS!",  slammed my eyes shut and cringed from the sudden pain.  Fortunately,  my mom was with me to guide me to the car and do the driving.  She also kept a cheap pair of sunglasses in the car.
<p></p>It would have been nice if the eye doctor had given me a pair of throwaway sunglasses before I left,  or at least warned me.

            Well,  they didn't actually dilate my eyes the way they usually do.  They constricted them to lessen the chance of hitting a blood vessel when they made the incisions.  Of course,  I still have two more surgeries 'til I should be able to see normally (one for each eye).  The purpose of today's surgery was just to make the incisions in the iris so they could more easily inject the collagen/polymer lens in the next two surgeries.  I walked away today feeling a bit as if I'd been socked in the eyes.
<p></p>I will agree that getting your pupils dilated still sucks.  Especially if you are already highly photophobic (light sensitive,  not fear of light.  That'd be heliophobic).

            I had that happen as a result ofa few of my surgeries.
<p></p>The reverse is also unpleasant. I once went into Anaphylactic shock which caused large parts of my body's muscles to shut down including legs and throat. Fortunately doctors were able to get most of it under control aside from my eyes which were stuck shut. I had to rub an oil on my eyes for 3 days to get them back open.

            So,  ever since I discovered the pic at the bottom of this post {Which I've posted before},  I now really,  really like the "Blind Vinyl Scratch" fanon,  even though it was <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Jossed</a> by the S2 and S3 finales. I think there's some potential with the idea,  especially since there are actual <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindMusician" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindMusician">Blind Musicians</a> in RL. I might even read Kegi's fanfic with her in it since it's one of the few fics to actually have this concept.
