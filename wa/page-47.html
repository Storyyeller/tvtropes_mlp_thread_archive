            I thought the song was hilarious. Like a parody of those bad cartoon songs that bludgeon you over the head with the blunt end of the show's moral.

            ^^I thought it was funny because it felt so out-of-place to me,  somehow.
<p></p>Also,  what is the proper usage of anything suffixed "-pony",  within the show? Some "-body" words have managed to slip by.

            Well,  "-body" was used when they were also including the buffaloes. So I guess it means "-pony" should only be used when <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">only ponies are included</a>.

            I actually quite liked Pinkie's song. It wasn't my favorite,  but it was still pretty catchy,  and it was a funny scene to watch. The choice of outfit was...odd,  in a kids show,  but that might just be my perverse brain. But the clam...
<p></p>It definitely wasn't one of my favorite episodes,  but I wouldn't call it bad at all,  and it certainly isn't fair to call the writer out on it. I mean,  this a pretty character-driven show,  so the plot centric (as opposed to character centric like Green isn't you Colour)episodes aren't always as funny,  you can hardly blame the guy for that. And really,  the big reason people didn't like Pinkie Keen wasn't because it wasn't funny,  it's just that the Aesop made people a tad uncomfortable.

<p></p>But yeah - the amount of grimdark and downer fanfics might make a sad ending episode a little redundant. Still,  a "learning to say goodbye to friends" episode would be fitting.

            Oh my god,  if the final episode of the show was Twilight having to go back to Princess Celestia and then the letter at the end was her being all like "Eventually you will have to say goodbye to your friends" then I would <em>cry buckets.</em> And I've only watched like four episodes of MLP.

            I dunno.  I think that even if they all split up,  they'll stay in touch,  and probably get together every once in a while.  Your friends care about you,  even when you're far away.

            Yeah,  I don't think the series would end on such a down note. It would probably more likely end with a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward">Flash Forward</a> to them in the future.

            I've noticed that "anyone" and "everyone" has been in use. Presumably,  "-pony" only replaces "-body".
<p></p>And regarding electricity,  there's a shop in Ponyville that sells electric fans. I'm guessing that the low tech level in Appleloosa is a result of prohibitive costs,  whether that comes from transportation or the means that go into making it. I might have missed it,  but were there even any non-earth ponies there? I guess another possibility is that they're just off the grid because they're too far away from power sources. Then I guess we might ask how Equestria gets power. We know they have a windmill in Ponyville at least. Maybe some of it comes from unicorn magic? Pegasus abilities? We've seen Rainbow Dash kick a cloud to make it spark lightning. Oh yeah! I seem to remember at least one of the Wonderbolts had a trail of electrified storm-clouds. I'm thinking the pegasus ponies are probably the most likely candidates for power generating duties.
<p></p>As to the question about why they didn't throw rocks,  I'm pretty sure that the ponies were nice enough to not want to seriously injure the buffalo. I guess that doesn't really explain the anvils,  but maybe they're aware that anvils operate on cartoon physics? Why they bothered to make them pies... I'd say that they wanted to make use of "splash damage" (for lack of a better term) when facing a large group. Also,  pies are made of things besides apples,  so less apples are used per pound of ammo.
<p></p>Anyway,  this episode was great. I was a little disappointed with Pinkie's song,  but the ridiculous presentation and lampshade hanging made up for it.
<p></p>Oh,  and as to the person asking about the difference between Ponychan and 4chan...
<p></p>4chan is... Well there's quite a lot of people who can give you their take on it. It's pretty well known. However,  each board has a different culture. /b/ is easily the most hostile,  but even then you'd be hard-pressed to find a sizable thread in which every poster is being an enormous tool. It also moves very fast,  so it can be hard to keep a thread alive. There are pony threads on that board,  but it tends to get spammed with gore. /co/ is the thread for comics and cartoons,  and is the only other board that allows pony threads,  but even then it only allows one at a time and prohibits furry crap or porn of the show. Last I checked,  they also prohibited using pony pictures as avatars. Before the new rules,  there used to be quite a bit more distasteful pictures,  but since /co/ is a SFW board,  they were kept under spoilers. There tends to be some arguing,  even between bronies,  and it tends to be mostly about fan-fics,  art,  and shipping.
<p></p>Since Ponychan allows for more threads,  it's much more easier to keep a conversation on topic,  and there are less restrictions (though porn is still restricted). Because the topics are divided,  threads move much more slowly than pony threads on 4chan. Also,  the wordfilter,  while charming,  can at times hamper legitimate communication. (e.g. "gay" —&gt; "pony"; "hate" —&gt; "love"). Regarding the culture,  users are a <em>lot</em> more sensitive than on 4chan and will be quick to remind you that hate won't be tolerated. Hell,  I've even been temp-banned,  and that's never happened to me before elsewhere. It's like you have to deal with a bunch of Rarities and Fluttershies. I guess to complete the analogy,  4chan has more Gildas,  Pinkie Pies,  and Rainbow Dashes?
<p></p>Of course,  take this with a lick of salt and a glass of water,  since I haven't used these sites as much as some.
