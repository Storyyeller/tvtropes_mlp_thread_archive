            I don't really think that RD fits the model of "pride" or egoism though. There's nothing wrong about feeling good about yourself (and others) if it's proportional to what you've done / are.

            Yeah,  Rainbow is constantly training,  constantly reaching for the goal of being good enough to join the Wonderbolts. And her pride in her abilities is certainly justified.

            @Wazkatango: I would think that people of exceptional ability would be even more vulnerable of fulling into pride/hubris. In that sense I think RD does fit the type.

            Which are things they've both already demonstrated capability of doing. Dash has <em>not</em> demonstrated her ability to impress the wonderbolts with her tricks[ - at least not to the degree where they'd instantly accept her into their team.
<p></p>I'm not calling her arrogant either,  mind you. There's a difference between having an ego and being arrogant. an ego says,  "I'm great." Arrogance says,  "Nothing can challenge me". Dash <em>has</em> a very solid ego. One earned,  to a degree,  but still a giant ego. For example,  thinking it would be an honour to be her pet? Big Ego.

            If we're going by ponies that we realte to,  then from most to least would be:
<p></p>1. Twilight
<p></p>2. Fluttershy (though the test says that these top two should be switched around and I agree that they make a good point. I probably <em>am</em> more like Fluttershy overall)
<p></p>3. Aplejack/Pinkie/Rarity all tied because I relate to them about the same amunt for different reasons
<p></p>4. Rainbow Dash. We're about as different as possible. The only similarity we have is that our ego is dependant on others.

            AJ has sold her apples and apple products to most families in Ponyville. Twilight <em>knows</em> she's Celestia's favourite. Both have good reason to assume that these would carry over.
<p></p>Dash,  meanwhile,  has performed her best trick in front of the wonderbolts and,  this is the important part,  <em>not</em> been asked to join the team. Therefore it <em>is</em> unreasonable to assume that popping off a trick or two would be enough to get her accepted.
<p></p>Rarity's assumption Blueblood would drop everything to marry her was arrogant,  yeah,  but you'll notice she dropped that by second season. Dash,  however,  retains her ego all throughout.
<p></p>And we don't know that the pets thought it was necessarily an honour to be with Dash. From everything I would guess they all just wanted an owner; someone who would care about them regardless of who it was.

            Again i think the Wonderbolts know she has the skill,  but also know she's not ready for a spot on the team becuase she's still to immature and doesn't have the discipline yet. there just waiting for her to grow up a bit more.
