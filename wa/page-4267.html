            Dashie has developed great confidence in Fluttershy's flying abilities. Haven't y'all noticed these last few episodes,  whenever there's action flying to be done,  she always grabs Fluttershy instead of trying to solo or dragoon a random pegasi?

            @Mousa: We got decent variety from her last season,  and the next episode does have a twist on the usual. This episode (admittedly only synopsis to go on) sounds lik a completely straight retelling of Dragonshy but in a different setting.

            It's pretty clear Fluttershy isn't some strong ubergreat flier,  I mean in Return of Harmony Rainbow was being slowed down by a lot of dead weight,  and you don't know if she was pacIng herself for Fluttershy's benefit in say The Last Roundup. At this point you're just looking for reasons to be upset.

            It's funny,  Dashie never seems to coddle Fluttershy for her flying abilities. Instead,  she always seems to assume that Fluttershy can keep up as long as she isn't doing some overkill "Get me in the Wonderbolts" maneuvers,  and Fluttershy seems to be able to keep pace. Don't forget they're both Flight School buddies.

            Hey Ace,  what's up?  Personally I like the idea that Flutter shy is a reasonable flyer.  It stands to reason that most pegasi would be reasonable at flying.  I'm not saying that 'Shy should be Dashie caliber,  but I think her weak flyer status has more to do with being overburdened by her crippling neuroses than anything else.
<p></p>Huh.  It's started snowing.

            @Ginger One Fanfic I read has an interesting Idea on why FS could catch RD in 'The Return Of Harmony'. RD wasn't discorded in the normal way. She was still loyal,  but to Cloudsdale,  not her friends. The fic has RD discorded in a way that meant she wasn't quite out of her mind (she didn't think she was discorded at all,  though she was),  however,  she did not want to own up to her friends that she caused Discord to win his game,  so she (believed she) faked being Discorded under her own will,  and let FS catch up willingly. so she didn't have to own up. (she did own up later).

            Sup Drenius,  my work shift is almost over :D
<p></p>I read another guy's analysis on Fluttershy,  and I agree with his point that while she is not a crazy skilled aerobatics expert like Dashie,  she's definitely not terrible flier. It's mostly her nerves that keep her grounded.
<p></p>After all,  she was also roped into <em>the Last Roundup</em> and the Spike Mission in <em>Secret of my Excess</em> and both times she managed to keep up with Dashie.
<p></p>Anyways,  Fluttershy's rap sheet mostly consists of:
<ul><li>Unauthorized caretaking for Philomena (to be fair the silly phoenix was trolling her)
</li><li>Disorderly conduct resulting in a ruined session of the Grand Galloping Gala
</li><li>Introducing a super-feeder pest into Ponyville's ecosystem,  resulting in a ruined town
</li></ul><p></p>I wonder what they'll do for her these two upcoming eppies?

            She was prolly out of breath,  because she clearly has less stamina than Dashie,  who trains regularly in hopes of signing onto the 'Bolts.
