            I think the inability to plan is a problem for most of the mane six. Twilight plans but doesn't prepare for anything but what she predicts (she probably got it from Celestia - but Celestia is actually smart enough to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessMaster" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessMaster">Chess Master</a> properly,  unlike Twi) and sometimes doesn't even properly prepare for <em>that</em>,  RD runs in without anything resembling a plan,  Pinkie is the same but with the 'wing it' approach as opposed to Dash's 'hit it until it stops' approach,  and Fluttershy is too passive to plan. The only ones who would be any good at planning are AJ and Rarity - they've both handled heavy workloads which demonstrates very good time management skills. AJ is too stubborn to deviate from her plans until the last minute,  but is good at adapting for unseen changes. Rarity,  on the other hand,  tends to just work through problems (her approach to getting more work from her friends while making the dresses? Don't find an easier route,  just <em>work more!</em>). In other words Rarity and AJ are the only ones with the potential to plan,  but while Rarity might make a better initial strategist AJ would be a much better tactician and field leader. In fact AJ is a much better leader to begin with; it makes me wonder why Twi is always the one in charge.

            Twilight is seen as the group's de facto leader because she's the one who basically brought the circle of friends together.  And in that regard it makes sense; she's both relatively level headed and intelligent,  so she can handle all the other ponies in a social setting.  She'd work wonders a a committee chair,  but she makes a pretty field leader because she can't think on her feet; she puts up a plan,  and is kinda lost things deviate from it.
<p></p>Here's how I'd break down the leadership of the group:
<p></p><ol><li> Twilight - most level headed and intelligent.  Capable of empathizing with the other ponies,  very good at delegating responsibilities.  Primary weakness is her trouble with improvising.
<p></p></li><li> Applejack - better at improvising,  has plenty of common sense,  and can keep the other ponies reasonably in line.  She keeps Sweet Apple Acres going,  so she must have decent time management and/or organizational skills,  even if she stinks at math.  Primary weakness is stubbornness; she'd probably butt heads with the other ponies if they don't like her plans.
<p></p></li><li> Rarity - Good time management,  and is a hard worker,  but her priorities get out of whack pretty easily.  She could probably pull it off in a hitch if she had to,  but would definitely have some issues.
<p></p></li><li> Every other pony - Fluttershy is too weak-willed to be a good leader; the other ponies would probably walk all over her because she wouldn't want to ever use her authority.  She could probably come up with good plans,  but would be unable to put them into effect.  Rainbow Dash is too impulsive and probably wouldn't listen to other ponies' plans,  and Pinkie...well that should be obvious.
