<p></p>Not the most impressive thing TTGL has done,  but whatevs.
<p></p>Cosmic Armour Superman apparently lifted a Universe in each hand and punched so hard it destroyed  multiverse and replaced it with another multiverse.
<p></p>Ignoring that,  I could just bring in Elder God Demonbane.
<p></p>Do we really need to get into serial escalation?
<p></p>EDIT:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">If Supe's weakness to magic works the way I think it does,  then considering how much magic Negi puts into his punches,  he'd only need to get one or two hits in. And for someone who can move faster than light,  Superman still gets hit a lot.
<p></p>Of course,  I can also see Supes winning a fight. I just figure Negi ~= Captain Marvel,  and consider it a close match. </div>
<p></p>True. <em>If</em> Negi hits him,  it's all over. Depends on whether or not Superman ramps up his speed enough.

            Power levels. Oh boy.
<p></p>Discussing Superman in regards to power levels has the main problem of ''which Superman?" Early,  golden age Supes couldn't even fly. Silver age Supes can juggle planets. Then there's modern Supes,  who's powerful,  but not as powerful as,  say,  the Spectre or Captain Atom.

            @Crow: I'm not sure. Last I heard,  he <em>wants</em> to,  but the circumstances with his publisher surrounding the series was such a clusterfuck that he's probably just going to leave it an start fresh.  It's a pity it had to end that way,  but given how it got cut off I think he did a pretty good job.

Galactus comes from that wonderful period in comicbook history when you could write a character as the physical embodiment of the heat death of the universe—then draw them as a giant guy in a purple suit and a goofy hat. And readers just accepted it.

<p></p>Not sure about that but it's certianly <em>up</em> there. And it's the most powerful <em>mech</em>. Firstly,  it's so big,  it brushes against other universes and destroys them as it walks. It can throw big bangs,  summon an <em>infinite</em> number of copies of itself (okay,  those are slightly weaker,  but each is still a universe buster). It's magical and was made to fight the entire <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CthulhuMythos" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CthulhuMythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a>,  going toe to toe with <em>Azothoth</em> (who can destroy all the infinite multiverses in the megaverse by 'waking up''). etc.
<p></p>I'm honestly not an expert on it though.

            It might t be that aren't any planned episodes for her in season 4. Rather than it being a case of a planned absence,  it's a lack of planned appearances.

            I doubt there was a deliberate decision to cut Babs from the season.  They probably just didn't pitch any ideas that needed to include her.

            @Irish: Yeah,  about a year ago there was a dispute between the author and his publishers. The TL;DR version is that the publisher basically tried to gank ownership of the copyright out from under him and he ended the series in a combination of protest and wanting to be sure they couldn't steal it.
<p></p>The ending itself wasn't <em>bad</em> per se,  it's just that the resolution happened offscreen.  The story basically jumped forward by a few years to when everything had already been resolved.  Thematically the events that took place <em>would</em> have been a great ending... if the readers had seen them.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Yeah,  I doubt they made a conscious decision that there would be no Babs; it's just that they didn't have any reason to bring her back. Which is unfortunate,  but it could be worse.  At least we're getting a Rarity episode.

<p></p>Dragon Ball Z is pretty much the prime example of having way too much <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> in a show. It was far less of a pain to just read the manga,  as it didn't overdo things for the most part. At least the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> in the original Dragon Ball was funny.
