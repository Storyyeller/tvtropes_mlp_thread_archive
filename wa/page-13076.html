            because nobody ever told me what was going on,  you're all getting another fanfic report!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Dear Thread Manor...
<p></p>only 3 stories today,  but there's a theme this time! and that theme is changelings! What ind of stories do our favorite little shape shifters have for us? Lets see!
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/25149/thrown-abroad">Thrown Abroad<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Chrysalis,  looking for a scapegoat,  blames the entirety of the failed Canterlot invasion on a single changeling and banishes him from the hive. He finds himself outside Ponyville. Unfortunately,  our little changeling doesn't even have enough love in him to shape change into pony. No matter,  ponies are stupid creatures,  he should be able to infiltrate the town just fine,  even without shape changing! <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
<p></p>A fairly simple story,  well worth a read. Has a sequel,  though I have yet to read that one.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/43311/interview-with-a-changeling">Interview With A Changeling<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> -in progress. After the failed invasion of Canterlot,  Shining Armor has a serious hatred against changelings,  both for what they did to his country and what they did to his wife. Now,  a week later,  a lone changeling in his natural form approaches the gates of Canterlot with a white flag. He claims to be from a different hive than the one that attacked Canterlot,  with a different queen ruling over it. Now that the existence of changelings is public knowledge,  this new hive wishes to open diplomatic relations with Equestria. Can Shining Armor put aside his not so irrational hatred of changelings and give peace a chance?
<p></p>Yep,  a specieism story. SA is a racist! He actually has a reason for it,  but still. I recommend this story.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/48803/my-little-behemoth-friendship-is-more-than-food">My Little Behemoth: Friendship is More than Food<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Using fell magics,  Queen Chrysalis changes a simple worker changeling,  Cys,  into a changeling behemoth,  a changeling the size of a manticore. He can no longer fly or shape change,  but has vastly increased physical and magical capabilities to compensate,  including a full on invisibility spell. The problem is,  Cys never asked for this and hates Chrysalis for what she's done to him,  and for iron hold she has on him forcing him to serve her. Fast forward to the Canterlot invasion. Cys is incapacitated by Princess Luna,  and due to his size is not blasted out of Canterlot by the love bomb. In deciding his punishment,  Princess Celestia learns that he never wanted to be here,  and actually did his best to not severely hurt anypony. Tia decides on his punishment: community service in Ponyville.
<p></p>This was a neat story,  but I felt that it ended a bit too fast. Still definitely worth a read though.
<p></p>That's all for now,  see you all next time!
<p></p>Your Faithful Fanfic Reader,

            It's addressed inside the fic. Apparently that particular changeling wanted to see the guy who killed three quarters of a hive with their own food in person.

            Even still,  you'd think there'd be someone better - he might be a Prince <em>now</em>,  but he wasn't raised nobly. Does Equestria not have any actual ambassadors? I know it's his home country,  so it would be the duty of the prince top receive foreign ambassadors,  but like... couldn't Cadence do it? Or the actual rulers?

            @Blissey: That... makes even less sense then. Does he show up in disguise or something?

            Traditionally,  the view is that Rarity gets the best episodes. I have assumed this to be true for a long time. Then,  the spoiler thread prompted me to actually take a look to see if I really felt that way about the episodes. I amazed myself to find that I actually preffered Fluttershy episodes. I doubt that this will be a popular opinion,  but opinions? Has something similar happened to any of you?
<p></p>EDIT: Charisma drain is probably the most representative.

            White Flag would make a good pony name.
<p></p>And no,  the only Fluttershy episode I really like is Stare Master. Rarity is just so obviously better.

            Fluttershy's episodes are pretty solid,  but on the whole I think Rarity's edge them out.  Doesn't help that there's an overlap (Green Isn't Your Color).  The other thing is that I feel like a lot of her best episodes were carried by other characters; a lot of my affinity "Hurricane Fluttershy" is the result of how Rainbow Dash was handled,  and Iron Will pretty much made "Putting Your Hoof Down".  Heck,  even "A Bird In the Hoof" was largely entertaining because of Philomena.
<p></p>Not that Fluttershy was badly written in those episodes (she wasn't),  but I find she's also not the main draw of the episode either.   Basically,  the Fluttershy episodes are comparable in quality to the Rarity episodes,  but the Rarity episodes are good because of how Rarity is written in them,  whereas the draw of the Fluttershy episodes often come from other characters.

            Well,  I'm one of those poor,  crazy souls who actually likes all the episodes(Or at least,  there aren't any I think are out-and-out bad),  but honestly... very few purely Rarity-centric episodes blew me away. Dog and a Pony show was pretty good,  but on the whole I simply prefer duo or trio episodes... which is why I tend to really enjoy the CMC episodes,  because they have the most consistent dynamic.
<p></p>As for single episodes... I actually most consistently like Pinkie's solo episodes,  actually. I find her to be a really fascinating character when she gets proper focus,  and I find her much funnier when she's allowed depth to her personality rather than JUST being there for jokes. So,  as a rule,  I tend to really enjoy her focus episodes.

            Pinkie's solo episodes are usually pretty good as well. I really wish they could incorporate more of that depth into ones where she's just a supporting character.

            There's just no time for it. Her issues are the kind that simply don't show up unless she's put into a personal crisis. Putting Your Hoof Down is probably the only one that does that when she's a secondary character.

            I'm not to fond of Rarity episodes to be honest. I far prefer her when she isn't being focused on.
<p></p>My favourite episodes tend to be Rainbow Dash ones. My top two episodes are Sonic Rainboom and Hurricane Fluttershy after all.
