            There was a lot more behind the Derpy thing than <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>. Primarily,  the voice actor had been misinformed about Derpy's gender,  and her performance had to be altered in post-production to make it sound more gender-neutral,  so she wanted to give a proper performance with an appropriate voice. The removal of the name was just a prudent step considering that if the writer had known the origins of the name,  she wouldn't have used it in the first place.
<p></p>Derpy has since then been embraced by Hasbro in all of her cross-eyed glory,  and appearing on tons of official merch. She's not going anywhere,  considering that she's practically the show's mascot at this point.

            That still doesn't sound like justifiable reasons to just change the scene to me. The scene,  in its original form,  is loved by most of the fanbase. To just go and change that is ridiculous just because one or two of the makers weren't happen with it. What origin of "Derpy". It just means "to make a mistake" and that's what the clumsy pony does.

            I rarely am wrong. Besides,  I have no reason to trust a production team that's shown me that they're willing to change something that people generally liked just because one or two people complained.
<p></p>I don't let things go,  Pannic. Forgiveness is a weakness.[/joking] The point is,  they were willing to change "just one scene" because there were complaints. Any other scene could be next.

            Yeah,  given that after the whole Derpygate incident Hasbro... went ahead and made a limited edition Derpy toy specifically to cater to the fans.  Yeah,  I don't read that as sacrificing the artistic integrity of the show.  Honestly,  the only part of the edit that bugs me is that they underped her eyes,  because that was largely the whole reason she was popular in the first place.  But seriously,  other than that,  her character is intact; they just gave her a voice they found more fitting and removed the name because it could be considered a slur (and keep in mind that this is a show that had trouble using words like "loser" and "egghead").  Yeah,  it's an overreaction,  but I really don't think it's that big of a deal.  If they had removed her <em>entirely</em>,  then yeah,  but given that she still pops up in official stuff I doubt it'll affect the quality that much.
<p></p>Also,  if you're going to complain about season 3,  at least watch it first to see if your worries have any basis.

            Dude,  it wasn't quick. That happened months after the fiasco. Besides,  if you even bothered to keep up on Season 3,  you'd have remembered that,  at the initial con announcement,  they aired a voice clip of Spike saying,  "Hey,  it's Derpy!" before airing the "Wasn't prepared for this" song.
<p></p>The fact of the matter is that Hasbro is aware of and is doing as best as they can to step around the issues regarding Derpy,  and are now in a comfortable position to put a bit more focus on her.

            Dude,  three episodes after Derpygate,  we had Big Mac and Cheerilee wake up in a daze on a feather bed in a dark pit with one of them wearing a bridal veil.  I'm thinking Derpygate was a bit of an anomaly.

            ...I seriously doubt that that was the motive behind it.  Really,  I think you're blowing the edit way out of proportion.  Literally the only content that was <em>removed</em> was her name,  and that was because the writer was unaware of the connotation.  Basically,  the edit wasn't made because people complained,  it was made because the writer didn't realize she had used a term that she wasn't comfortable with.
<p></p>@Nom: I don't think that was an official part of the episode; that was just somebody in the audience yelling.

            Or they're being smart and playing it sneakily by keeping as much of her in as they think they can get away with?  This type of stuff isn't exactly black and white.

It was their method of teasing the crowd while they were setting up the video clip.

            Which is missing the point that even <em>long after the edit was made,  they're still using the character</em>.  I think at <em>worst</em>,  Hasbro made a misstep,  fixed it as best they could,  and moved on.
