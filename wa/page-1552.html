            I'm pretty sure Fluttershy is an early bloomer,  it's why I don't put her as oldest like everyone else. when I saw her I didn't think "older than the rest" I thought "Shy awkward character that doesn't socialize,  let's give every reason for that to happen"
<p></p>And of course what can make a lass more insecure than suddenly becoming taller and ganglier than everyone else in your age group.

            What's all this "Trixie lost everything she owned" business? That little wagon was probably just an extremely extravagant "tent". You know,  a mobile stage for her to perform on when she's on one of her tours. Yeah,  it was probably expensive,  but come on,  a performer like her,  she's got to have a huge,  more permanent house.
<p></p>As for the theory that she used to be Celestia's student before Twilight came round,  I prefer a different theory. Specifically,  the theory that she <em>tells</em> people that to make herself sound more important.
<p></p>"Yes. That's what I'll tell them. Nobody will need to know that I've never even seen the princess in person."

            Ya know,  all this talk about pony ages and stuff has got me wondering:
<p></p>What do the guys in Equestria who have met the mane six think about them?  I mean,  I know they can't answer that question due to the show being for young kids,  but do you think the stallions,  say,  stare at Fluttershy's cutie mark whenever she walks by,  or something like that?  And in general,  since all the ponies seem to have the same build,  what exactly is their standard of beauty?
<p></p>I honestly think it would be interesting to see one of the mane six have a boyfriend.  Especially Pinkie Pie.  I wonder if she gets any attention at all,  or if most guys just don't even consider her,  either because they mistake her for a really big child,  or because they think she's got problems (though you'd have to wonder if somepony would look past that,  maybe because he likes curly tails or something).

<p></p>I hope the show does address it.  It could make for some cute and interesting story lines.  And if you ask me...Twilight should get a love interest somewhere down the line.  Relationships are like the next step up from friendships...advanced friendship as it were.
<p></p>And the thought of Pinkie having a crush on somepony is just too cute. <em>Especially</em> considering how enthusiastic she is about stuff. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">

That was not the exit of someone who had just had a major permanent loss. Yeah,  she'll need to buy some new supplies,  and a new wagon,  but I've got a feeling she can afford that.
<p></p>Trixie needs not your pity. She's a big girl,  and probably already has her next big gig lined up.

            I'm pretty sure that originally the ponies were supposed to have different body types,  but it got axed so it wouldn't create extra work for the animators.  Fluttershy and Rarity are the only ponies that have been treated as attractive in-show,  but other than that I got nothing.  It's my personal fanon that Pinkie Pie is chubby due to eating nothing but junk food,  but whether that adds or detracts is up to personal preference.

<p></p>I fucking HATE Romance. I thought I could use this show to ESCAPE Romance. I HATE LOVE!! (pant,  pant,  pant)
<p></p>What your basically saying,  Apple,  is that Romance TRUMPS standard friendships

            @Rich: We're not discussing humanizations,  so I don't think that that's going to come up at the moment.
<p></p>Anyway,  yeah,  I really don't think the show needs any romance,  and I don't think it would fit anyway.  Either the romance would fail to maintain the status quo,  or it would <em>work</em>,  and we'd have some random colt (there's no way the writers would do a lesbian pairing in the mane cast) shoehorned into the cast,  and that would really screw up the dynamic between the characters.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I think it's because that most shows that include romance tend to turn into a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Romantic Plot Tumor</a>.  It's basically ubiquitous in most media,  so it's kinda refreshing to finally find a series that doesn't include it.

            And the stuff about Rarity being able to get guys' attention gives me another question... just,  what exactly are pony male standards anyway?
<p></p>Like,  for example (and I hate to use this example,  but I can't think of a cleaner one),  what would the pony equivalent of a porno magazine be like?  I mean,  they already live in a world where everyone walks around naked.
