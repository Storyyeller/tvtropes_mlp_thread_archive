<p></p>@ Sky: Maybe there's a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain">King in the Mountain</a> thing going on. The Emperor is an ancient Golem (Diamond?),  one of the first,  but now he's effectively a statue on the throne until a threat emerges that he must combat.
<p></p>Perhaps the Changelings?

            @Badwolfwho  I'm not interested in that kind of crossover. (However Ponies instead humans can fix extremely annoying fraction what humanity is in ME). My idea is  something like Fallout Equestria (or even more fusion fic) where all ME races are replaced by MLPFIM races.

            @ginger  Maybe you should try games where PC is less powerful like war FPS or  similators (especially Space Sims where you no match to big ships).

            @Sky: I'd prefer that he has color changing abilities rather than being rainbow colored.  He'd be too fabulous.  Or maybe he could be the only colorless/semi-transparent golem,  while the rest are various colors or rock types.
