            Mio: Yea,  I think there's too much pride floating around with that regard.  I'm renting on my own,  but that mostly works because I got a good deal on the rent.  The market is kind of crazy where I live because the population is increasing,  but hardly anyone is building houses (all the provinces next door are paying contractors much better).  So I see rent on standard barely bigger than bachelor pad sized apartments running $1100/month and those who are selling places wanting $225 000 for a 570 square foot bachelor pad and wonder how anyone affords this without building a house of cards that collapses the first time a big financial issue comes up.
<p></p>Twi - would definitely not want to go back and take it pretty hard.  She barely knew the rest of the main six at the end of the second episode and the prospect of going back to Canterlot to study on her own made her pretty melancholy.
<p></p>Rarity - would have a fit.  She seems to have a pretty strict sense of what should be in her house and I have a feeling her family's habits would drive her up the wall.  Plus they don't seem to have a sense of taste or smell. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>Dash - would take it like a gut shot to her pride.  I think she'd try to play it down a lot and maybe even hide it from the others.
<p></p>Pinkie - would probably be pretty sad to leave all her friends behind.  And probably try something crazy and illogical like getting her family to move the farm to Ponyville. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>Flutters - would likely be more concerned about what would happen to all her animals than herself.  She seems to baby them a lot,  so sending them back out into the wild would be a grim prospect.
<p></p>AJ - hypothetically speaking,  I guess,  AJ would probably be the most fine with it,  given that she's very family minded as is.

It's not really even sexualized,  there just happens to be a moment of nudity.

            Fair enough.  Or maybe it should still probably be considered Granny Smith's since she's still ticking,  shouldn't it?  I guess either way it's the same difference and AJ seems totally fine with it all.

            @JT I'm still creeped out,  TBH. I don't have issues with people ogling human versions of cartoon animals,  but it becomes rather uncomfortable to me when a group of people start <em>talking</em> about it. Kinda hard to go with a simple "out of sight,  out of mind" policy regarding the stuff when that happens.
<p></p>As for AJ,  I do have to wonder if she or Big Macintosh wouldn't have already struck out and started their own families/farms/lives if they didn't have to stay home to keep the farm afloat and take care of Granny Smith and Apple Bloom.

            I dunno,  the way the Apple Family functions it doesn't seem as if they splinter off unless the family gets too big for some reason.  Like if Big Macintosh and Applejack each got married and started a family,  I could see one of them moving someplace else so the farm wouldn't be too crowded.

            @subject of living with parents: I still live with them myself,  but I don't really want to move away and they're fine with me staying as long as I need/want to.  And whenever I get a job (hopefully soon),  I still would live with them because then I would be supporting the family.  Then again,  I've NEVER lived away from my parents,  even in college,  so it's not like that's anything new for me.  And I get along pretty well with them anyway,  I'd say I'm friends with them,  probably on a more equal basis now that I'm older.  Reading about some of the problems other people here have with their parents makes me realize how lucky I am to have almost always been on good terms with my own,  especially to have parents who I can share this show with as well.  In my case,  the fact that I am very unlikely to find a romantic partner or have children of my own makes the question of "what happens when the family expands?" be much less of an issue.
<p></p>@subject of ponies living with parents: What if instead of them going back to live with their parents,  what if their parents came to live with them?  I could see that happening in an episode or two,  it kind of happened for a bit with Rarity but it might be interesting to show with some of the others (minus Applejack,  whose parents are most likely dead so far as I can tell unless the show says they're alive).  How would Pinkie's rock farm family adjust to living in Sugarcube Corner with her,  even just for a visit?  If Twilight's parents stayed with her and Spike would Shining Armor and Cadance come along too?  And we don't even know about Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy's families.

            I remember this one non-animated humanization that was basically a comic of that opening,  but with a clever hard cut to Pinkie camping out that let them avoid having to draw a nude panel.  The best part of it was the way the artist did Dashie's "WTF,  Fluttershy?" face.

            @JT The point still stands that at this point neither Big Mac or AJ <em>have a choice</em> in leaving the farm or not. Applebuck Season demonstrated that it takes both of them to run the place without resorting to charity. Once Apple Bloom is older,  maybe <em>one</em> of them could leave,  but that's still just one of them.
