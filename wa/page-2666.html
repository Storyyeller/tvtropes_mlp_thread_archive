            I suppose. What if it were simply a skill gained through being alive for thousands of years? People do get cleverer as they get older,  so assuming she isn't senile she'd just keep getting more and more clever,  and eventually hit a moment of... well,  chessmaster level base intellect. Other gods might not reach it because there was no need. Discord,  for example,  for all his power never struck me as a particularly advanced chessmaster. He's always got his powers on back-up,  so he doesn't <em>need</em> his plans to work. If Celestia tried to brain-fuck Fluttershy,  she'd have done it with no problems at all.

            Would the reaper of ponies still wield a sicle? Or would they have a different cultural connotation for him,  like he wields a quill to write the last moments of their life in their book of life,  or something.
<p></p>In a way I almost find that more frightening that a scythe. Just some ambivalent,  cloaked figure,  writing patiently in a book... and then he <em>SNAP</em>'s it shut,  and you die!

            @kegi I think she's reached the plateau of High-Chessmaster by this point (I personally think she was always smarter than Luna anyway though)
<p></p>However,  I do NOT think that she's perfect. I think that now that she's reached this level of Chessmasterdom she just can't stop. She's locked in her own game and is physically incapable of relaxing completely. I think that this causes her a lot of mental strain

            i agree she's pretty much an expert chessmaster,  but not that she can't turn it off,  or that she's suffering from it. Pretty much all her games end up being for the betterment of her little ponies,  and there really is nothing that makes her happier then seeing her subjects happy. the few times she's around the Mane 6 while not in a crisis she seems fairly relaxed,  and we've seen her sense of humor.
<p></p>Though again that brings up the HILARIOUS image of Luna forcing her to take a vacation and her having no idea what to do.

Goes off to some place where she can unwind and not have to worry about what she says. Heh. Now I'm imagining a sort of spa for gods and goddesses.
<p></p>I also like to imagine that her chessmaster isn't absolute. She isn't completely infallible,  and can make a wrong guess when there's another factor she didn't know about,  or when one of the people she's trying to track is unpredictable in some way. in <em>Colour You Bleed</em> I give her a moment where she turns out to have been wrong about one of her plans because a subject of them went insane,  and she can't predict insanity.

<p></p>I see it as basically: Everything in Equestria exists because of her subtle machinations. She said the right thing,  at the right time,  and something happened. Now she knows that saying the wrong thing (even if it's only subtly wrong) could end up ruining everything. She can see the seems in the world she's laid the foundations for,  and now she's afraid of accidentally undoing it.
<p></p>I think seeing the ponies happy is one of the only things that gives her life any meaning. (oh,  and I think her sense of humour is carefully calculated as well)

            I heard a rumor that Pinkie's song is in episode 18. Then again,  the source of the rumor was the Youtube comment and the person never gave a source,  so I'm not giving it any credence.

            @kegi I don't think she'd be able to bring herself to leave. She may let her subjects solve their own problems,  but I still think that she wants to oversee them from a proverbial distance. Leaving Equestria sounds too much like leaving things to fate for Celestia <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
