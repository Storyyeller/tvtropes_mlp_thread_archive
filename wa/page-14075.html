            Well,  if we're speaking of Tolkien,  his languages and mythology are well defined so studying them is kind of justified. But the level of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding">World Building</a> he did is an insane feat and few can match it.
<p></p>As to the subpages,  I've had a mind to prune them for some time. Three separate fridge pages,  plus a redirect,  seriously?
<p></p>We even have a section for Pinkie's imaginary friends and other inanimate characters.

            @Mio: And that's fine. But I like to treat worlds of fiction as <em>actual places</em> that we're getting glimpses of and can study. If the author is just throwing things in on the fly,  that's fine. I can still bask in wonder of the created result.
<p></p>Also,  I'm a fanfic author and want my work to fit in with what's ben established about the setting (except for where I've deviated <em>deliberately</em>).
<p></p>And yeah,  part of me wonders why people are so resistant to the idea. Do people take Celestia being more powerful than them as a personal insult? Are they angry that she might be more powerful than their favourite character? Does ponies being powerful somehow make the show worse in some way?
<p></p>I've read mny fics where Celestia was clearly much weaker than I imagined her and I had no problem ith that. Neither did I have a problem with reading fics here she was clearly far more powerful than I imagined. Yet when I show whyI think they are at the poer level I imagine,  it's treated as a ludicrous claim. Okay,  yeah,  I'd also call it  ludicrous claim if someone called the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/PonyPOVSeries" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/PonyPOVSeries">Pony POV Series</a> power levels canon for example (despite having enjoyed the story), but that's quite a different thing.

<p></p>True,  but I s speaking of fantasy in general,  not just Tolkien. After all,  Tolkien decided not to call Noldorin "Gnomish" despite his originl plans.

            Would it be alright removing the folders in the character pages and combining tropes from them with other examples in the page to prevent repetition? The pages easily devolve into stating the same thing many times to make the characters seem more impressive then they actually are. You could make a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrinkingGame" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrinkingGame">Drinking Game</a> out of how many times the Fluttershy page hypes her up as  a badass over the Dragonshy or Discord incidents.

<p></p>I don't see why. Okay,  yeah I would say that I think that the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/PonyPOVSeries" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/PonyPOVSeries">Pony POV Series</a> power level seems a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement">bit much</a> based on what the show has given us (admittedly,  there Celestia,  Luna,  Discord and Cadance are currently limited by being in their mortal avatars and Cadance has lost her memories of how to use her OMGWTFBBQOVERPOWERED powers,  but still) thoughI still admit that I can't really say that it's <em>impossible</em> that that's hat we're working with. (Plus it allows some cool stuff. And it's kind of hilliarious to think of Cadance as more powerful than Haruhi).

<p></p>It's more powerful than the beam she could produce. Which,  assuming I'm right about the Sun,  is more than 100 times what's required to blow up the sun. So ... if that's hat you want to call "not taking a hit",  fine.
