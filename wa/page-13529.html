<p></p>A crystal headdress.  I can think of no ways that arranging sharp rocks next to your skull could <em>possibly</em> go wrong.

            Rarity did not anticipate that the headdress directions were written by King Sombra.  It's just 600 lines of "GRAAAHHHHH CRYSTALSSSS" over and over.

            So...Rainbow Dash just abducted a filly during the announcement.  And the giant phallic castle ejaculated rainbows.
<p></p>Okay,  so the episode was decent,  but the ending was more of an asspull than usual.  I mean if the inspector's beef is that she gets unusual and biased treatment,  why is she suddenly taking the unusual and biased opinion of the pony who got mistaken for her while she was having the worst day ever and getting drenched by random passersby?
<p></p>I do like the ending being the bit from the previous episode though — for a viewer who hasn't seen it yet it's kind of a WTF moment.

            <div class="quoteblock">Also,  oh,  I guess Rarity's parents really did have faith in her abilities,  even from a young age. Even if they aren't really into fashion; I can't deny that they allowed her to pursue her dream to its fullest extent. They also must have been pretty accepting of her attempting to be high class,  with all its affectations and such; even though it's a far cry from their lifestyle. Now that I think about it,  that's some pretty darn good parenting. </div>

            Have we even seen or heard about Fluttershy's parents?  I mean at this point her parents are about the only <em>complete</em> unknown left now that this episode at least conclusively showed that Dash is in fact not a magical lesbian spawn,  which wasn't really in question but was funny to think.

            Yeah. We know that Twilight's parents are around,  Pinkie's are hiring downtrodden stage magicians for their farm,  Rarity's are embarassing,  Rainbow's father was around at some point in her childhood,  and that Applejack's parents are never home and were never really in her life,  to the point that Applejack's stopped hoping that they'll come around for the next reunion.
<p></p>But we know nothing about Fluttershy's past.
