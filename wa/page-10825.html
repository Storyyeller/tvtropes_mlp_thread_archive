            Season 1 came out October 10. Season 2 came out September 17.
<p></p>Projecting the trend (that doesn't actually exist since we only have 2 points of data) puts Season 3 at about the 24th.

            @JT: Twi's parents are likely to be civil servants or lower-ranked nobility,  possibly with property but not land (Or at least not more land than their possible mansion). Birth rank,  minor noble.
<p></p>She's the Chosen Faithful Student of Princess Celestia,  so she's also a Royal Scholar and Celestia's protege. Notice that the guards never seem to be bothered by her presence in supposedly high-security areas of the Castle and Library,  and Celestia was all too happy to let out a room to Rarity and even give access to the large Ballroom for various birthday celebrations.
<p></p>Her brother is essentially Captain of the Guard and married to a Princess,  so she's in-law to Cadence (elevated to higher nobility by marriage). The guards are probably sometimes thinking "Oh,  it's Captain Shiny's little sister. She here to meet him today?"
<p></p>As of the S3 pilot,  Cadence will be undertaking a campaign to reclaim her rightful ancestral throne of the Crystal Kingdom,  so Twi's rank will rise even further,  especially if Cadence personally requests her to help. (Consultant/Historian for the Crystal Kingdom? If Dashie helps out just to fill her Daring Do fangirling,  she might also become a Royal Archeologist for the Crystal Kingdom :D)
<p></p>Rarity might get jelly,  but she's probably happy enough being best friends with Twi and she's already a Royal Dressmaker (having made Cadence's wedding dress).
<p></p>Furthermore,  as bearers of the Elements of Harmony,  the Mane Six in general are already titled and have pretty high security clearance when it comes to dangers to Equestria.

            I just find the idea amusing that some of them might have these really ridiculous official titles,  but none of them really care and don't even realize just how high up the social ladder they actually <em>are</em>.

            I doubt any of them have any official titles (well Twilight might),  but since they are so favored by Celestia they might as well in some cases.

            @JT To be fair,  the majority of the ponies high up on the social ladder don't know how high the mane six are on it,  either. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            Twi apparently doesn't know how much red tape most ponies need to wade through to rent rooms in Canterlot Castle for events,  and she can just get the ballroom for her birthday party just by asking the Princess <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>Dashie wants to get into the Wonderbolt on her merits as a skillful aerobatics expert,  so she'd shy away from using any titles to get in by the back door.
<p></p>Rarity probably is the only pony of the Mane Six who really takes full advantage of her title to help her business connections,  and she's probably quickly learning more about handling herself in high society from socializing with Fancy Pants.
<p></p>AJ,  well,  she probably doesn't need the title,  except to maybe brand some of her best apples to justify premium pricing.
<p></p>Fluttershy <em>probably</em> doesn't want too much attention in case somepony remembers her as that amazing supermodel who used to work with Photo Finish <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            I think they might be considered minor nobility <em>now</em>,  as Shining Armor is technically a prince,  and Twilight has saved Equestria on multiple occasions,  but yeah,  there's no real indication that they were particularly high on the totem pole to start with.

            There's really not much reason to think that they were really nobility before SA got married. They probably have some status,  though,  otherwise they wouldn't have been able to get a hoof in the door for Twilight to be tested for private schooling.

            What if: Mrs Sparkle was the author of the Daring Do series? it would explain how Twi got her hooves on a misprinted-cover edition of Griffon's Goblet.
<p></p>@JT: True that,  although at the bare minimum I expect Mr Sparkle has a cushy Civil Service job.`
