            Hey,  I'm still cautiously optimistic about the whole thing. Being ponies isn't what makes me like the characters. Even if I find the setting fascinating.
<p></p>Oh,  I didn't say anything about the episode. Mostly becase I generally agree with everyone else. Though Twilight's neuroticism is part of what I like about her. She's coming dangerously close to switching with Fluttershy for best pony for me.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I did that too! (Mostly for Pinkie though.)
<p></p>The problem is that can't be reconciled with the existence of long distance transportation like trains. Cartoons require you to employ Doylist thinkign in order to maintain versimilitude. </div>
<p></p>... Seriously? Long distance transport is still nescessary for the same reason that it was despite the fact that a third of the population can fly and the fact that teleportation has been canon since episode 2. Even if the number of teleporters was large (which I don't think it is),  that still wouldn't cover everypony,  still wouldn't guarantee they can take anything with them and still wouldn't guarantee that they can go anywhere they want anytime they want. Just restricting it to routes you know personally guarantees that teleportors <em>need</em> transport.

            I do agree that if its real and Hasbro is serious about this,  why associate My Little <strong>Pony</strong> with an IP that...does not have ponies? Is it some weird form of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">Wolverine Publicity</a>? Why not make an entirely new franchise to market the young teen girl crowd?
<p></p>Hasbro wants more people to get into My Little Pony,  and they do so by removing the Pony? Its really bizarre,  which is why I do have my doubts about that "screenshot".

So the logical thing <em>would</em> in fact be to take out the ponies and the other fantastical elements and give them something more familiar,  like High School.

            Arg. I like how,  in the show we have now,  it's implied that the characters are all adults. Rarity runs her own business,  Twilight's a grad student,  and etc.
<p></p>Turning the dial back to high-school age really changes the dynamics,  and I don't think it's necessarily in a good way.
<p></p>Like,  how much of Rarity would really survive the change? Worst-case scenario is that her passion for making clothes would turn into a fascination for <em>buying</em> clothes,  like the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fashionista" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fashionista">Fashionista</a> archetytpe that Faust was intentionally trying to avoid with Rarity's character.

            @ Seraph: Actually,  I am genuinely curious.  I took another step away from the fandom for awhile due to some family troubles,  but I hope to be around a bit more.  I have heard about the C&D against Fighting is Magic,  but haven't been up to date on much else fandom-wise lately.

            @Drenius: It hasn't been confirmed,  but it's quite possible the tv movie is a High School AU featuring the cast as humans.  I'd explain why that might cause a stir,  but I don't think it's necessary.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">That's actually my primary worry. One of the things I really liked about the original show is that it avoided talking down to the audience by giving the cast a maturity level that allowed them to be relatable for viewers of any age.  Putting them in high school narrows that scope quite a bit.  If you're <em>in</em> high school it could work,  but as somebody who's been out of it for quite a few years it's hard,  because my main memories of high school are basically "holy crap was I an idiot".

            Hm..  Yeah,  I could see why some folk might be a bit concerned with a high school AU with the cast recast as humans.  Personally,  while I''m not thrilled with the directions the possible movie could take,  I'm going to try to withhold judgement for now.

            Hi!
<p></p>Did people here like this last  episode?
<p></p>As my personal policy,  I'll avoid to criticize it. Let me just say I liked they did two simultaneous episodes,  something I only saw before in comic books! :)

            Haven't caught the last two episodes of the show for various reasons,  but I find the concept of parallel episodes pretty interesting,  so I'll have to catch up.
