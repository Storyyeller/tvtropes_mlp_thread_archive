            @Sereg: I remember being terrified of monsters when I was younger (Let's just say Fluttershy's panic attack in Hurricane Fluttershy brought back bad memories of a freaky ghost story I'd rather stay buried in the depths of my mind). Nowadays I realise that humans are perhaps more terrifying and dangerous than most demons,  like myself,  with the knowledge of weapons that can glass planets and nanotechnologies that can infiltrate and infest everything and bend it all to your will,  and the cunning to stack spell upon spell upon effect to turn a few simple magic items into game-breaking killer comboes (Anymug and Bag of Holding exploits come to mind in particular). Also I have no idea how you could get your hand possessed because I have honestly never encountered anything that would only be able to root your hand.

            Yeah,  that sounds right to me too.
<p></p>I <em>have</em> heard an argument that a pedophile could go for someone who is legally adult but has distinctly childlike aspects (its similar to the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">Really 700 Years Old</a> trope) but I've always considered that view a load of horse shit.
<p></p>It makes me wonder if pedophilia even <em>exists</em> in Equestria though (and if so,  how many fans think Celestia is one...)

            @Yeller: It's a magical mug that can create any non-magical fluid you are familiar with for whatever reason. How about splashing some nasty with Chlorine Tetrafluoride?

            Personally I've always headcanoned Pinkie as being physically an adult but mentally a ten-year-old girl.  One of my "Season Three Episode Ideas" involved her getting a glimpse into the future and seeing the man she will eventually marry,  and she's just so totally unprepared for marriage that she ends up avoiding men.  As an extension of that,  my headcanon Pinkie probably doesn't even know about sex,  or if she does it scares her silly.

            @Stevebat: I would have statted it for two-stage damage,  one stage being the massive green fireball,  the second stage being the damage traces,  in line with the game mechanics from regular Doom and Doom 2. Critting would result in fortitude saves against disintegration from massive damage.
<p></p>@Crowlover: Those are relatively easy to kill,  such that Red had to invent the Knight-class Demons for the Kaikin Ward RP.

<p></p>I actually had once drafted a fanfic where Twi does <em>precisely</em> that.
<p></p>Also,  I used to extensively ship Twi and Pinkie... which considering my headcanon is all sorts of weird.
