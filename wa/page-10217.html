            Okay,  for an idea of how quickly they are currently moving,  I checked the times between the post at the bottom of page 26000 and the one at the bottom of page 27000.
<p></p>That spanned 21 days,  22 hours,  11 minutes,  and 37 seconds.
<p></p>So,  assuming that's typical speed for them,  they have a speed of about ... 1140 posts per day.

            Geeze,  5 pints and Jaeger in that amount of time?  You sure made a night of it,  then.  Oh,  he's going to working at the Epcot Center?  That's cool!  I'm guessing you made it home safely though.

            Sorry for the long wait. Took me a while to type this up.
<p></p>So,  the story of my cutie mark. As you know,  I love space. I love the stars,  the planets,  the constellations,  etc. I knew when I was a colt that I wanted to learn about space. I would stay up as long as I can just to see the stars. This annoyed my parents greatly since they were pretty strict about a curfew.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>Anyway,  cut to the start of Foal Flight Camp. I remember telling my friend,  "With my parents not putting me to bed all the time,  I am going to stay up all night looking at the stars." My friend found that funny and said that he would swim in the lake all night. Needless to say,  he didn't get far with that and got a thorough scolding and the rest of us were warned not to wander out at night.
<p></p>Being the annoying jerk that I was,  I ignored them. When the counselors stopped checking to make sure we were all asleep,  I snuck out of my tent. Thankfully,  the sky was clear and I saw a low hanging cloud drifting in the wind. I flew up and took the cloud and spent a good chunk of the evening gazing at the stars. With no light pollution to hinder my viewing,  the stars looked amazing!
<p></p>When I felt that I got my fill for that evening,  I flew back. Almost immediately I realize that I was nowhere near the camp. Yeah... that cloud continued to drift in the wind. My instincts kicked in and I was like "I'll find the north star,  that'll take me back." I scanned the sky and realized that <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">I didn't know where the north star was.</a> Keep in mind,  at the time,  I was learning about the zodiac constellations.
<p></p>As you can imagine,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderStatement" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderStatement">I panicked.</a> I was scared out of my mind. I scanned the stars again hoping that I might remember where the north star was. In that time,  I saw Orion. Seeing it somehow made me calm down. I guess it's because it was the first constellation that I could readily pick out. I thought to myself,  "I'll follow the direction of the shield. That'll take me back." I realize just how stupid of an idea that was. At the time I didn't realize the numerous ways that could have backfired. Thankfully through dumb luck,  I found my way. I remember smelling the smoke of the campfire and I soon found the camp ground. I snuck back in my tent went straight to sleep.
<p></p>On the next day,  when I was making my bed,  my friend noticed that I had a cutie mark. It most likely happened when I saw Orion that night. Proud of my mark,  I went around and showed it to everyone. The counselors inevitably asked how I got it. Too caught up in the moment,  I told them everything. When I realized what I did,  my heart sank,  knowing that I would get scolded,  then I started to laugh. Seeing their faces mixed with frustration,  dumbfoundedness,  and amazement was a sight to see. I got scolded just like my friend,  but I didn't care. I was too happy.
<p></p>Anyway,  there's my cutie mark story.
