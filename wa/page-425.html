<p></p>^Exactly.  None of the non-magical carnivorous animals show any sign of violence toward smaller animals or ponies... maybe <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">there's a nonviolence spell cast within the borders of Equestria<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">?

            On the subject of crimes and murders; there are plenty of shows that take place on Earth,  in the "real" world,  where we know such things happen,  but crimes are never really mentioned.  It's not exactly because it contrasts with the tone,  it's more because that's simply <em>not what the show is about</em>.  Ponies have been shown to be able to use weapons and tools,  and be able to feel things like fear and jealousy (and prejudice,  that's a big check) so they're definitely capable of being <em>motivated</em> to commit crimes.  And royal guards wear heavy armor; why would armor even have been invented in a society that would never have any use for it?
<p></p>Also,  Twilight sure was scared of the snakes.  If nonmagical animals never prey on ponies,  how would that fear have developed?

            ^^I'm using the word to describe creatures that have historically been mythical on Earth,  like hydras,  phoenixes and dragons.  I just want to differentiate them from creatures that we know what's considered natural behavior for,  like chickens and stuff.
<p></p>^You raise a lot of good points (about the snakes,  too).  Like I've said,  I've been grasping a bit on the issue,  so I concede to your evidence.  I still doubt the practice of mutilation,  though; Equestria must have borders,  and I imagine Celestia isn't averse to banishing cases that won't respond to imprisonment or corrective education.

            Even if violent crimes like murder are less common in Equestria,  surely there are cases where one pony has killed another by accident.  Hell,  Derpy nearly killed Twilight with all that crap she dropped on her.
<p></p>As for other creatures,  the hydra certainly seemed willing to kill,  and that dragon had no problem trying to roast Spike.

            Celestia probably does banish people when she absolutely has to (yeah,  see <span class="strike">Luna</span> Nightmare Moon),  but Twilight's not a very good judge of her mentor's character.  She acts like the Parasprite swarm,  an event that (if it was anypony's fault at all) was an innocent mistake at worst,  will get the entirety of Ponyville banished or imprisoned,  when that's obviously not the case from the around two minutes of screentime Celestia had had in the series up to the point.

            ^That's one of the defining features of a hydra in most treatments of it,  but since the Hydra from "Feeling Pinkie Keen" never gets any of its heads cut off,  we don't know if it applies in this setting.  I would say it does.
<p></p>Actually,  yeah - we may not know what counts as 'normal' for Equestria and its world,  but even so,  creatures that can reform themselves from fire and creatures that can petrify others <em>have</em> to be classed as Magical creatures.  There's no getting around that.  Even in an explicitly magical setting,  certain creatures are viewed as magical.

Magic is both a common and neccessary force in Equestria,  so I'd still consider it "Normal"
