            Yeah... I'm with you,  Mage.  I mean,  it's a little ridiculous to be saying stuff like this when my entire exposure to the fanbase is this thread and Eq Daily,  but I just know the next Drawfriend is going to be full of poorly-composed drawings of Derpy with anime-style tears and blue cursive writing faded in at inappropriate points.

            Wow,  my tumblr dashboard just exploded. That's not a good sign. we're getting reports from both the apathetic and the emotional.
<p></p>Ooh,  here's a gem
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I’m not sorry to say this - but I honestly don’t give a fuck. In the end it’s just a cartoon,  not something that was intended to be taken seriously - ever.
<p></p>I don’t believe in fanons seriously,  never did,  my view on fanon is that it’s just something fun to play with but it should never be something to obsess over or treat like it’s the bible - that only ends in unhappiness.
<p></p>The show is THEIRS,  not ours. Always have,  and always will be - the best we can and should do is just enjoy everything they have to offer. That’s how I always enjoyed my cartoons and other things over the years,  I never demanded the creators do/change something to our liking - I just was thankful for what they gave. My view is that it’s their story,  let them tell it the way they want to. And if I get tired of it,  that’s okay - I just move on.
<p></p>Maybe it’s just me but the edit may have been the best move. Giving in to the fanon deliberately tends to be a bad idea in my personal view as it means the audience is controlling what creators do. (I know it’s not completely true but I just worry sometimes that could happen and the results will not always be satisfying to everyone involved). I wouldn’t want that to happen in my own works. (a little teaser there and here is fiine but making it so blatantly obvious is…usually not good). So,  It’s over,  they edited it,  so what? Just move on and enjoy what the future may have to offer.
<p></p>What people SHOULD be grateful about is the fact they kept the scene inact. That’s the most important part. Who cares if her name was removed or her voice changed? The whole story and character are still there - and that’s all that matters. The show is still good.
<p></p>Move on people,  in the end,  it’s only just a cartoon. Feel free to think what you want,  I just wanted to voice my own thoughts/suggestions. I’m not gonna try and change yours,  just making a statement.</div>

<div class="quoteblock">Anonymous asked: Anonymous because I don't want to make people mad. As my husband said,  this show is aimed towards LITTLE KIDS. The main reason why they fixed the eyes is because little kids ARE going to make fun of it,  and what happens when they see it in real life? They make fun of it. I know it's wrong,  and us adults do it,  BUT. The raw,  awful fact is that kids make fun of the special ed kids. And the name Derpy isn't REALLY a pony name,  anyway. It's kind of become a slur,  the word "derp",  implying mental —

<p></p>End of frikking discussion. Even us special ed kids said ‘derp’ when we messed up. For fuck’s sake it is NOT A GODAMN SLUR AGAINST RETARDED PEOPLE!
<p></p>SO EVERYONE. STOP SAYING IT IS! SPREAD THE WORD ON WHAT IT REALLY MEANS RATHER THAN APPLYING IT SO OFFENSIVELY TO SOMETHING WHEN IT’S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE!

            They may have been straight in other episodes but its the fact that they CHANGED an episode.  Nobody would have had a problem if they were underped from the get go,  Im pretty sure the fanbase would have welcomed the new voice if they'd left her eyes alone.

            Okay. Changing the clip is a bit silly,  but from a corporate standpoint is reasonable. They're covering their asses,  oh well.
<p></p>If the fandom at large is reacting like I've seen? <em>That's</em> stupid. Look,  it still doesn't make us the worst out there. The rage has been largely internalized from what I've seen,  the indignation may be flying but it's all within our boundaries. Actual outcry in the next few days is... probably inevitable,  and if Hasbro is smart all that will happen is that you'll have a collectors edition episode with Derpy,  and an aired version with Ditzy. Big deal. This has happened before,  I don't doubt.
<p></p>The only thing that really get's me about this is the sense of entitlement the fandom at large seems to have. She wasn't the derpy you wanted? Spack out! Hasbro covers their ass over people spacking out? Spack out! Did they ever stop to think what this means for the future? That Hasbro is going to be too afraid to do anything nice for fear of the fanbase spacking out?
<p></p>Okay,  now <em>I'm</em> over-reacting. Right,  that's my prediction. Two editions of the episode,  one with Derpy and one with Ditzy. I'm about to die in my chair; I'm going to bed. Night all.Hopefully this will have all blown over by tomorrow.

            <div class="quoteblock">it is the first time since the animators started intentionally doing so,  they were normal in the few episodes between the pilot and the episodes that were still enough in production to make the change to. </div>
<p></p>Actually,  her eyes were normal again in "Return of Harmony" and "Sisterhooves Social". Probably because she wasn't really doing anything in those episodes and was just crowd filler.
<p></p>But yeah,  this whole situation is weird. I don't want to <em>blame</em> Hasbro,  as they're giving us a Nightmare Moon and DJ Pon3 toy,  didn't force We Love Fine to censor their shirts,  and were alright with Derpy before. She even cameos in the Twilight Sparkle storybook app from a while back! That's <em>for</em> little girls,  mind you,  not us. And we know the show's staff are cool with Derpy.
<p></p>I doubt we're never gonna see Derpy with derped eyes again or anything so drastic,  but it does kinda make me wonder about future appearances. Are they gonna be toned down in Season 3?
