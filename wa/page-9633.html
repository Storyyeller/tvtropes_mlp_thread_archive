            The ponies only needed it to live because they failed to adequately check out the land they were settling on before doing so. It was still essentially theft of property. Not to mention that you have no idea whether or not that the "stupid tradition" was actually stupid or not.
<p></p>Of course,  the fact that the buffalo seem to have a sort of migratory pattern makes the mistake completely understandable,  and the buffalo should have understood that as well and sought a compromise rather than an all or nothing ultimatum.

There was absolutely zero indication that anything used the land,  and given that the buffalo apparently only show up for a day or two after a long stretch of leaving the land to itself.  The ponies were apparently there long enough to set up an entire town before the buffalo started bothering them.  Settling on land that's by all appearances completely uninhabited isn't theft.
<p></p>Also,  I'm watching more of the anthology and I'm <em>really</em> happy that there's a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dio" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dio">Rainbow In The Dark</a> reference.

            @Marston: I've heard.  So far it's pretty good,  although I feel like a lot of them are good ideas that are longer than they have to be.  Like the Shaft one; at first I thought it was hilarious,  but it was like twice as long as it needed to be to get the joke across.
<p></p>The "I WANNA ROCK" thing was hilarious though.
<p></p>And now I go to dinner.  Be back later.

            The buffalo are their own nation,  separate from Equestria. Even though they aren't large,  the ponies were still encroaching on their territory. Canada can't just waltz into Alaska and say "Hey,  you guys don't appear to be using this particular bit of frozen wasteland right now,  so we're going to go ahead and terraform it and start using it ourselves."
<p></p>Of course,  like you said,  the ponies had next to no way of knowing that the buffalo even roamed those parts,  and by the time it became a problem,  they were too entrenched to leave. Both sides had valid points.
<p></p>Anyway,  I'd love to continue the debate later,  but I have to go eat dinner.

            @Lurker: There is n evidence that the buffalo are a sepperate nation. Even if that were the case,  having a place to run when there's plenty of other space available is a far lesser need than the need for food and living space. To demand that others give up their homes as it's in your way is ridiculous.
<p></p>@CDRW: Fimfiction had some issues earlier. That might be why they're taking so long.

            To be fair,  2001 is incredibly long and tedious,  so it is a good parody.

            Admittedly,  the episode may have hit a different kind of cultural nerve in me due to the current state of my own country and the neighbouring country of Zimbabwe.

            I'm not a fan of 2001,  but I just don't think it dragged on that long. I will say though that it really didn't fit in very well. It would probably have been better off as an individual video.

            I really liked Flim and Flam. I can see why people don't,  but I loved them. Their song was fun,  they were deliciously slimy,  I love the fact that they were designed as identical twins...

            Dammit,  I don't want to agree,  but This Day Aria is one of those songs that looses most of its impact when you hear it without the accompanying footage. It's great because of the situation,  not because of the song itself. Like the Lord of the Rings soundtrack.
