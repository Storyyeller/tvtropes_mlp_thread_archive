<p></p>I’ve studied unicorn horns before. The magic runs along channels of reinforced keratin. The nervous system is not fully exposed. If it was,  filing horns would be extremely painful. I tried to duplicate the effects,  but it’s not easy and I was told not to try again.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> How the heck do one time spells even work anyways? Vancian Magic?</div>
<p></p>It depends. For example,  in some cases,  it would be roughly equivalent as channelling the spell automatically generates a blockage in the horn,  preventing the same spell from being cast. Whereas in other cases,  for example,  the object upon which the spell was cast acquires an immunity to that type of magic.

            @Ginger: I have the excuse that I have a book-reading appetite nearly as voracious as Twi's,  so much that only the Internet can sate my appetite for reading. Also I have been reading for over 20 years now XD Don't worry about being a slow reader,  no-one's giving out marks for devouring books within hours.
<p></p>@Star Swirl: Interesting. I'm wondering if your artificial horn has some kind of channeling design built in to allow magic to flow through it. If the magic got stuck in one spot on the horn,  an overload might have explained the explosion.

I think we're kinda spoiled on Twilight in that we forget that most unicorns are low-level magic users that only have one or two specific abilities. For all we know,  Doc Caramel's magic might have been limited to X-ray,  or diagnosis,  or something.
<p></p>So there may only be one or two unicorns with a spell that can actually <em>heal</em> with their magic,  and logistically speaking they should save their energy for ponies on the brink of death. Especially compared to a bones that apparently heal on its own in a week or two.

            Well Ace of Scarabs,  it's possible that I made an error in construction due to my own clumsiness which caused a blockage. Unfortunately,  that is not something easy to fix by myself.
