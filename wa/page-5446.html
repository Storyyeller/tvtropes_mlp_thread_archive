            I wonder if that was intentional.  The way Rainbow pronounces it really undersells the "me" and then Fluttershy is extra careful in her pronunciation.

            Most of them haven't been named yet because we're all so focused on the rather large amount of them that have canon names right off the bat. They did a really good job with that this week.

People always say that,  but they never actually do it. And if they <em>do</em> leave,  they're usually back within the next couple days.

            Anyway,  I'll try not to focus on that...
<p></p>Is Orion a fan nickname,  or was he named in the episode? I honetly forgot <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16"> A lot of people seem to like him though... I find him distinctly meh for some reason... I dunno,  I guess I just don't find him all that interesting

<p></p>I can think of a couple who left for good. But it's probably best not to dwell on the topic.
<p></p>Can anyone think of any funny topics for the Stalliongrad column? The only topic I can think of is the debt crisis,  but I'm not sure if that's appropriate.

<p></p>Yeah,  but he suggested for us to write articles for it.
<p></p>Anyway,  I'm pretty sure Orion is fan named. I imagine part of the interest is in his unusual design. He's a bit like the Ursa Minor and Luna.
