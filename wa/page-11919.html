            We don't really have any reference to judge how powerful the changelings are.  We only really see them in battle all of one time,  so it isn't exactly a good point to extrapolate from.

            Last post before I head off to my class.
<p></p>One of the common fan explanations regarding absence of Luna is that she was sleeping.
<p></p>I find this a little hard to accept; the wedding was going to be held at morning,  right? I am sure she would have wanted to,  or at least felt obliged to attend it as well. In that case,  she must have been awake during that time.
<p></p>Well,  that's my reasoning anyway.

            Regarding elite changelings,  we <em>do</em> see a few changelings wearing armor,  signifying at least some sort of rank. As for Luna,  an interesting detail is that during her initial cameo in the episode,  she enters Canterlot from outside the shield,  indicating that she spends her days elsewhere,  returning to guard the night.

            Luna was missing because she was worried about scaring all the ponies.  Luna's social skills are not very developed yet,  and at such a crowded,  important,  and emotional setting as a wedding...
<p></p>Cadence probably thought Luna would be able to handle it,  but "Cadence" would have liked nothing better than one less Alicorn to resist.  Luna may have had some anxiety before the wedding (about all the ponies,  and about the threat recently made against Canterlot),  and with "Cadence" to prey on that anxiety...
<p></p>"You don't want to crash my wedding,  do you?  Not in front of thousands of ponies.  Thousands of unpredictable,  partying spectators to pity you if you do something wrong.  Besides,  with Celestia at the wedding,  who will guard Canterlot?  Trust me,  Luna,  it's best for all of us,  especially you,  if you guard Canterlot instead of attending the wedding.  I'm sure Celestia will understand".

<p></p>More than the Changelings were?  I think that "scared shitless" boat had already sailed.

            My personal take is that they princesses didn't want to have all their eggs in one basket,  so to speak,  so Celestia and Luna decided to take watch in shifts.  I mean,  they have to sleep at some point,  and it has the bonus of keeping at least one princess available at all times in case one gets taken out somehow.  I mean,  yeah,  Luna didn't show up until after the fact,  but let's face it,  the whole issue got resolved pretty quickly after Chrysalis revealed herself.  I don't think more than a few hours passed between Chrysalis casting off the disguise,  and Cadance and SA blasting her.  Given that Luna probably isn't in Canterlot at all,  and it's doubtful that anypony managed to get out of the city,  it isn't that surprising that she didn't show up.
<p></p>Also,  keep in mind that both Luna and Celestia are totally unaware of the fact that 1. Cadance is a fake,  and 2. SA is being mindcontrolled.  They probably assumed something like "hey,  both Celestia and Luna don't need to be around because we have another alicorn princess as well as one of the army's best unicorns around for backup".  Celestia and Luna might not have ever thought that they'd need to fight one on one,  assuming that "one princess + Cadance + Shining Armor" would be enough firepower to handle most threats.  Heck,  that makes Chrysalis' plan even better; not only does she fly under the radar but she neutralizes two rather large threats to any invasion.

            So do I,  I'm just pointing out the reason that she's too far away for the invasion to wake her up.  Either that or she's just a really heavy sleeper.

            Eh,  it just seems like they didn't want to show both Princesses getting the beat-down for time and just left Luna out of it,  and also hung a lampshade on it.
