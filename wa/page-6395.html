            <span class="blue">@Ginger:It is a Deconstruction.  That doesn't mean it's realistic.  It just means that the internal logic of the show is much more consistent and thought-out than normal shows in it's genre,  which is very true.  It also means that the show eschews common tropes that are taken for granted in the genre which don't really make sense.  For instance,  in Magical Girl shows,  the main girls are just about always happy,  which doesn't really make a lot of sense because they've essentially become child soldiers with a hidden double life that alienates them from society.</span>

            Goodness you people post fast.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Why would I be worried about the tower? </div>
<p></p>Death represents great change,  while The Tower represents ruin. Also,  chaos,  crisis,  impact,  etc.
<p></p>It's not a fun card. See,  the imagery is of a tower being struck by lightning and splitting apart. The tower represents things that have been built up (perhaps on false foundations) being torn down.
<p></p>Fun fact: in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,  the astute among you may remember that Professor Trelawny found herself repeatedly pulling The Tower on the same night that the thing that everyone remembers from that book happened. In fact,  the chapter where it actually happens is titled "The Lightning-Struck Tower". Fun stuff.
<p></p>The last few cards in the deck follow an interesting progression. We have The Devil,  which represents temptation,  vice,  and obsession,  followed by the Tower,  representing crisis and ruin. A <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour">Darkest Hour</a> kind of thing. Then,  we get The Star,  The Moon,  and The Sun. Three cards of increasing strength,  each symbolising inner qualities,  and,  in two of them,  hope and joy. Then,  we have Judgement,  which represents rebirth and salvation,  and finally,  The World,  perhaps the most positive card in the deck.

            I mean,  Death isn't the <em>happiest</em> of cards: change can also mean loss as easily as it can mean new opportunities,  but The Tower is a far more ominous omen.
