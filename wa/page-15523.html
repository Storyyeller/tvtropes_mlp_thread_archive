            @Seraphem: There's nothing wrong with appreciating their artwork and I would totally go to their booths to pick up swag and whatever.  I just find the whole idea of "fandom celebrities" weird; as far as I'm concerned they're just other fans of the show who happen to be more well known than I am.  I mean,  it's awesome that they put out cool artwork and music or whatever,  but I don't see much reason to get worked up over them either.
<p></p>Of course,  it's probably the fact that there <em>aren't</em> any fanartists that I'm "a fan of every bit as much of as the show." There are certainly some great artists out there,  but I wouldn't say there's any fanart of the show that I enjoyed more than the source material; most of the fanwork I like I only like <em>because</em> of it's relationship to the source.

            Okay,  another example,  Silver,  my roommate.. the NON idiotic thieving,  asshole one... was inspired to start drawing again after a long time off by L'il Miss Jay,  and his art is good,  damn good,  but he's always very very self conscious and never thinks he's really that good. And had stopped again fairly recently for various reasons.
<p></p>You should have seen his reaction to both L'il Miss Jay AND Jitters both looking at his art and telling him it was great and to not stop doing it. I don't get how not being on the show officially,  makes a fan artist any less able to be an inspiration,  or an less someone worth meeting.
<p></p>OH And on the "official" part,  I got the talk with G.M. Barrow a bit,  met M.A. Larson,  AND got Katie Cook to sign my Derpy cover for issue one of the comic.

I don't see how it's any different then what the show staff do,  other then the staff get payed for it,  the fans simply sue to loving it.

            I'm not disputing that they're awesome at what they do,  I'm just saying that I personally don't find any of them <em>so</em> awesome apart from the ponies that I would be particularly worked up about meeting them.  There's a <em>huge</em> difference between making a popular original work that inspires tons of fanartists,  and the fanartists themselves who may very well be incredibly skilled,  but are only popular because they're creating fanworks of something that gives them a built-in fanbase.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I don't see how it's any different then what the show staff do,  other then the staff get payed for it,  the fans simply sue to loving it. </div>
<p></p>I do think there <em>is</em> a bit of a difference here,  namely that the people who created the show did so (mostly) from scratch and managed to be uber-popular,  whereas most fanartist are only well known because they draw pony art.
<p></p>Again,  it's not at all that they aren't amazing artists and that they can't inspire others. It's just that I find the original work to be an order of a magnitude more impressive because it managed to be bone-crunchingly popular <em>despite</em> not having a built-in audience.  Yes,  the fanart may be amazing and inspiring,  but I honestly don't think that 90% of pony artists would be half as popular as they are if they had never drawn any pony-related material.  However skilled they are,  they still owe their popularity to the show,  whereas the people who made the show don't owe their popularity to anyone but themselves.
<p></p>I'm not saying it's in any way bad to admire great fanartists,  but at the same time I have far <em>more</em> admiration for those who can create something and popularize it <em>without</em> having to attaching to something that's already popular.
