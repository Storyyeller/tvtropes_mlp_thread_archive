            @Kegisak: Yeah,  I doubt that dissection would be a worry.  At worst they might strap you down to take X-rays or maybe some CAT scans or something.  Maybe take a blood test.

            @Orion: Well,  I mean,  you wouldn't is the thing. We have technology that allows us to see inside of you without cutting you open,  as JT said. Moreover,  you're a sapient species. Something mindless,  like,  say,  a manticore,  might be in danger of dissection or experimentation,  but your knowledge is far more valuable to us. any tests you're likely to undergo fall under the purview of 'would you please run on this treadmill until you get tired while we monitor your heartbeat?" and "you would please fly for a while in this wind tunnel so we can figure out how you manage to get lift with those tiny wings?"

My priorities would likely be the following:
<p></p><ul><li> Avoid any contact with the protagonists if possible: Any interaction with them could end up like interacting with someone from the past,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">drastically changing future events as they unfold</a>. Plus I could risk damaging the boundary between this universe and Equestria.
</li><li> Try to get back to this universe: If only to avoid the above from happening.
</li><li> Avoid any other characters as much as possible: Because any attachment to this world would be detrimental to the above two (ironic,  considering I'm pretty attached to it as is)

No one wants that happening to them and I can assure you if those scientists mess with you then I'll give 'em what for! Cuz nobody messes with my friends,  especially you.
