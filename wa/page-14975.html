            About the idea that Applejack is secretly wealthy,  then why did she tell Twilight that her reason for going to the Grand Galloping Gala was because the farm REALLY needed money to fix things?  That would be a blatant lie if the family actually did have a lot of money.  If that was the case,  then I would be very disappointed in Applejack as the Element of Honesty for making up such a lie just so she could get the ticket to the Gala.
<p></p>Although,  maybe they do have more money than most residents of Ponyville,  but because the farm is so big,  most of their money HAS to go to sustaining the farm and so they end up not having much left over for luxuries?  Or maybe the family used to be wealthy but they lost a big part of their wealth over time?  Kind of like someone who is land-rich and money-poor?

They do seem to go through multiple barns,  plus the parasprite incident would have cost them a lot of money to fix the stuff the parasprites ate.

            I'd just assume that most of the Apple family's money,  whether they're secretly rich or not,  is tied up in financing the branch orchards and founding new ones.

            Wow,  I'm surprised the Applejack wealthy thing is still relevant.
<p></p>Well,  the idea behind her going to get money from the gala is that it <em>wasn't</em> necessary,  but acting like it was would direct ponies away from thinking she was rich - she doesn't want ponies to know she's rich in the same way Twilight kinda wanted to hide her magic in Boast Busters. Depending on her wording,  which I don't <em>quite</em> recall,  she may not have even been lying - if she said,  as I believe,  "I could use that money to...",  then it's true. Yes,  she <em>could</em> use that money to fix the plough and the roof and Granny's hip. But,  you will notice that she <em>didn't</em>,  because she didn't really make any money - but despite that,  those things still got fixed. Honesty is the best tool in the arsenal of a deceiver.

            @Kegisak: Still seems pretty deceptive though,  even though she was <em>technically</em> telling the truth.  She doesn't seem like the type who would try to get the ticket for that reason when she knows someone else wants it.

            Yeah,  that is true. But then it's hardly like she'd be the only one who kinda defies their element at times - Rarity's been known to be openly selfish,  as has Rainbow Dash,  Fluttershy's got serious anger issues and Pinkie is... problematic.
