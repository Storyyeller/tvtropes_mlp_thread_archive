            Okay,  now I'm chronologically confused,  does this take place <em>before</em> "The Best Night Ever" or is there another Gala coming up?
<p></p>Evidence for former:  Blueblood seems to know who Rarity is and leads her on.
<p></p>Evidence for latter:  Nopony else says "hey I bought this dress from you!" to Rarity.
<p></p>Something has been kind of jarring me lately.  In "The Best Night Ever" they made a big deal about how far away Canterlot is,  but lately it seems like they can just hop-skip-and jump there whenever they want.

            I dare say I couldn't think of a single bad thing to say about this episode. Great characterization of Rarity,  pretty good song,  lots of neat cameos,  and it didn't villainize the Canterlot elite. I guess you could find fault with the fact that the rest of the main characters had little presence,  but I thought it was 100% quality.

            Ok,  this episode was hilarious. I've smiled for so long that it hurts a little to not smile. Also,  is just me,  or are upper class ponies easily swayed. Seriously,  it takes just one upper class pony to like something and then it's suddenly well accepted.

            So,  what's the pony term for armcandy?
<p></p>Dear Pricess Celestia, 
<p></p>Today I learned an important lesson about watching live TV over a stream. It's nice to get to watch an episode as it is airing and be as up to date as everypony who gets the Hub. Unfortunatly the stream may experience some terrible lag leaving you staring at a stil image while the audio continues onwards. On the bright side you get to see commercials for inflatable remote controlled flying fish and games about a dog going poo.

            It seems like Jet Set and Upper Crust were the only Canterlot ponies who really were that stuck up.
<p></p>Still,  the amount of class going on there I have to wonder how Twilight turned out so humble? Especially because she seems like she'd be in a bit of a well-off position. I mean,  she's the princess's personal student. That's got to be worth something in the social circles.

            What?  Come on ginger,  she barely even did anything this episode.  I thought you were cool with Pinkie when she wasn't screwing things up or inexplicably knowing how to save the day.  All she did this episode was throw a party.

            In full agreement with Ginger. Awesome episode. Fancy Pants was great. The rest of the Canterlot Elite,  however,  can all take a Party Cannon to the face for all I care.

            The thing is I only think we saw the Canterlot nobility,  or "Blue blood" as it is.  The people that don't work for a living.   Twilight is a member of the Canterlot scholar society which may be totally different for all we no.

<p></p>I tend to theorize that nopony but those who were there knew about the whole Nightmare Moon thing.  They kept it secret so they could lead normal lives,  possibly also because Luna is trying to distance herself from the Nightmare Moon image.
<p></p>In all honesty lately I think I'm suffering pony burnout,  because even though I felt like I <em>should</em> like this episode,  I kept getting distracted or having my mind occupied,  so it didn't have as much impact on me as it should.  You know "Party Cannon" is gonna become a meme though.
