            Please do.  Spread the word.
<p></p>Anyway,  just hit the first commercial break for <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/S3E1" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/S3E1">S 3 E 1</a>.  I'm... kind of worried so far,  actually.  I don't know why Luna's so upset with Twilight,  and I don't like that hint of Ascension there.
<p></p>Edit: Hooray,  second song.  Hnngh,  I needed bouncing Fluttershy back in my life.

            I found a great comment on the video I'm watching:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">King Sombra was never designed to be a villain like Discord or Chrysalis
<p></p>Sombra is a ominous presence. It was a race against the clock to save the empire from having the same fate as before.
<p></p>I'm surprised so many people are hating on this episode. Sombra was a great Villain. Subtly is something that's often overlooked and apparently you all forgot about it as well.</div>

            <div class="quoteblock">Well,  they had a point with Sombra; he was roughly as dangerous as a bout of flatulence. His 'evil deeds' basically boiled down to inconvienencing Shining Armor and snarling. </div>
<p></p>And,  y'know,  brutal protracted slavery in a region that screwed with the emotional state of the whole country.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> I'm... kind of worried so far,  actually. I don't know why Luna's so upset with Twilight </div>
<p></p>I don't think Luna was actually pissed at Twilight,  really.  Just that she's usually pretty stern on the whole,  and her neutral-face looks a little uncanny.  I can kinda relate to that,  really â€” people think I'm pissed off about something pretty often when I'm usually just kind of spacing out and thinking about stuff or enjoying the music in my head. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>Just finished both episodes. Spoilers...
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Twilight is OP as usual.  Sombra went out like a bitch before there was an actual confrontation,  and appears to have been blown to pieces in a rather hindsight-disturbing way.  He had a cool set of gimmicks too; I kind of wanted there to at least be more than a few seconds of him fucking shit up and the other Manes taking him head-on,  instead of the line being held right up until the very end.  Then again,  he seemed to be a lot more balls-out DESTROY EVERYTHING than our previous villains,  so I understand why a fight scene may not have been feasible.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mixed feelings on the whole framing it all as a test for Twilight.  I realize Celestia knows that's a quick way to motivate the girl,  but she should also be aware that it's a hell of a double-edged sword.  I mean,  Twilight's Exam Mode seems to actually take priority over her Hero Mode.  On the other hoof,  it's an excuse for solo Twilight,  and it's kind of interesting to see how she's actually gotten badass enough over the course of the series to do that by now.  That,  and seeing her copy Sombra's general malaise spell was pretty awesome.</span>
<p></p>EDIT: f'ing a,  they took out superspoilers!

            Okay,  just finished it.  That was a good opener - not as good as the Wedding was a closer,  but still very good.  Sombra certainly lacked the personality of the other villains,  but I can appreciate him as a force rather than a character.  (Also,  his design was kind of silly,  so I'm glad he didn't get all that much focus.)
<p></p>Okay,  the book is worrying me,  though.  There are a lot of hints in this episode of an overarching plot,  which is fantastic,  but if it's Ascension... hm,  I don't know.
<p></p>At least Spike finally got a window!  And everyone continues to hit on everyone else.  There were gryphons at the library,  too...

            I'm hoping it's not Ascension.
<p></p>I think it's just more powerful magic. Twilight has shown she's able to use Dark Magic now,  and she knows advanced telekinesis,  teleportation,  object fixation,  enchantment,  and science.
<p></p>So maybe it's alchemy.

            @Enlong: They're just snotty jumped-up nobles,  they don't get the true meaning of the glasswork in Canterlot Castle. The actual council,  the Guards and the staff all know what's really up.

            I wonder what sort of Alchemy it'd be. I hope not FMA-style alchemy. Cool as it is,  you just <em>know</em> Twilight's he sor to think "That resurrection formula is just <em>incomplete</em>. I just know I can figure it out."

Like,  he knew who Rarity was the whole time,  and he went along with her little fib because he knew she needed a little... boost to get through the absolute pigheadedness of the other high-ups.
