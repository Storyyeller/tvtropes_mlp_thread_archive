            Yeah,  between the events of HWE and Discord's attacks,  any race-relation issues probably got sidelined.  There <em>might</em> still be some,  but I doubt it's very common.

            Well,  you'd imagine that racial slurs would have been common back then.
<p></p>And even today,  there's probably some stereotypes. After all,  some stereotypes are based on fact (only distorted and exagerated). And the average members of each tribe are obviously very different from one another.
<p></p>We know that at the very least they <em>used</em> to have stereotypes.

            @JT: clearly the rules for pony race genetics work very differently from XY gender chromosones.
<p></p>And yeah,  Lurker is right about the physical issues that might develop. I'm picturing a pegasi couple move their cloudhouse to a tall hillside tree,  and integrating a treehouse to their property so their Earth Pony Child has a reasonable ground to live on.
<p></p>For the Discord's reign thing eliminating the worst of the racial discrimination,  I pictured Discord reshuffling everypony's races so much nopony would remember who was originally what. In a way,  he might have <em>helped</em> them develop as a culture through that torment.

            Yea an earth pony foal born to Pegasi parents living in a cloud city would definitely be at a loss.  Maybe such foals are given up for adoption... or perhaps placed with distant relatives that live in an appropriate location.

            @Sereg: the stereotypes still kinda persist though,  the image of the Snob,  the Jock,  and the Hick is somehow surviving in modern Equestria. Mostly I blame it on silly ponies.
<p></p>@Orion: what,  did somepony play a telekinetic prank on you that went bad in school or something?
<p></p>Imagine how it would be if Scoot's parents were an Earth Pony and a Unicorn.

            There could be other complications as well. I wouldn't put it past places with primarily unicorn populations to have a penchant for doorknobs,  magically activated devices,  and other things that a non-unicorn wouldn't be able to operate,  and as we've seen,  earth pony parents would have a lot of trouble keeping their non-earth pony children safe and out of harm's way.

            @Blue The responsibility she hasn't been shown taking yet is responsibility for the impression she leaves on those who idolize her. If she does dangerous things as part of her training,  but doesn't take the time to make sure those watching her <em>know</em> that it's dangerous,  but that she's a professional who is qualified to do it,  then that's a bit irresponsible. The <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">Don't Try This at Home</a> disclaimer exists for a reason.
<p></p>I just think that her realizing that she <em>is</em> a role model,  whether she likes it or not,  and should act accordingly would make for a great lesson for her to learn.

            EP could always... as ghastly as it would be ... remove the things that identified their foal as another tribe... but thats probably too grimdark for Equestria.
<p></p>Paring down a unicorn's horn and fluffing up their bangs to hide it probably wouldnt be too grim though... so maybe just requiring the foal to always wear a garment to hide the wings... and literally tying down the wings to keep em from popping up or something

            An episode where Dashie and Scoots bond over stunts and learning to fly? I'm all up for that :3
<p></p>Dashie should learn something from it,  afterr even if she isn't a good big sister figure <em>now</em> doesn't mean she can't learn to be a better big sister.
<p></p>@Turtle: a hat would hide the horn just fine. You planning a darkfic about the Bad Old Days before Equestria was unified?

            @Blue: Yeah,  it isn't that she isn't responsible at her job; it's that she has to realize that by allowing (and encouraging) Scootaloo to idolize her,  she's also implicitly encouraging Scoots to do stuff that Scoots <em>isn't capable of doing safely</em>.  So basically what Perpetual said.  RD is responsible in certain things (like her job and her training),  but she might not realize that other ponies might try to imitate her and hurt themselves in the process.

            Hi Drenius,  i rerailed the thread because Slowpoke was getting tiresome. (and also because I could hear the some of a mod's Goldymarg shouting System Chaaaaaange!)
<p></p>Anyways,  such historical pre-Equestrian matters are interesting if really dark when you read between the lines and apply historical knowledge about Bad Old Days to the matter,  even with the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarBowl" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarBowl">Sugar Bowl</a> knob turned up high.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> When impressionable foals like Scoots are involved,  at least warn them not to try this at home because Dashie is a pro-tier Wonderbolts aspirant.

<p></p>That and I was always fascinated by early european history and I know how grimdark the REAL world was back then.
