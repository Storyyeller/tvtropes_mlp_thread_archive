            @Moe: I think the problem is that nobody else is seeing the same "trends" you are because they're wholly subjective in nature.  I mean "The other two parters were bad" doesn't really mean much when the vast majority of the fandom thinks that they were fine.  Not to say that you aren't within your rights to dislike either of them,  but it's not a good basis for trying to convince people that the finale could be problematic.

            @ad. Exact opposite for me. I like Tennant but the writing in his era was frequently mean spirited and lazy. There was good stuff but it was outweiged by the bad stuff.
<p></p>Matt Smith's era,  on the other hand,  is shaping up to be one of my favourite TV shows ever.

            <div class="quoteblock">@Moe I'm not attacking you. I'm honestly curious an looking for discussion. Objective was the wrong word to use,  sorry. Even if it's all opinion,  I would be nice to hear your reasoning backed up by examples and evidence rather than simply saying "I didn't like it" or something similar. I guess I'm just pushing too hard for a debate,  and it's turning into an argument instead. Again,  sorry. </div>
<p></p>No need to apologize dude.  Actually,  I was more confused than offended by your post,  which is why I went all nitpicky.
<p></p>There's not much more reasoning to be done though,  insofar as "I have reason to not have high hopes for the finale" is concerned.
<p></p>I will say though,  it does confuse me that Return of Harmony has fans.  I mean,  my biggest problem with it is that it just doesn't seem like a Pony episode and it derails the characters and setting for the sake of making it work in a more superhero-esque story.  You'd think such a thing would have far more backlash,  but on the contrary I've actually been told (on the Discussion for the "Dethroning Moment" page) that its a stupid thing to complain about!  Puh.

<p></p>A lot of people initially got into the show <em>because</em> the first 2 episodes made it seem like it was gonna be more of that sort of show.  A lot of people are still holding out hope that there will be more of these sorts of episodes in the future.  Personally,  I'd love more adventure style episodes like we had in Season 1.

            I definitely wouldn't call the Last Roundup an adventure episode.  There was a minute or so montage of them traveling,  then they ended up in a town and hung out with AJ.  The chase at the end was great though.  It's About Time did sort of have that feel to it,  which might be why I loved it and didn't like Lesson Zero.

            It's so weird that an episode would follow the main character it's supposed to be based on. I mean that's not what happened in The Last Roundup after all.

            I'm guessing the spoiler is fake; I guess it <em>could</em> be possible,  but I'd be skeptical until we get more info from an official source.
<p></p>@Moe: I didn't really think they got derailed all that much.  And from what I remember a lot of people were stoked at the idea of getting more adventurous.  To each his own,  I guess.

<p></p>And it was.  About 80% of the story focused on Spike. Also,  hi.

            See,  I draw a distinction between "adventure" and "Superhero" or "pseudo-Sentai."
<p></p>"Adventure" merely implies the story involves travel to a location outside of safe harbors where the heroes may have to deal with physical dangers.  It makes sense that these girls have those kinds of adventures.
<p></p>But it always feels weird when they put on the Elements of Harmony and use their magical Care Bear Stare to defeat a villain.  It always just feels <em>wrong, </em> like there's absolutely nothing about these ponies that suggests they should even be in this type of story,  and yet they are anyway.  Imagine if you saw your mom stop a Terrorist and you kinda get the idea (assuming your mom isn't a cop or other agent who'd be expected to do that).

            I wouldn't say that much; a good chunk of it was just as much about the teenage dragons as about Spike.
