            Let's just say I have problems with hp. Harry is one of the most lifeless protagonists I've ever come across,  the books almost always side with the heroes and hardly present much ambiguity,  and Voldemort is a very one-note villain.
<p></p>As for me,  mostly reading some light novels. Still sad the author of the Familiar of Zero died.

<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> How exactly do they make any kind of progress?</div>
<p></p>As said,  spells,  devices and potions <em>are</em> invented.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Why aren't there more magical 'technologiues' in common use,  since it seems like you can just enchant something and let it go? </div>
<p></p>Well,  for a start there are laws against just enchanting whatever you feel like.

            Yeah but still,  somebody could set up a company to make a specific sort of enchantment over and over,  and just sell that. I mean,  they obviously did that sort of thing with broomsticks and rememberalls,  so it just strikes me as someone would want to do that with a slightly more practical enchantment. Plus then you could get carpenters or blacksmiths in on the action,  and so on and so forth. Basically,  they have an untapped potential for industry,  really.

            Agreed. The thing kind of falls apart when you look at it closely.
<p></p>But what always confused me was that England being taken over was treated as world-ending stuff. Strange,  considering other countries have been mentioned have members pop up from time to time.

<p></p>Well,  yes. As I said,  wizards are stupic and arrogant that way. Plus we know that some things don' interact well with large ammounts of magic. As has been said before,  wizarding society tends to opperate on a "leave it once it's good enough" principle.
<p></p>It doesn't help that coppyig muggles is looked down upon. And innovation isn't encouraged the same way as it is in muggle society.

            Still,  it is kind of interesting to wonder if the Death Eaters have like,  a polish branch.
<p></p>But really,  if his is the Wizarding equivalent of a war,  it's frankly not that bad. The campaign took less than a year and there were only a few battles. Much smaller-sale than it could have been,  considering. I mean,  can you imagine if Voldemort had gotten a hold of some southern american wizarding families?
