            I just assume that Discord isn't really using magic. He's Reality Warping. Different things,  at least in the context of this show.
<p></p>He isn't using mana or any kind of harnassable force,  he's just using his own inner chaos to forcibly fuck with the building blocks of reality.

            And now,  a distraction from all this talk about friendship and how its magic. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=381814858502624&amp;set=a.134316363252476.23944.118429394841173&amp;type=1&amp;ref=nf">Princess Cadence and Shining Armor on the official MLP Facebook page<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. I think this is the first time we've seen their cutie marks.
<p></p>I still think its kinda odd they keep pushing these two. They must be putting a lot of money into this wedding playset thing.

            I'm going in the "If Celestia is aware of it she can resist it,  and she'd probably be aware of it" camp.  If she drank the potion without being aware of the magical effects it would probably affect her,  but I'm guessing she'd probably be able to sense that it's a potion,  and if she was aware of what it was when she drank it,  she could resist it's effects.
<p></p>Also,  I'm pretty sure that the "breast enhancing spell" in Negima is just inflating the swimsuit,  not actually increasing their bust size.  I mean,  when Anya uses it on herself she floats away...

            As far as I see it,  there are many ways to work magic. Most common Equestrian unicorns use structured spellscript to cast spells aside from their "affinity" spells,  the ones associated with their cutie mark.
<p></p>Celestia can cast at a primal level,  a natural form of magic bound to the world and the sun. Luna can do similar,  only her power is also bound to the moon instead.
<p></p>Discord is also working at the primal level,  but his form of Chaos magic is wild and untamed,  making it a dangerous threat to the harmonious magic worked by the ponies. It also explains his Discording,  where he infuses the pony with his Chaos and brings out their worst.

            Well,  there was the spell she used to fix the dam in ''Mare Do Well",  which was clearly a control spell running numerous subroutines that mapped the dam and pulled all the bricks back where they needed to be.
<p></p>Larger,  more complex spells like the mass illusions Rarity uses in her fashion shows and the Art of the Dress sequence are also easier to control for lower powered unicorns if they have a controlling framework to manage numerous subroutine spells that carry out all the functions. I know I'd rather use a unifying spellscript framework that lets me do the task than micro every associated subroutine,  it's not fun juggling all the variables needed for that.

            My second favorite part of the episode wa Applebloom's prediction that the town would become overun by uneducated ponies starved for apples. My favorite part was Scoots sucking all the colour out of the rainbow with a vacuum.
<p></p>Did anyone notice a shot of the treehouse with steps leading up from the house into the upper branches of the tree?

            @Neuman: good grief,  that makes terrifying sense. That princess must be Celestia's relative or something,  poor mare.

Discord was the one who told the prince how to make the potion in the first place,  so he could slide in and take control. The dragon he sent in to occupy Luna,  who was only powerful enough to duel it to a standstill at the time. With both goddesses either out of the way or in a situation he could control,  he moved in and took over the kingdom.

            That seems unnecessary considering how powerful he is. But it seems like something Discord might do simply because he'd find it funny.

            Hey,  they could have been occupied for a long damn time.
<p></p>Anyways,  I'm not being serious. I caught the whole chaos reign thing too,  but I can't really come up with a situation in which it makes sense. No,  I don;t think it meant discord at all. Just generally everything was fucking up without the boss.

Besides,  The girls didn't have a chance against discord and he still bent over backwards to screw with them. He likes to fuck around.

<p></p>Well....with Luna and Celestia together and the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EoH" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EoH">Eo H</a> they can faceroll him. The ploy gets Celestia out of the way and leaves Luna (the lesser loved of the two sisters) on her own.
