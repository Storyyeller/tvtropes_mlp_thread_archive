            Hey guys,  I had a pony dream this morning.
<p></p>Dream started out with me waking up in a house that looked kinda like one I used to live in but haven't seen in years.  I turned on the TV in one room and FIM was coming on,  so I turned it on in another room and started watching it.
<p></p>First thing the episode showed was Discord's statue,  which was now in a forest on the edge of a park or playground for some reason.  First thing I want to point out is that all the characters—Discord and everyone—looked like they do in the show,  but the setting and background looked different.  Like at times it looked like cartoon characters in a real place,  like the Roger Rabbit effect.  And suddenly Ponyville was a more wooded environment,  with every house being kind of isolated around parts of this forest (it kind of reminded me of Knothole Village),  and all the houses looked real,  too,  not like libraries carved out of trees or anything like that.  Also the episode gave the impression of taking place on an overcast day—the sky was gray but it wasn't raining or storming or anything (this is probably real life creeping in,  because today really is overcast).
<p></p>So anyway,  first thing it showed was this park and Discord's statue was at the edge,  and I was like "Oh god,  another Discord episode, " but then he talked about a plan and the statue flashed and suddenly Discord was free,  but in the form of a baby dragon (like Spike,  but he was all-gray and had wings—and yes he could fly).  And then for the first part of the episode,  he visited Twilight Sparkle (who,  again,  didn't live in a tree anymore) pretending to be a messenger from some prestigious magic school.  Here I didn't really follow the plot—he told her she had been rejected,  but offered to teach her some unique tricks anyway,  and they started to kind of get along.
<p></p>Then somehow Discord got launched away from Twilight's place and landed on a road leading to some mansion with a huge yard.  And he wound up meeting this pony who looked a lot like the "The Horror" girl from Applebuck Season.  And she said something,  and Discord had a crush on her,  but there was a servant or maybe the girl's boyfriend or something who didn't like the look of him and was suspicious or something.
<p></p>I woke up before seeing where the episode went.
<p></p>So,  any of you who are into dream interpretation,  got any theories?

<p></p><h1>"[INSERT PUNNY TITLE]"</h1>
<p></p>On a school trip to [INSERT LOCATION HERE],  the CMC meet an elderly pony who treats them very kindly,  and they soon discover that (s)he is still a blank flank. They spend some time with hir,  and have a fun time,  but must soon part ways as Cheerilee leads the class away. However,  after leaving hir,  they find out that the elderly pony has a terminal illness,  and is going to die soon. With this knowledge,  they sneak away from the group,  and meet up with the elderly pony,  inducting hir into the CMC. And,  so,  they set out to get hir a cutie mark. They try many things,  and,  one by one,  they find their own cutie marks while doing activities to help the elderly pony get one. The next day,  they go to meet up with the elderly pony,  again,  only to find hir in the hospital dying. The elderly pony isn't aloud out of the hospital,  and,  instead,  spend the day talking to hir,  and,  at the end of the day,  (s)he finally gains hir cutie mark,  a picture of the CMC. They fall asleep at hir bed side,  but,  when they wake up,  they find out (s)he died in hir sleep. The episode ends with them attending hir funeral,  all with their cutie marks.

            I should take pictures of my plushie prototype as I put it together. It's gonna be a little more patchwork than I like since I'm probably going to have to attach the legs to a torso piece then attach the head and stuff it,  also I will need to make the mane and tail and eyes and cutie mark and attach them accordingly.
<p></p>I'm hoping for an episode dealing with death in Season Three. After all Sesame Street has already done it well.

            Sweetie Belle crashed a funeral in Hearts and Hooves Day,  and that didn't really negate the slapstick. People DO die eventually. Just a fact of life. If they dealt with a natural death,  that wouldn't be too outrageous.
<p></p>Someone getting killed by some act of violence on or off-screen - that they will definitely not do.
