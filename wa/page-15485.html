<p></p>Techincally,  Derpy is her only official name. But that's a whole other can of worms.

<p></p>Yeah it's kind of funny how they go out of their way to avoid ever naming her now.

I'll admit to being bias though,  as I'm not much of a fan of the new series of DW,  and that's where that incarnation seems to be inspired from.</div>
<p></p>I prefer to think of him as a Doctor Who themed pony instead of the same exact character in pony form.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I'd actually say watch a classic episode. They're more stand-alone than the new series which is more like an arc-based drama pretending to be a serial-based show.</div>
<p></p>I watched The Daleks once but it really drags on in the later half. They should have just cut if off after 3 episodes or so.

            @ J Teeth,  like he said,  just watch New Who and should be good for a start. it's only 7 seasons so far,  but they are British seasons,  so half the length of an American one.

            The funny thing is the whole Doctor Whooves thing is a thing because people think Time Turner looks like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant">David Tennant</a>. I fail to see it,  even now with a tie added on. He had a whole conversation with Apple Bloom and he didn't have a British accent. He's not even the first pony to show up with an hourglass cutie mark! That honor goes to Colgate/Minnuette,  who's blue &amp; white like the TARDIS!
<p></p>I find it even stranger that Derpy is the fan-favorite companion for him,  despite the association with the 10th Doctor and there being a pony named Rose. There's a DW companion named Rose!

<p></p>Don't get me wrong,  I like a lot of the Doctor Whooves fanworks,  I just have trouble grasping how it all got started. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>,  I guess.

            I think early on there was more fan works with the Doctor and Rose,  but Derpy sort of took over because she's a much more prominent background pony and because her personality makes a good contrast with the Doctor.

            People just want to see references to their favorite stuff,  even when they aren't there. Even when they are aware that it's not an intentional reference. I'm also against even calling him "Doctor Whooves"/"Doctor Hooves" or something like that and don't think they should canonize that. How they even got away with putting the name on official stuff is beyond me (but I'm not too happy about it). Making him a ponified Doctor is just tacky as hell and incredibly out of place. That stuff is best reserved for fanworks (of the kind that I avoid). While I'm awar that they'll never make him an actualy pony Doctor in canon,  the name itself is bad enough.

            He also appeared as the one who turned the hourglass in Cider Squeezy. Anyway,  does Rose even have a fanon personality? I guess Derpy has a much better developed character (though really people use lots of different personalities depending on personal preference and headcanon)

            My headcanon is pretty much in line with what they've officially said about Time Turner. His card says he maintains Ponyville's clock towers; I've expanded that,  in a round-robin fic I'm involved with,  into saying that he's also the village watchmaker. There's <em>something</em> unusual about him,  but no one can quite lay a hoof on what precisely it is.
