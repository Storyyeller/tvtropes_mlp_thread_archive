            My Boyfriend used to be a cat person,  but he's totally a dog person now.  When I mentioned possibly getting a cat after our dog walks the rainbow bridge,  he said no cuz a cat would just get up on top of stuff and knock everything down (My dog is 8 years old and has some health problems that are from genetics so I dont expect him to last forever <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad"> Im not wishing him to die or anything).
<p></p>He hated our dog when I first got him,  now they are inseparable.

            I admit we didn't train our dog very well. One rainy night,  he got out the front gate and ran off somewhere. Then he somehow got back in again even though everything was shut. That dog either has reality warping powers or he's a ninja.

            Dogs are all too happy to be dependant on their humans,  so they don't exercise their smarts much.

            I grew up with both Cats and Dogs,  so I'm very much both. At the moment though a cat is the only option for me; even if my apartment didn't ban larger pets(Not a fan of SMALL dogs,  really),  I live in the middle of downtown and don't have much time to care for it. So a more independent pet is a must.

            If he does last the poor guy is going to be blind. He doesnt make any tears in his eyes so I have to constantly clean them and put drops in them.  He also has to be fed 80 dollar a bag dog food or his skin peels off.  He also has liver problems of some sort,  and just recently we had to have a lump biopsied.
<p></p>About 2 years ago he had 1500 dollar surgery to fix a torn ACL..

I used to joke that she was a Black Shuck and could teleport.

            As long as we're telling stories about pets I have a good one. Our next door neighbors once had a cat,  a black persian to be specific. Apparently she got pregnant at some point. Th neighbors sold one or two of her kittens,  then left the mother and the other three kittens out in the cold without any shelter at all. In the dead of winter. A Canadian winter. Pretty sure the mom used to live in the house prior to this point because she clearly knew how to use a litterbox and actually seems to prefer it to the alternative. Anyway my mom and me,  we knew we couldn't let these newborn kittens freeze to death so we made a shelter for them in our back yard and coaxed the mom to come over. I'm not entirely sure how she got all three of her kittens over the fence but she did. Today all her kittens have left and the mom is pushing 15,  living with us in the house about half the time and catting around outside for the rest. She likes to sleep in my bed with me,  as does our dog.
