            See,  I thought the pediatrician was under the impression that Twilight had brought in a pony that had been transmuted into a dragon.
<p></p>I wonder what Banana Split's mark means. Is he yet another dessertier pony? Ponyville seems to produce a lot of 'em.

He's a PONY doctor! Ponies would've only ever brought other PONIES to him. Why would you ever bring something that wasn't a PONY to a PONY doctor? Transformation magic isn't all that rare in equestria. Simplest explanation: This is a transformed PONY. Which he WOULD be able to help with. He came to a logical conclusion I think

            Um... was it obvious that he was a dragon? I mean,  yeah,  WE know he's a dragon,  but at that point he looked pretty different to any dragon that we'd seen previously. Maybe the doctor himself had just managed to piece it together after the fire,  and honestly didn't believe that Twilght would know. From his POV this is a pony who'd been turned into some mysterious creature overnight

            I can kinda get what you're saying,  but even if Twilight <em>was</em> bringing in a pony that had been turned into a dragon,  it doesn't really answer the <em>real</em> question at hand,  that being "<em>why</em> is he a dragon''".  But really,  that whole scene ran on <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> anyway.  I can kinda get the doctor's utter befuddlement; he simply has no expertise in dealing with non-ponies.  Honestly his recommendation of going to vet makes more sense than anything else he said; a vet would be more familiar with reptiles.

At that point Spike didn't LOOK much like a regular dragon. Generally,  you identify the symptoms first,  then work from there. In the doctor's mind,  that's what he was doing (a symptom being that this pony is now a dragon). Plus,  what if Twilight DIDN'T know what a dragon was,  wouldn't you say she has a right to know? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            Really,  the thing that mystified me most about the doctor and the vet is that neither one seems to be in the least bit familiar with Spike or Twilight.  You'd think they'd have at least <em>heard</em> that Celestia's student and her dragon assistant were staying in the town.  Maybe Ponyville is too small to have a doctor's office,  so Twilight took Spike to the next town over.
<p></p>@Ginger: What I mean is that even if Twilight didn't realize that Spike was now a dragon,  the fact that the doctor informs her that he's a dragon isn't that helpful unless he also explains <em>why</em> he's a dragon.  It's like having a weird growth on your foot,  and having the doctor go "Yup,  it's a fungus".  That might be entirely accurate,  but what you really want to know is why it's there and how to get rid of it.
<p></p>But that's being overly picky.  I think the main thing with the doctor is the phrasing.  If he would have said "he seems to have been turned into a dragon",  it wouldn't come across as stating the obvious so much.

            Well,  spike was looking pretty different by that point.
<p></p>What bothered me about the doctor was how goddamn <em>patronizing</em> he was being,  even for a pediatrician. He works with foals all day long,  you think he'd have learned to give them a bit of respect by that point. Baby-talk just pisses me right off,  for some reason.
<p></p>I personally kinda liked licket-split. He was only around for a little bit,  but he was cool. It's nice to see more colts.

            Yeah,  but she works with animals. with her I can at least <em>see</em> it; if Twilight did bring Spike to her she would have assumed he was a pet,  and by that time he wasn't exactly talky anymore either. With her it makes sense.

            No,  I got that. It was just weird that Spike got angry at the Doctor for being patronizing,  yet was fine when the vet did the same thing (and I mean he was fine with it even BEFORE she busted out the dog treats)

            Well,  Spike was basically <em>acting</em> animalistic while he was at the vet (apparently his dragon hormones or whatever had pretty much overtaken his personality at that point),  and if the vet had never seen a dragon before,  she had no reason to assume that he wasn't.
