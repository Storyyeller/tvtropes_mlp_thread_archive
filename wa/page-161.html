            I found Fluttershy's breakdown to be much more disturbing than that of Pinkie's,  for some odd reason. I mean,  it's supposed to be comical,  but how aloof do those animals have to be to cause <em>Fluttershy</em>' of all ponies to enter that amount of rage?
<p></p>In a way,  it's kind of on the same tier as Pinkie's breakdown - the things you've always loved and who've always loved you back have suddenly and for no discernible reason just decided to avoid you. Although Pinkie Pie had more of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">Break the Cutie</a> feel,  you could see the increasing frustration more here than with Pinkie.
<p></p>I think it's just that Fluttershy is so incredibly <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">Moe</a> that it's more tragic when she loses her mind.

            Think about it: whenever a pony has a breakdown,  it's because their natural talent or something they have an affinity for is failing them for some reason,  and they snap at being unable to overcome difficulties they have never faced before.

            Love the finale,  I was hoping for some thing more epic but I was savy  enough to not hope to much so  episode wasn't disopointing.
<p></p>And about new Pony Time Lord,  (maybe I don't saw any similarity with other Doctor incarnations)for me he looks like pony version of last Master incarnation (or close enough).

            You know what's sad? I <em>just</em> realized that Canterlot was a pun on Camelot,  mostly because I don't know what the heck a "canter" is. Speaking of horse puns,  how long before we hear someone make reference to a Barnway musical?
<p></p>This is a really popular show right? It is both relevent today and is based on 80's nostalgia. So how much longer before we get a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotChicken" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a> sketch based off of it?

It was about Apocalypse Ponies.
<p></p>On a different note,  I find it funny that Tara Strong is the only VA out of the main cast to not voice another character.

<p></p>Yes it's funny for me to. She is propably Voice Actress with biggest number of roles and yet here she play only one character (horever main character) and not even sing for her.

            I thought it was interesting to see what Celestia really thought of the Gala. I take it as evidence that when given the option,  she'd rather humor the ponies expecting formality than assert her power as a monarch.
<p></p>It seems to match up with what we've seen of her in A Bird in the Hoof. Everyone else besides Pinkie seemed to be taking things more seriously than she probably would have liked,  but we didn't see her insisting that they be less formal than they'd be comfortable with,  just playing a little joke on the Cakes when they were getting too stressed out.

            This episode,  combined with "Bird in the Hoof, " makes it quite clear that Celestia does not like being royalty. At least,  she doesn't like the part where she has to act all formal and dainty. I'd like to see an episode where she ditched work and allowed herself to cut loose.
...Now I have a mental image of Celestia at a karaoke bar singing <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAgYC89I73Y">''Want it All Back'' by the Seatbelts.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

            Well,  think about it.  She's spent the last 1, 000 years doing everything on her own.  Raising the sun and moon,  teaching Advanced Magic Classes,  attending all of Equestria's big functions and events,  basically running the entire world.  God knows I'd get bored around year 50.

<p></p>No doubt that part of the reason she was thrilled about Twilight &amp; Co. showing up and spicing things up.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">teaching Advanced Magic Classes, </div>
<p></p>I do have to wonder about how much teaching she actually does herself. She has Twilight as her own personal student,  but since there didn't seem to be any indication that she does much to decide who gets into her school and who doesn't,  I wouldn't be surprised if she's extremely limited in how much actual teaching she does.
