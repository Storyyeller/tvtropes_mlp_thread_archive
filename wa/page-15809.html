            I dont post often in here (my bad) but I saw this news and looked up Posey's posts,  she seemed to do her upmost to be positive. I'm sad that wasn't enough to see her though,  and appreciate you as a friend coming to let people know,  despite the pain I'm sure your feeling right now.
<p></p>I think it's a hard world to be positive in sometimes,  I was in an awful depressed funk yesterday and it scared me a little...I occasionally have mini-depressed moments about not fitting in or feeling stuck in my current situation (not that it's bad,  it's just...desire for change really?). But I had almost 24 hours where I just felt hopeless and weepy :/ ponies actually helped lift me out of that mood,  irregardless of Hub making silly edits.

            This might be an odd thing to bring up,   especially coming from a newbie,   but am I the only one who prefers G1's designs when compared to G4's? They just look so much more like horses to me. I still like FIM,   don't get me wrong,   and it greatly improves on the original in almost every single way. It's probably just the nostalgic little girl in me. <br>
It's fairly common in Japanese writing. Kanji (the more complicated characters that you see in the image) is technically its own alphabet as well. The more boxy looking characters are katakana,   which is used for loan words (like the pony names). The simple characters are hiragana,   the most basic of Japanese writing. :) <br>Looks like my four years of Japanese in high school have finally become useful...on an internet forum. <br> <br>
Thanks for the welcome,   guys! :) <br>
I don't know what the future holds for MLP. Personally,   I hope that it will be a continuation of the series appealing to children of all genders and ages. I want to be able to watch it with my children and STILL enjoy it. <br> <br> <br>It'd be interesting to see a brony take on G5,   but I'm worried it'd be too similar to G4 in terms of the feel of the show. Not that it's a bad thing,   but G5 should expand upon G4 — not copy it. <br> <br> <br>I am apparently channelling my inner internet reviewer,   and on one of my favorite games (System Shock 2) no less. Curious. <br>
I wonder who THAT could be. ;) <br> <br> <br>My life as an astrophysics student right there. <br> <br> <br>I'll keep that in mind. :) <br>
I would pay so much money for that. <br>
Go for it! <br> <br> <br>So much me that it hurts. :( <br> <br> <br>
Nice to meet you too. :) <br>But alas,   I must depart to laugh myself asleep atop my piles of money that I have accumulated over my years of being a college student. <br>Farewell all! <br> <br> <br>D'aww! :D <br> <br> <br>I absolutely LOVE the Japanese opening! It's super cute,   but a little...ill fitting,   if that makes any sense. <br> <br>
Ever hear of the Medusa Cascade,   doctor?  <br>You could say that. <br> <br>
People have been treating me like a sockpuppet? I thought everyone was being pretty friendly. <br>Eh,   whatever. No harm done.  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Watch out. They'll do that to ya.  <br> <br>Not only am I having tea right now,   I'm also eating scones. <br>/dons monocle/ <br> <br>
I am indeed a really big G1 fan. Ask me your questions,   'o mighty ones!  <br> <br>
I vaguely remember something similar in the comics... Maybe...
There were humans in G1,   like the witches,   that lived in Dream Valley. <br> <br>
NINJA'ED! <br> <br> <br>I think that could be one of Applejack's secret strengths. Everyone assumes that since she's the Element of Honesty,   that she can't lie,   so she could bend that to her advantage. <br> <br> <br>I personally think that it is. :) <br> <br> <br>BURN <br> <br> <br>Maybe she just became a pegasus? <br> <br> <br>YES <br> <br> <br>I tend to think as little as possible.  <br> <br> <br>WHY Japan? WHY YOU SO MOE? <br> <br> <br>I can pick out a few words... <br>It's a 'lil bit creepy. <br>EDIT:  Mis-translated some of the kanji. It's alright. My bad. <br> <br>
Yes,   seeya! <br>I should probably do my Uni work too... <br> <br>
I think all the angst is a little justified,   but kind of silly. <br> <br>
I don't even. <br> <br>
WHAT <br>I SLEPT TOO LONG! <br>(Waits for someone to get reference) <br> <br> <br>I suddenly want spagetti. <br> <br> <br>Huh. I'd like to see some kind of AU or backstory where the ponies organized this way. <br> <br> <br>That's awesome world building! If you don't write a fic with that,   I will. <br> <br>
@ Death Cloud <br>Me gusta  <br> <br>
Stop making me hungry.  <br> <br>
I certainly did. Drama goes down smooth with a swig of Jack Daniels,   I find. <br> <br> <br>YESSS <br> <br>
@ d Roy <br>Sweetie Belle is my favorite CMC. That'd be awesome!  <br> <br>@ d Roy <br>I tend to think everything is pretty neat and this is PRETTY DAMN NEAT. <br>
I am suddenly in love with whoever edited that video. <br> <br> <br>Never been more scared of ponies in my life. <br> <br> <br>Wat. <br> <br> <br>Thank goodness it's SFW. My mind went weird places before I realized that. <br> <br> <br>/giggles madly/ <br>Ha ha ha... <br>It's way past my bedtime... <br> <br>
@ Death Cloud <br>As am I.  <br> <br> <br>That made me laugh so hard my roommate thought I was having an episode! <br> <br> <br>That's what I always thought too...but I guess it's fundamentally different somehow? <br> <br>
@ NES <br>As a writer of Dark!Fic,   this pleases me. <br> <br>
And ponies like to be brushed. Win-Win. <br> <br> <br>That fourth one reminds me of my mother on my older brother's wedding day,   except with wanting me to find a "nice Jewish boy". I'm pretty sure we're the only Jewish family in our county so... <br> <br> <br>@ Turtlebutter <br>Dissecting Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie has been a dream of my MLP-hating younger brother. I'll give him a ring if you find anything...interesting.  <br> <br>I still have "Mr. Big Bear",   a 12" teddy bear that I got when I was about 13 months. He still wears my shirt from kindergarten. <br> <br>
Conglaturation !!!
You have posted on a great forum.
And prooved the justice of our culture.
Now go and rest our hero ! <br> <br>
Or you can just follow NES's weird comb obsession. <br> <br>
Now that we have a tumblr,   we can expand the TV Tropes empire to enslave all of Equestria! <br>...I mean,   "the Internet". <br> <br>
Considering the amount of alcohol I've consumed today,   I'm surprised I'm not dead. <br>'Night,   all. Here's hoping my hangover tomorrow will prevent me from diddling my life away on these here forums...
'Naw. Doubt it. <br> <br>
BERRY PUNCH IS MY PATRON SAINT! <br>... <br>/goes back into a drunken stupor/ <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>It's the BEST tumblr. With hookers and blackjack. <br> <br>
I think I would get along well with Berry Punch or Rarity. <br> <br> <br>This terrifies me. <br> <br> <br>Maybe... <br>Now I want to see Paleo-ponies / cavemen ponies.  <br> <br>The cannibalism discussion was what I would use as an excuse to lurk here. <br> <br>
"crazy within reason" <br>Yes.  <br> <br>From volunteering at the zoo for six years,   I can assure you that penguins are indeed evil. <br>Little fish grubbing tuxedo wearing nasties <br> <br> <br>I haven't heard of any clips yet. Anyone else know? <br> <br> <br>Through the goodness of my heart,   I have not made a Dragon Ball Z joke. Praise me. <br> <br>
Since I'm currently drunker than a skunker,   I cannot contribute at all to this thread. <br> <br> <br>
I accuse thee of scrying upon the future,   man-witch! <br> <br> <br>I fail to see any negative consequences of this situation.  <br> <br>
Sounds excellent. Can't be worse for me than Jack Daniels. <br>
Damn you to hell! I just got that song out of my head! <br> <br>
@ Roy <br>No me gusta. <br>この歌が大嫌い。 <br> <br> <br>Wasn't it in Magic Duel? Or was that just one of Twilight's tricks? <br> <br> <br>It's happened to me too. <br> <br> <br>Maybe she just woke up like that... <br>It's happened to me before. <br> <br>
Maybe the sea ponies have some indentifying mark like a cutie mark? <br> <br> <br>Please let that be canon.  <br> <br>
D'aww. <br> <br> <br>You should draw a mule family...or something. I dunno. <br> <br>
@ Sereg <br>I like the Lunaverse too. SO much potential. <br> <br>
@ d Roy <br>Morning to you too! <br>I'm doing fine,   but I have to go to work in a couple of hours. That ALWAYS ruins my mood. <br> <br>
I absolutely love Harmony Theory.  <br> <br>
I would like to second this recommendation.  <br> <br>I have a major exam in Chinese later so... <br>/continues to lurk/ <br> <br>
I hope it's somepony like Zecora! <br> <br> <br>That's kinda what I assumed all you guys sorta looked like on this thread. /blushes/ <br> <br>
Well,   considering I probably bombed that Chinese exam after studying the language for five years,   I think I'll just go to bed. <br>Night all! <br> <br>
@ Ace <br>Sweet! The new episode is out?! <br> <br> <br>/comes back to the thread/ <br>Wha...?  <br> <br>
Those spiders were the BANE of my existence! Screw you,   Looking Glass! Screw you! <br> <br> <br>/backs away as so to not scare you/ <br> <br> <br>So pretty... <br> <br>
I'm actually a vegan. <br>
Yes. They are nasty. <br> <br>
@ Applelight <br>It's all about texture for me. Bad vegan food (especially ones that emulate non vegan ingredients or dishes) are often mushy,   even if they taste good. <br>One thing that's a big problem in vegan cooking is the substitution for eggs and milk,   so good vegan pastries are hard to come by. <br> <br>
@ storyyeller <br> <br> <br>I listen to The Pussycat Dolls when I write. The vapidity of the lyrics and repetitiveness of the beat serve me well.  <br> <br>Eh,   I play for overarching plot,   so I only really thought the first game was all that good. <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ME2" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ME2">ME 2</a> was too railroady with the Illusive Man and <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ME3" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ME3">ME 3</a>...no. <br>They were more fun gameplay wise than the first game. <br> <br>
Good night all! <br>I'm off to contract alcohol poisoning with my roomies! <br> <br> <br>Everything's fine. How'ya doing? Turns out I didn't fail that Chinese exam after all,   so that made MY day. <br> <br> <br> <br>I'm actually fairly good at writing Chinese,   just not all that good at reading it. <br> <br> <br>I would have never compared those two scenes... Huh... <br> <br> <br>Cool beans! <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
I'd eat a delicious Scootaloo veggie burger.  <br>My dad worked at one of the chicken slaughterhouses that they buy from for twenty years. His stories are the reason I went vegan. <br> <br>
A gloriously weird place. <br> <br>
I am scared of that picture of Luna. <br> <br>
Hangout stream? <br> <br> <br>I simply ADORE Friendship is Witchcraft!  <br> <br>
An infinity sign? <br> <br>
Everypony knows durian is best fruit. <br> <br>
Been off the thread a couple of days. How is everybody doing? <br> <br> <br>I'm the only one allowed to be *hic* "sober" on this thread.  <br> <br>Sleep deprivation =/= Drunk <br>I should know,   having extensive experiences with both conditions. <br> <br> <br>I have never had more want in my life. I NEED this to be a thing. <br> <br> <br>Don't be so hard on yourself,   Applelight! I think that it's wonderful! <br> <br> <br>I hate you for that spoiler. HATE <br> <br>
@ storyyeller <br>As a child,   I suffered through those CDI games. SUFFERED. <br> <br>
@ storyyeller <br>My brother has a 3do. Our father owns a video game store,   so we got some of the inventory that didn't sell. <br> <br>
@ Will <br>I own the Zelda CDI games,   Hotel Mario,   Alice in Wonderland,   and Cluedo. <br> <br> <br>Thanks for describing <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyraBon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyraBon">Lyra Bon</a>.

On the subject of exercise,   I'm on my university's kickboxing team,   which gets me all the exercise I need. <br> <br>
I wouldn't mind having an earth pony help shape up the community garden I work at. <br> <br> <br>That would indeed be awesome! <br> <br> <br>All of the YES <br> <br> <br>So much sense yet so much squick <br> <br>
Didn't know that PMMM was mainstream enough to have mainstream characters. <br> <br> <br>/refuses to make <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PotC" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PotC">Pot C</a> reference/ <br>... <br>/pats self on back/ <br> <br>
I used to play violin in middle school before I switched to viola because it's more badass. <br> <br>
@storyyeller <br>That's the only shitty part about it for me. But I still take comfort in the fact that my instrument is a better bludgeon in case of zombie apocalypse than a violin. <br> <br>
Violas are pretty badass. I just so happened to get in a fight with a very angry first chair and the damn thing broke my arm! <br> <br>
I suddenly want someone to duel wield basses irl,   either the fish or the instrument. <br> <br>
@ applelight <br>I might just steal that name for my new fic,   it's so good. <br> <br> <br>All the bitches are just jealous of the motherbucking viola. <br> <br>
Everybody knows you need fifty Dire Rat Gallbladders for the Level 3 Rouge quest. <br> <br>
The devs must really think us stupid to deal with these shitty drop rates. <br>... <br>/scurries away to do homework/ <br> <br>
Night all. Sleep tight,   applelight <br> <br> <br>God I needed that this morning. Thanks,   Irish. <br> <br>
@ applelight <br>That might be just a wee bit OP. <br> <br>
@storyyeller <br>A MLP portal what-now? <br>/is excited/ <br> <br> <br>Tell me all about it! Is it good? Bad?  <br>You wrote a game?! That's amazing!  <br> <br>@ applelight <br>It's looking much better! You've really improved. I wouldn't say that the colors are flat,   but I think that you should try experimenting with more shading and highlights. <br> <br>
It's really awesome. Are you studying game design,   storyyeler? <br> <br>
I wouldn't really know. The same reason why some people are attracted to other cartoon animals?
It's not exactly a new concept. <br> <br>
/abandons ship/ <br> <br>
I personally don't let r34 ruin this fandom for me,   but it digusts me enough that I get where you're coming from Sorastitch. <br> <br>
You can comb me all you want,   NES. Just try to get through this thick and curly Jewish hair! Bwahahahaha!  <br> <br>
I love that vid! <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JanAnimations" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JanAnimations">Jan Animations</a> is the best. I can't wait to see it finished. <br>Donating blood today. I'm a little scared. <br> <br>
thanks for the vote of confidence,   story. &gt;&gt; <br> <br>
It's the needles and the volume. I've never had that much blood come out of me before. <br> <br>
My blood is just barely suitiable. The only reason they want it is because I have a rare blood type: AB- <br> <br>
Thanks,   JT.  <br> <br>Donating right now! Give me strength,   my bronies! <br> <br> <br>Sir?! <br>But I appreciate it regardless.  <br> <br>Donating blood wasn't bad at all. Thouugh I amm geeling a bit woo0zy <br> <br> <br>that episode traumatized me as a child. <br> <br> <br>Maybe his wings are just small for his age? <br> <br>
Cats usually just don't give a shit,   in my experience. <br> <br>
@ Ace <br>So well,   that might just be my custom thumbnail for this thread. <br> <br>
Eeyup. We're all just a bunch of pony lovers who happen to talk about other things than ponies at times. <br> <br>
I vote we sacrifice a virgin to the TV Trope gods when we hit that mark. <br> <br>
@ Ace <br>You have just made a powerful enemy. I control the horizontal and the vertical! Do not adjust your set! <br> <br>
@ Ace <br>Teehee.  <br> <br>@ story <br>That's insane! Maybe I'm used to really slow forums or something. <br> <br>
500 pages til we can sacrifice Purple Dalek! <br> <br>
Even me. Being completely absent has caused this. <br> <br>
Huh. I think I'll wait for more developments. <br>Night all! <br> <br>
@ crimson <br>Congrats...? <br> <br>
@ Kyler <br>ALL OF THE PRESSURE <br> <br>
@story <br>Sacrifice? <br> <br>
@ crimson <br>they made me rage more than i should. <br> <br>
@ Irish <br>You earned it. ...I guess? <br> <br>
@ Seraphem <br>Cool! Could always use some fresh faces around here! <br> <br>
I don't take it personally. I've been accused of being a sockpuppet by a pony with a bowtie and a british accent. Nothing phases me anymore. <br> <br>
Love ya too,   NES. &lt;3 <br> <br>
Well,   sleepy time for Posey.
Night everyone. Especially Pinkie. Go. To. Bed. Little. Filly. <br> <br>
@Drenius <br>Me gusta. <br> <br> <br>Oh shit. Twilight dissing up in here. <br> <br>
@ story <br>I second the Luminosity recommendation. <br> <br> <br>My grandmother used to tell me tales of Nucklevees when I was a girl. They scared the jeezus out of me. <br> <br> <br>Is that even possible? <br> <br>
/cones back from watching the blogosphere explode with the announcement of the Sims 4/ <br>GO APPLE,   GO! <br> <br>
@Steventheman <br>And we've already got a thread <br> <br>
Sockpuppet? I speak sockpuppet! <br> <br>
I never watched Arthur either. The character designs were really ugly looking to me. <br>/goes back to writing granny in equestria fic/ <br> <br>
I'll just call you Darkie-poo,   if that's okay. <br> <br>
@Crowfall <br>Ooh! Much better! How about Geraldo? Then I can imagine him selling mustache wax. <br> <br>
STORY <br>STORY <br>YA DONE BUMPED ME. <br>STORY Y <br> <br>
@story <br>I've had to doodle about with applications for...undesireable places. <br> <br>
@story <br>nope. just drunk <br> <br>
Ace's moustache is the only one I'll ever love. <br>Good night,   everypony. <br> <br>
Ace! You've returned! <br> <br>
I personally post by iPod. <br> <br>
@ Ace <br>0o <br>That's real dedication. <br> <br>
@ Red <br>I love that artist! <br> <br>
@ applelight <br>Me too! Such wonderful character design!  <br> <br>It's never NOT a good time to recommend Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. <br> <br>
@ applelight <br>I'm slowly working on a headcanon that involves this very thing... <br> <br>
Head— <br>OH GOD WHY <br> <br>
@ Kuroi <br>MAKE FIC OF THAT PLZ <br> <br> <br>Ha! Almost got me there! <br> <br> <br>D'aww <br> <br>
@ story <br>Scoots was planned to be disabled? Huh. That...makes sense. <br> <br>
Ah,   that explains the lack of images on the trope pages. <br> <br>
I want a Sweetie Belle plushie to cuddle and coddle and call my own. :) <br> <br>
Eeyup <br> <br>
Is the formatting working again for everypony? <br> <br>
@ Gwen <br>D'aww. So many wonderful feels. <br> <br>
@ Lopiny <br>Feels <br> <br>

my head hurts... <br>/looks at posts/ <br>my brain hurts <br> <br>
@ Applelight <br>Eeyup. <br>I was apparently drunk enough to invoke the "Jew law". <br>And to say that I loved you...twice. <br>Damn <br> <br>
@ Applelight <br>Eeyup. You best be thanking your lucky stars that my mother didn't sense those posts and try to marry us to each other. <br> <br>
You'd think that's a joke,   wouldn't you. <br> <br>
Oh,   sweet NES. Sweet,   innocent NES <br> <br>
Essentially,   yes. Applelight was there and things got...weird <br> <br>
@ Ace <br>Cannot hold in the D'aww <br> <br>
You should do what ever feels right to you,   sugarcube. <br> <br>
@ ed <br>That's whatcha get for implyin' me and Appleligh' were in some sort of tree. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
:) <br>Making my day,   Ace. Making my day. <br> <br>
@ story <br>Looks like it. <br>Starts with a z,   right? <br> <br>
Weaville! That's it! The evolution of Sneasel,   my favorite mon! <br> <br>
@ Blissey <br>I ship it. <br> <br>
@ Irish <br>What about that "manly" Brain Bleach that has five calories? <br>@ Applelight <br>I'd say to just keep calm and don't strike at her physically. You'll both regret it if it gets that far. <br> <br>
@ Blissey <br>YES. ALL OF THE YES <br> <br>
@ apple <br>Knew you could do it! <br> <br>
Yeah,   I mean,   funk isn't a good thing in copious amounts. Ick. <br> <br>
I didn't say that! Libel! <br> <br>
@ Apple <br>What kind of exercise? <br> <br>
You're fine then,   sweetie. <br> <br>
Just had a one-woman dance party while looking through the freezer in front of my roommate. "Pinkie's Brew" on repeat. Not sure if proud.  <br> <br>I love that Twilight still tries to eat like a pony.  <br> <br>@ Calnos <br>Ikr? GIMMIE HUMANIZED BERRY PUNCH <br> <br>
@ Ace <br>Shipping it 'cuz that first pic <br> <br> <br>Never be surprised by the fanservice fodder <br> <br>
We should post fluffy stuff to counteract that. <br> <br>
@ Apple <br>You'll get used to it. It's a great feeling though,   isn't it? Knowing that you're all sore 'cuz you exercised. <br> <br>
@ Ace <br>MY EYES SO BEAUTIFUL <br> <br>
No,   Steven's the changling! Get him! <br> <br>
My fic idea's been two years in the works. That makes me feel old... <br> <br>
@ Sora <br>I WILL DESTROY YOU <br> <br> <br>@ apple <br>Totally leaving you for NES  <br> <br>It's the combing. Bitches love combing. <br>
Like you're one to talk ed.  <br> <br>
you even quote fallout 3. <br>Bby,   i love you. <br> <br>
@ Apple <br>Good luck with that.  <br> <br>
Probably VERY different. But don't worry. We're but two faceless beings afloat upon the internet's sea. I'm sure we can make it work. <br> <br>
@ Apple <br>That's my lighty-wighty. /gives kiss on cheek/ <br> <br> <br>Maybe. I dunno. <br> <br>
@ dark <br>Or love him. Whichever <br> <br> <br>/checks off "Start blood feud" on bucket list/ <br>Some joking aside,   Applelight took it rather well. <br> <br>
( Joke... I hope.) <br> <br>
@ Orion <br>EVERYTHING <br> <br>
@ dark <br>Or alcohol level. Never forget the booze. <br> <br>
I now want a lady version of the jelly pony except with cheese. Yes. <br>
Don't give up,   Applelight! You can beat the block! <br> <br>
@ d Roy <br>Dammit d Roy. Why must you make me hungry for awful food? <br> <br>
@crimson <br>You speak as though sicking giant ants on Ponyville is a bad thing. <br> <br>
@ ed <br>There is a special circle in hell for punners,   ed. <br> <br>
@ JT <br>Try to have fun,   dear. You're probably only going to do this once in your life <br> <br> <br>Thank you. <br> <br> <br>@ crimson <br>:) <br>Thanks. Made my day. <br> <br> <br>I'd ship that last one.  <br> <br>Isn't it true that back in the day,   it was thought that learning to swim and then serving on a ship was unlucky or drew unwanted attention from the sea? <br> <br>
I don't know what's going on but I like it.  <br> <br>
Bby,   it don't matter where my milk comes from. All that matters is that sweet,   sweet calcium. <br> <br>
Maaaaaayyyybbbbeeee <br> <br> <br> <br>Perhaps. <br> <br> <br>Ewww... <br> <br> <br>LOVE that trend. The Princess Bride is primo stuff. <br> <br>
/Apple raging/ <br>/JT still has same avatar/ <br>Glad I haven't missed anything.
But seriously,   I suggest to you — Applelight — that you find a safe and personal way of taking out your anger and other pent-up emotions. I personally find that talking to a counselor helps. <br> <br>
Despite all your rage,   you still just a Nic in a Cage. <br> <br> <br>I knew I missed something.  <br> <br>
I love Ruby/Berry Pinch.  <br>I would assume you would do that in the Video Games subforum. <br> <br>
It's sad to watch a thread die.  <br> <br>
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA <br> <br>
Hey Applelight. What's the haps? <br> <br>
With clothes on PLEASE. <br> <br> <br>
Sounds like my day.  <br> <br>
Awesome cosplay! <br> <br> <br>
Ooh! Bemusement! <br> <br>
Reminds me of that F-5 that hit Greensboro,   Kansas. My poor old gram nearly didn't make it out of that one. <br> <br> <br>Night,   Applelight. <br>Nice to see this thread moving at a good pace again.  <br> <br>Pinkie! <br>...That should be enough. <br> <br> <br>Bill Nye? <br>Also,   congrats to Applelight!  <br> <br>'Sup errebuddy. Just got back from my two week trip around Asia. How's it been hanging? <br> <br>
East Asia; China and Japan for the most part with a layover in Korea. <br>It was awesome. I saw a motherbucking panda for real! That's been my dream since I was like six,   so my life is fulfilled...for now.
I just have to catch up on all the MLP stuff that I missed out on. Anything important? <br> <br>
@ Red <br>I studied Japanese for 5 years and I've studied Chinese for only two,   but I know enough of the language to get by. I still stand out as a stumbling gaijin,   but not one that would get tongue-tied talking to your average Japanese — and to a lesser extent,   Chinese — person. <br>I was in Osaka,   btw. Visiting family. <br> <br>
@ Keg <br>Stop making me write Crossover fanfiction,   Keg! <br> <br>
//quickly edits out link// <br> <br> <br>Want to trade roomies? Mine are a bunch of bitchy drug addicts who WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE WITH MY COMPUTER. I'M TALKING TO YOU WHO'S LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER,   ALLISON! <br> <br> <br>Is he cute? I can deal with him if he's cute.
Hahaha. <br>Also on topic,   I gots me a new avatar. MLP:FIM style,   this time! <br> <br>
THE MORE YOU KNOW <br> <br>
I used to room with some friends of mine from high school,   but they all got pregnant and married. I get to be the lonely spinster of the group now! Hurrah! <br> <br>
Same here,   Applelight. I'm one of those narcs that refuses to even tolerate drugs after what they did to my best friend in middle school. <br> <br> <br>But a euphemism too,   right?  <br> <br>Get over it,   old man.  <br> <br>
I have a sudden need for a fic in which Rarity is a doomsday prepper. <br> <br>
Discord is most adorable pony. Hands down. <br> Discounting Sweetie Bot. I have a motherbucking love for Sweetie Bot <br>Wait...we have a new guy?  why can't it ever be a girl?? <br> <br>
REDACTION: STEVE MAGNET IS FOREVER MOST ADORABLE PONY <br> <br> <br>
Fanfic time,   errebuddy! <br>
You mean like THIS◊ kind of fabulous? <br> <br> <br>
Avert thine eyes,   ye who are not worthy! Avert them! <br>
Also good. <br> <br>
Damn,   my viewcounts on <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FIMfiction" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FIMfiction">FI Mfiction</a> are ugly again.  <br> <br>
With such winsome ways,   it's a wonder why I stick about.  <br> <br>I sure hope not. 'Cuz I'm pretty sure I gave y'all a whopping case of the "C" disease. <br> <br> <br>For the last time,   NO!  <br>/slowclaps/ <br>Congrats. You just made me break a teacup. <br> <br> <br>D'aww. /hugs/ <br>Hahahahahaha! <br>Now you have the cooties! <br>@ Keg <br>It's fine. I broke it in a bout of laughter,   and it's just a chip.  <br> <br>Derpibooru isn't working in my browsers either. <br> <br>
@ Thirikal <br>Want it or need it? <br>Perhaps,   BOTH <br> <br> <br>But Twist is best filly. <br> Please forgive me,   Sweetie Belle <br> <br> <br>Get behind or get...behind? <br>/waggles eyebrows exotically/ <br> <br>
@ The Librarian <br>We had a similar thing happen to our Golden not six months ago. <br>Just know that we're there for you,   okay? <br> <br> <br>It would still be nice if they did something,   ya know?  <br> <br>
Forever this <br> <br>
@Whatshisgame <br>Huh. That's odd. <br> <br> <br>I'd have to argue for the latter. It'd be much more interesting to write or headcanon about. <br> <br> <br>I can see your point. Perhaps it could be in a post-Romanticism Equestria that focuses more on analysis and deconstruction after some sort of great calamity. <br>
Mai leetle poni... <br> <br> <br>That could work,   should they have the technology and the interest to make "movies". <br> <br> <br>My personal headcanon is that Discord indirectly caused the unification of the three pony tribes,   or was already defeated by the time that they united. It's all part of this fic I keep trying to write... <br> <br> <br>Or they were split on the issue and started another civil war,   so Celestia and Luna had to clear it all up... <br> <br> <br>Keep bringing the puns,   bby. <br> <br> <br>The universe is conspiring for me to ship Twixie! <br> <br>
I've only recently changed my avatar. Feels good,   like putting on a new skin. <br> <br> <br>Link? Cuz I love me some older CMC fic. <br> <br> <br>
Thanks. I'll add it to my "read within the next century" list. <br> <br>
I giggled at this.  <br> <br>Tsundere Rumblaloo? <br>Does this exist or do I have to write it myself?  <br> <br>
Damn you! I haven't watched that movie yet! Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert!  <br> <br>
Don't worry about it. Current trends indicate that the next derail will happen approximately...after this post. <br> <br>
Why hello thar,   Steven. What's the haps? <br> <br>
Definitely Rarity and Twi. Rarity because she is best pony and I think she'll get along well with me,   and Twi because I need SOMEPONY to do my Calculus work. <br> <br> <br>You could try it. I used to do it for dA points back when I was but a wee chillin on the interwebz. <br> <br>
Threaten to break their legs! That always worked for me! <br> <br>
Clop? There is no such thing as clop. Don't be silly,   my little ponies. <br> <br>
I find writing commission fics to be really fun,   because I work better with a full outline — even if it's not my own. <br> <br> <br>You better not. I'd twist your pitch so hard that you wouldn't even be able to recognize it. <br> <br> <br>Hey! That was MY idea for his birthday present.  <br> <br>Nighty night,   everypony... <br> <br>
I currently have 60$ in my checking. Swimming in it? Not so much... <br> <br> <br>I'd do that workout. <br> <br>
@ CDRW <br>Excellent! <br> <br>
Pony thread creates and fixes so many problems... <br> <br>
@ Ace <br>I have a need for those SHOES <br> <br> <br>That's MY answer! Wait,   no. My answer involves sharks and blackjack and hookers. You know what,   forget the sharks. <br> <br> <br>I am essentially Bender in that I need alcohol to function,   yes. <br> <br>
It's like happy hour,   except no one's drunk 'sides me.  <br> <br>
That sounds suspiciously like what I used to do in my teenage years. Kick them in the taco and get them outta there! They're probably nothing but trouble. <br> <br> <br>Wowzers. <br> <br>
As an "older" fan,   I think it's great! I have so many more people to talk to about ponies!  <br> <br>
Dammit.  <br> <br>
D'awww  <br> <br>
Or she's just an amazingly awesome Mary Sue character from an abandoned fanfic. <br> <br> <br>Mmm... Biscuits. <br>Thanks for reminding me that I haven't eaten yet.  <br> <br>Calm yo tits,   Apple. <br> <br>

i don't know anymore. my bad.  <br> <br>I got to admit,   Applelight x Pinkie Pie is pretty much canon.  <br> <br>Night,   sweetheart.
@ Morningstar <br>Pretty much. Have a terrible headache and my mouth tastes like cat,   but I commented a little on your chapter.  <br> <br>
Just one of the side effects of me drinking too much. Always happens. <br>@ Keg <br>Aww... That's possibly the nicest thing you've said about me. Other than that you were sorry that you said I had chlamydia.  <br> <br>
It's really creepy,   but I'm now imagining it too. <br> A pirate ship holding a pony?! Preposterous! <br> <br>
Me! <br> <br>
I only like heist movies if they're comedies,   like Wanda.  <br> <br>Just discussing heist movies now,   I think. Nothing much. <br>What's the haps with you? <br> <br>
Well,   it's fic writing time.  <br> <br>I have a need for this now. <br>/sighs/ <br>Looks like I'll have to write it myself.  <br> <br>
Shipping Rin x Pinkie Pie now,   and you can't stop me.  <br> <br>Maybe not over that. Maybe.  <br> <br>It really was. I noticed it and was like "Huh? Did they do that on purpose?" <br> <br>
I call her Ditzy Doo in fics,   with "Derpy" being a really pervasive nickname. <br> <br> <br>/adds another to the potential fic list/ <br> <br>
I LOVE The Goonies! It's one of my favorite children's movies of all time! <br> <br>
@ keg <br>That sounds awesome! Like a real life dungeon crawler! <br> <br>
Yea,   your story is going to be great! <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Don't worry about fitting a certain genre. I've had some trouble with my fic not going so well either,   and I just pushed through it and kept thinking. Hopefully the guys on the fic thread can give me some help. <br> <br>
No problem,   dear.  <br> <br>I spit out my tea laughing at that first one.  <br> <br>I'll probably see it on <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTube" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTube">YouTube</a> too! Maybe we can all have a movie night?  <br> <br>
Thank you for being a gentleman,   Ace.  <br> <br>Woo! I still haven't missed 15000! <br> <br> <br>Kinda sorta not really. <br> <br>
Yup,   same.  <br> <br>It's a good idea. Maybe you could propose it on the RP thread? <br>/hugs NES back/ <br> <br>
@ Syd <br>That made me glad I woke up this morning.  <br> <br>
We're gonna make it to 15000 tonight! Too bad I'm going to bed. <br> <br>
ANOTHER GIRL ANOTHER GIRL ANOTHER GIRL <br>Also,   it's a Posey icon.  <br> <br>Don't listen to Steven. He's a liar. The biggest liar. <br>/liarjack face/ <br> <br>
But who is 'The Claw' if we're the alien toys? <br> <br>
THE CLAW <br> <br>
THE CLAW DECIDES WHO STAYS AND WHO GOES <br> <br>
I think I scared her off with my estrogen. <br> <br>
You are just full of wonderfulness today,   Irish.  <br> <br>Silly William. Everypony knows how fast the MLP thread moves. She must've seen our post count. <br> <br>
If we dealt in likely options,   we would probably not be on an internet forum and instead be outside or something. <br> <br>
But Celestia's behind it.◊ <br> <br>
/eats plushie/ <br> <br>
Dark? Did you post in the wrong thread? <br> <br>
I dig this whole Satyr trend going on. <br> <br>
Conversation here follows a non linear,   time-wime,   something doidle. <br>I wrote a paper on it. <br> <br>
Sleepy time now. I'll never see 15000... <br> <br>
I am dissapointed. <br> <br>
That is flipping adorable,   Ace. <br>@ Keg: Why? <br> <br>
I tend to ache a lot after exercise because of a disorder I have. It gets so bad that I couldn't keep up with my kickboxing practice and I had to quit. <br> <br>
I used to be on my college's team,   but I can't do it anymore.
Even walking for too long gets me all achy,   so I just sit around on the computer getting fatter and fatter. <br> <br>
That Fluttershy plushie is adorable. I just saw some of the licensed plushies on the news,   and they don't look half as good. <br> <br>
I am forever inspired by crafters' dedication to this fandom. <br> <br>
Congrats,   Kalloon! <br> I'm dating someone too. Heehee. <br> <br>
Hello there,   Star Swirl. <br> <br>
I'm just thinking of the Las Pegasus buffets. Mmm... <br> <br>
It'd be a shame if it didn't come out in your country,   Ace. <br> <br>
/hits ed with cheese wheel/ <br> <br>
Mmmm... I love me some purple drank. <br> <br>
Just came back from the spa,   as a matter of fact.  <br> <br>Welcome back,   d Roy.  <br> <br>HOLY SHIT DON'T YOU IDIOTS DARE SCARE THIS ONE OFF. &gt;:( <br>I mean... heya. <br> <br>
Most of the people here are dudes,   and the only girls I can think of that post regularly (and please don't be offended if I forget you) are myself and Princess Gwen. <br>Oh! And Rainbow! Thanks for the catch,   keg.  <br> <br>Damn! Forgot Turtlebutter and Ilse. My bad! <br> <br>
That really sucks,   sweetie.
But we're all real friendly here.
And Applelight gets REAL friendly sometimes.  <br> <br>Goodnight,   Wyoming. It was nice to meet you too.  <br> <br>My dad insists on pronouncing it "main-gay". <br> <br>
I have no idea. <br> <br>
By Jove,   you're right! <br> <br>
BEST OC OF ALL TIME. ALL OTHERS STEP DOWN IN SHAME. <br> <br>
Hurrah for awards! <br>Wait...what are we talking about? <br> <br>
Today is a good day  to die? <br> <br> <br>You need a massage or something,   dear. <br> <br>
That's why you're my favorite,   Purple. <br>Referencing one of my favorite actors. <br> <br>
Horses terrify me. <br> <br>
I didn't really like G2. Too...real. <br> <br>
Wheely Bopper is the best OC I've ever seen. But she'll never replace Rarity in my heart as best pony... <br> <br>
I never knew that I needed that until now,   Blissey. <br> <br>
In a dark fic,   you have a chance? <br> <br>
I have a D&amp;D manual. <br>D&amp;D is for NERDS,   Apple. Not bronies. <br> <br>
Welcome to the thread,   Kix.  <br> <br>If you're good enough at making your audience not vomit from pony,   you can do anything with pony. <br> <br>
I would like to second that D'awww. <br> <br>
I demand Rarity because she is sister to best filly.  <br> <br> <br> <br>
I personally ship Snowflake x Pony Obsessed With Tubs of Jelly. <br> <br>
BUHAHAHAHAHA! I'M BACK,   BITCHES! COWER BEFORE ME,   AS I HAVE RETURNED MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER!
In actual news,   my sister recently had her first child (an ickle baby girl) and I've been helping her out. That's why I've been gone. <br> <br>
@ JT <br>Not only am I an aunt,   but I am the BEST aunt (aka her only aunt,   as the rest of my siblings are male). I've been really into crocheting lately,   and I recently crocheted the entire mane six for my new niece. I wanted to keep them for myself,   but I can't say no to a red and wrinkly face like that... <br> <br>
Ah yes,   the Ballad of Applelight and Posey... <br>What legends?  <br> <br> <br>I'd take a picture,   but I'm about five hundred miles away right now.
Well,   I DO knit so that could've happened. <br> <br>
I found the link to the guide I used,   so you can have a clue as to what they look like. Just like that ,   only a little shittier. <br> <br>
@ Syd <br>Funny you should say that she'd eat us. My sister just texted me and told me that little Baby-poo is already trying to nom on Fluttershy. <br> <br>
I can confirm that she's in a terrible clopfic. <br>No linkies for you. <br> <br>
Hey Thiri. What's the haps? <br> <br>
Cranberry oatmeal cookie is best cookie. <br> <br>
YOU BASTARD <br> <br>
Yay! I love that game! <br> <br>
She's looking a lot better,   Applelight. <br>I really like her mane. <br>/is shot/ <br> <br> <br>I don't even have an explainable reaction to this. Mostly,   I just took my head away from the screen and went on a nice,   long walk. <br> <br>
Good for you,   Pannic. I'm sure that your visit will really make his day. <br> <br>
That tends to happen around these parts. <br> <br>
Eeyup,   Syd. <br> <br> <br>Stop giving me fic ideas,   dammit. <br> <br>
Good day to you too,   honey. How's it going?  <br> <br>I see. Well,   PM me if it all gets too much for you. I simply CAN'T have my smoochie-woochie feeling down,   can I?  <br> <br>How's your fic coming along? <br> <br>
You're just jealous.
At least you have a job.
I'm just a poor college student who has too much time on my hands. <br> <br> <br>Ha! All my years of calling people that have finally been validated! Yes! <br>
WHY IS THERE NO WAY TO UPVOTE ON TVTROPES <br> <br>
SWEETIE BOT? WHERE <br> <br>
Aren't ponies almost always naked? Or is it that she's riqsuely dressed? <br> <br>
I keep getting errors whenever I try poking my nose into Derpibooru... <br>Hmm... <br> <br>
Night,   smoochums!  <br> <br> Is there a ponifed version of DDR? I'd play it. <br>I THINK they like it,   but I don't speak Portuguese. I'm more of an Asian languages gal myself. <br> <br>
I loved Rainbow Brite. It wasn't the love of my childhood like MLP or that cute boy with the lazy eye in fifth grade,   but it was all right. <br> <br>
I actually LIKED Equestria Girls. I don't get all the "trauma" and dislike. <br>Oh. And hi there,   NES. &lt;3 <br> <br>
A couple of people in my nerd girl groups hated it. <br> <br>
/insert crass joke about the moon here/ <br> <br>
Hiya,   dark.  <br> <br>I would imagine it would make one feel rather small in the grand scheme of things. But of course,   I know nothing about Equestrian Astronomy. <br> <br>
/is an astrophysics major/ <br> <br>
Me too! /squees alongside dark/ <br> <br>
My headcanon is now that Rarity used to be a "Gorgeous George" style boxer. <br> <br>
I used to kick-box,   ya know. :V <br>SWEETIE BELLE! <br>/made my day.jpg/ <br> <br>
Never played it,   Morningstar. Heard of it though. <br>Btw,   working on that Pinkie helps out Rarity based on the Pinkie Pie botique line of toys thing that you wanted.  <br> <br>Hush,   partypooper.  <br> <br>
I'm really only fluent in Javascript so... <br> <br>
I know that feel,   Irish. <br>I wasn't really impressed by the episodes of Lucky Star that I watched either. <br> <br>
I guess,   Story. I'm much better at web design though. I personally find coding pages very soothing. <br> <br>
Me too,   Wyrte. <br><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTube" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTube">YouTube</a>...I saw it on  <br> <br>
Agreed,   Kyler. <br>Except,   of course,   the part about liking Lucky Star. /put into spoiler because obvious <br> <br>
Meh. Too slow for my tastes. <br>
Cheer up,   buddy! You've got possibly human tropers to type back and forth with on the interwebz! Always puts a smile on my face. <br> <br>
Princess Tutu for the motherbucking win! <br> <br>
@ Syd <br>Yowza. You have my sincere hopes that everything turns all right. <br> <br> <br>Sorry to hear that,   Applelight. <br> <br>
My schooling is going well. I'm on the Dean's list!  <br> <br>So's mine.  <br> <br>Wi-Fi is good.
I doubt I could live without it at this point. <br> <br>
Yeah,   thereabouts. <br> <br>
HELP WATCHING KOREAN ROMANTIC COMEDIES AND GETTING EMOTIONALLY INVESTED HELP <br> <br>
AGGGH PUNCH THAT BASTARD IN THE FACE FOR JUNG MIN,   HANNA! <br>...help. please. <br> <br>
'Course not.  <br> <br>
How anyone could dislike you is beyond me,   Applelight.
But yeah... uh... <br>How about them ponies? <br> <br>
...I'm confuzzled. <br> <br>
well im drunk and lost 50$ in a geme if strop pokker. <br> <br>
watd a wonk <br> <br>
gnighy,   everyybody. :) <br> <br>
Ugh... At least I didn't hot the taco all over the place. <br>Anyways,   I have a hangover. How's everybody else doing? <br> <br>
Gotta agree with that. <br> <br>
I think your suit looks pretty good too.  <br> <br>You got a computer for going to your orientation?! Damn,   son! I wish I got something like that. All I got was a little flash drive and a pencil.

            @Apple: I'd refrain from it for now,  just in case we find out anything more.  At most,  I wouldn't want to go into detail,  just out of respect.  Whatever the details are,  they're highly personal and we should be careful about spreading the news.
<p></p>@Flea: I'm just glad we were able to make her life a bit more enjoyable.  At the very least,  it's good to know that she liked hanging out with us.  Thank you for letting us know.
