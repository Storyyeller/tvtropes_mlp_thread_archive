            @Zel Well,  CMC got promoted to main character status,  and actually got character development and focus to match individually (except for poor Scootaloo). Of course,  this is an opinion that I <em>know</em> I'm in the minority on. Most people really would like to have seen less of them.

            Generally,  in an ensemble slice of life like this,  it's quite impossible to avoid character exaggeration if they aren't the focus of the episode.

            @Zel: Yeah,  Season 2 focused too much on the CMC and not enough on the ensemble casts.  The rewatches have made that even more obvious.  S1 was generally better at incorporating the other mane cast members into the plots even when it was obviously focused on certain ponies.
<p></p>And yeah,  I was the guy who did the reviews.

            Yeah,  I didn't like the CMC at <em>all</em> in S1. I always skip "Call of the Cutie" and "The Show Stoppers" is just barely watchable (mainly for the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a> song and Twilight's epic reaction at the end).

            CMC only had 4 where THEY were the focus,  2 for AB,  one of which also fetured a lot of another minor charcter and gave us epic worldbuilding,  and 2 as the CMC.
<p></p>Sisterhhoves was to much about rarity and AJ as well for it to count as a CMC episode.
<p></p>and season 1 also had 4 CMC episdoes,  one just AB,  2 pure CMC,  and one that split the CMC and Mane 6 equally,  while ginvng epic backstory.

            <div class="quoteblock">I don't want to start this discussion again,  but if you think Twilight was Flanderized,  then you're ignoring all of the times she acted neurotic in Season 1,  especially when it came to anything dealing with Celestia. Swarm of the Century and A Bird in Hoof being the primary examples. Also,  if she really was being Flanderized,  then she would have acted that way all the time in Season 2 and not just when something was worrying her (two episodes out of twenty six). </div>
<p></p>Well my main complaint is that <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LessonZero" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LessonZero">Lesson Zero</a> was way more exaggerated than anything that happened in season 1.

Also,  "The Cutie Mark Chronicles" was focused on the Mane Six. You're mistaking "appearing in an episode" for "being the focus of an episode".

            My main issue with the CMC episodes in season 2 is that they're almost all of the "the CMC get into shenanigans" variety.  Every one of the episodes is "the CMC get themselves in some kind of problem and deal with it"; and they don't usually develop a whole lot.  Sisterhooves Social was awesome because it actually focused on their interactions and relationships with other characters.  They need more episodes that deal with that rather than treating them as a group.  Not one of the episodes really deals with them on a character interaction level; we need an episode with more tension within the group.

Don't worry,  dude,  I'm with you on this one.
<p></p>Episodes like <em>Family Appreciation Day</em> and <em>Sisterhooves Social</em> showed us that they're getting at least better at characterizing the girls beyond "waaah,  we want our cutie marks NAO!"

            poeple are just exaggerating how much the CMC are in play,  yes they were in more episoes,  but they weren't the focus of it anymore then season 1 once you factor in how late into season 1 they were introduced. And half the CMC episodes ALSO had some focus on worldbuilding and/or other background/minor ponies.
<p></p>Yes they popped up more in non-CMC episodes but why not,  they are two of the Mane 6's sisters.
<p></p>As to les ensemble,  yeah I'd prefer more,  but by NOT having to add scenes/lines for every pony it allows them more time to focus on developing the one or two ponies that the story is bout,  season2's only issue there is that they had to many wihtout any ensamble,  vs season one where almost all of them were.

            Eh,  I'm on the fence about the CMC.  I think the girls themselves are adorable,  but their actual episodes tend to annoy me.  I think its because,  being kids,  they're challenged by stuff that looks stupid or harmless to older viewers so there's less ability to emphathize.

            @Kyler: It's definitely an improvement from season 1,  but I still think that they need to focus more on using the characters individually; the CMC are too much of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastHerd" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastHerd">Cast Herd</a>.  Sisterhooves Social was great,  but that wasn't really a CMC episode anyway,  and outside of that only Apple Bloom has gotten episodes to herself.
<p></p>@Moe: That's the issue for me as well.  They're amusing,  but they just cause different kinds of conflicts than the mane cast does.  It probably works fine for the target audience,  though.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I think it's because she's probably the most self-aware character,  so it's easier to own struggles with her faults. Most of the other characters screw up and then learn what they did wrong.  Rarity screws up,  realizes it on her own,  and then tries to fix it.
