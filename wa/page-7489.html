            @Cheerilee: It's a bit of a joke at Keine's expense. You see,  she has a bit of a Were-Hakutaku condition,  so she becomes a were-hakutaku at the full moon. (Hakutaku is this Japanese mythological creature known for its wisdom.)
<p></p>Because she grows horns during that time,  people have been cracking were-cow jokes at her expense,  and then when they began crossing over <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Touhou" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Touhou">Touhou</a> with Equestria,  they found Iron Will and the Joke wrote itself.

            Well considering that he and his partner possessed two of the deadliest things in the Wasteland between them and only showed up in the final few chapters after being talked about on the radio,  how the hell do you propose that someone could have beaten him? Actually <em><strong>think</strong></em> before deciding you don't like someone just because they don't get beaten by someone at some point!

            @Librarian I ALWAYS think. I didn't think he should've appeared AT ALL.
<p></p>Or,  here's an idea,  maybe he could've been beaten... DURING the finale! I HATED that finale because almost everything went exactly according to Pip's plan so I didn't care... AT ALL.

            @Librarian My Problem with the Enclave has ALWAYS been that they were shit antagonists. It's my primary complaint with the whole god damn fic. Autumn should've been introduced BEFORE the chapter where he's defeated. The Wonderbolts too.
<p></p>I was annoyed by the arc at first purely because Red Eye died,  but on repeated readings I've found that I actually really like it,  and the final confrontation with Red Eye is my favourite scene in the entire fic.

            I agree on the Enclave being bad antagonists (introduced at the finale instead of earlier in the story) but since the Enclave was focusing on Red Eye at the time during the finale and Littlepip had a friggin' <em>dragon</em> on her side,  you can hardly expect them to be able to put up a more decent fight. Spike even lost an eye! How is that not satisfying enough for you?
