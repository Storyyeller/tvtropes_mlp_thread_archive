They're actually pretty adamant that they will finish it. The only one they have left to really finish to a large extent is Rainbow. All the others have voice actors and we've seen them in action. They plan on having the first release be just the mane six and add the other 11 they have planned later. Also,  Fluttershy's theme is probably coming soon. <br> <br>@AHR. Difficulty settings don't always help though. Most of the time,  they do what Kegi mentioned and just buff up stats.

            @MR AHR: Actually difficulty levels don't really add challenge,  they just tend to scale things. So instead of the enemies becoming more challenging they just become tougher,  or more powerful or numerous. It's easy to assume this makes the game more challenigng,  but in practice the effect can be anywhwere from making it more tedious to making it borderline impossible because you get swarmed.
<p></p>@blue: Oh,  I understand that. I'm in no way defending how the industry chooses to go about it. While I myself am guilty of often designing to coddle players,  We really ought to respect them a bit more than we do,  and trust them to handle a decent challenge.

I bet Pinkie would get along with Peacock. <br> <br>But no,  Pinkie's a charge character apparently. Focuses on random timing to confuse the enemy,  not just being random. At least,  that's the impression I got from watching her.

            I love the way <em>Thief</em> does difficulty levels. On the lowest difficulty your only objective is to go in and get to the thing you're trying to steal. But higher difficulty levels add more objectives - generally they add that you need to <em>get out</em> with the loot as well. You're also tasked with stealing a certain amount of money and goods and higher difficulties also restrict use of physical force. Sometimes they add other loot specific loot objectives,  like,  say,  stealing a guy's prized silver fire poker.

            A lot of games do the No Checkpoints thing on their highest difficulty settings. But that's not really challenging,  it's just unfair and frustrating.

            <em>Prey</em> basically just took away health pickups on the higher difficulty. Of course on that game it's kinda impossible to die unless you die early before you get the "spirit" stuff,  soooooo...
<p></p>With <em>Painkiller</em> the difficulty levels had some effects. On "Nightmare" difficulty the checkpoints don't restore health,  and on "Trauma" the enemies don't drop souls,  meaning that A. you're entirely reliant on health pickups in the level and B. no Demon Morph,  so you rely on the tarot cards when you want to go into super mode. In that game,  lower difficulties also restricted what levels you complain - for example,  "Prison" is only available on Nightmare difficulty and "Forest" is only available on Trauma. Though the last chapter of the game is cut out on Trauma.

            @mars I'm annoyed by other things. and I like other characters who act like Kamina in other shows.
<p></p>That's where my obsession with finding things that match my very limited known preferences came from. I want to be as sure as I can <em>possibly</em> be that I'm going to enjoy at least PART of something before I watch it.

            In my mind,  <em>fun</em> needs to come first in a game. Difficulty can be a source of fun,  but it's not the only source of fun,  and difficulty can turn right around and be frustrating if done wrong.

<p></p>Hell,  I prefer easier games myself,  at times. I like the powerful feeling. All I meant is that we need to acknowledge we aren't going to scare away all of our players by giving them a challenge. Yes,  some of them don't like that,  and that's fine. But there are a lot of middle ground players who are almost never challenged and would enjoy it if it came.

            @Enlong Everything. His manerisms. His manner of talking. His random sayings. His "fake coolness hiding a damaged interior" thing. His whole character from the ground up pissed me off more than anything I've ever felt before or since.
<p></p>Not even PINKIE compares (though her in chapter 16 of CEQ came close)

            Difficulty setting. I prefer  games when I control character (like FPS),  not just give it orders (like strategies) when I rely on my manual skills I prefer  to challenging,  and I trying to start playing at medium setting and switch to hard  (unless they do something stupid like no normal save,  I will play lower diff setting). I strategies and some <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGs">RP Gs</a> I prefer lower setting when I have all perks and no handicap. I wish computer was just better tactician/strategist but in those games it's only faster and have better stats and reasorces that's unfair to me.
