            So,  auditions for "My Little Musical" are closed. I sent in my audition about a month ago - hopefully I'll be on the callback list when it's posted.
<p></p>Man,  I'm a dweeb.

            No,  it's the thing with the OC ponies and the whole conflict between ponies and dragons or something. I just know I auditioned for the antagonist OC pony that is apparently a baritone.

            @Teeth Meh,  could be worse.  I have the radio wake me up and the one station I used to tune into had a lot of Dairy Queen commercials.  Well,  they happened to be running that stupid flamethrower burger commercial where the guy waits 2 seconds,  then starts screaming.  My alarm turned on somewhere during that 2 second pause,  so I woke up to some guy going "AAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!" at the top of his lungs.  I was not impressed.
<p></p>Anyway,  if anyone remembers that dress I designed for Phoe,  <a class="urllink" href="http://no-contest-creations.com/2011/07/13/phoe_gala_dress/">I finally got around to colouring it<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.  I'm really happy with how it turned out.

            Another week of reading fanfiction and it seems to me that "Celestia becomes the Nightmare Sun!" is the most common fanfic idea that doesn't NEED to involve shipping. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>It seems a lot of fandom is showing something fandoms often show for something you start to like when you are a little kid and continue to like as you grow older - when you go older you somehow want the show to be the same,  yet you want it to be more "<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">adult and serious</a>". Except here people START as twentysomething males who like the show for little girls. (I'm sure there some trope for the phenomenon... I just can't remember what it is called.)
<p></p>This is not a diss on Grimdark fanfic. Fallout: Equestria is excellent,  for instance. And for some reason I find a lot of the Cupcakes-based John Pinkie Gacy fanart hilarious...
<p></p>It would be really fun to see more relatives and friends of the main cast next season! Not everyone need to have them alive or present,  mind you. It's not unrealistic for there to be at least one parent who is absent among six twenty-year-olds in the real world,  so that would be OK. And for some reason I would be OK if we met new friends/rivals/enemies of the main cast instead of bringing back old ones. The one exception is that I would like to learn more of Luna. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">

            It's just a symptom of all fandoms that grow sufficiently large. The fanworks grow to encompass every area of the sliding scales of whatever. Of course,  we only <em>really</em> notice those that fall somewhere outside the range of where the source goes,  because it's different. Lighter shows get darker and edgier,  darker shows get lighter and fluffier,  serious shows get lulzy fanworks and vice versa.

            It's better in that it gives an excuse,  I suppose. But as ideas go I think they're about on the level. Writing isn't about the quality of idea,  it's about pulling them off effectively. If it's done well,  I don't really care about the idea.

            Well,  let's think.  Season one had around two for each of the girls,  if I recall right,  and some that focused on certain groupings within the mane six - Applejack and Rarity,  for instance,  or Dash and Fluttershy.  I don't remember the exact numbers,  but a similar spread for season two would be nice.

            how do you mean focus episodes? Like,  episodes focused on a single cast member?
<p></p>I'd think...maybe around 1 focus episode to three or four group episodes? Most of the mane cast is pretty established,  though that doesn't mean focus episodes can't still be fun,  but I'd like to see enough for the character who've kinda slipped past the limelight,  like Applejack. Twilight,  I think,  needs a focus episode too. She had,  what,  Winter Wrap up and the pilots? The individual CMC members could use a focus episode as well,  for much needed character development.

<p></p>Personally,  I'd like to see a high number of ensembles with the entirety of the main six.
<p></p>Although I'd like to see some extra focus on Applejack,  since she got a little shafted on those toward the end of the season.  I think Pinkie and Rarity could each do with some extra share of the pie too.  And,  of course,  being the biased Twilight Sparkle fan I am (well,  at least as much as I can be,  given that I like all of the main six enough that my ranking is borderline meaningless...),  I'd like to see something around her.  However,  since she was typically around in just about every episode in season one,  I won't be too heartbroken if we get more of that instead of having her steal the focus more oten.

            You can define a focus-episode however you like.  If you want all Cutie Mark Crusaders episodes,  go for it.  If you want a split between individual and the whole cast,  go for it.  If you want 24 episodes of Spike and Owlowlicious say it.  You can even say you want episodes covering the Elements of Harmony if you like.

            Twilight don't need much focus,  she is in all episodes,  and in most of them she have big role. She have most of character development. As fan of Twilight (:D image saying that line year ago) I don't wish for more of her in show because she is mane hero of MLPFIM.

            I feel like most of the cast got a pretty balanced number of focus episodes,  even if the distribution was a little off - for instance,  "Applebuck Season",  "Look Before You Sleep" and "Fall Weather Friends",  Applejack's focus episodes,  were all pretty early in the season.

            Yeah,  now that I think about it more she really does have more focus than I first thought. But even still,  much of her development is in relation to the group - she's supposed to be learning about friendship after all. I'd like to see maybe an episode about her alone. We don't get to see much of her as an individual,  like we do with a few of the others.
