            I never really saw her parents showing up unannounced as that big of a deal. A bit surprising but not a big deal.

            I think we might be just dealing with a culture clash with the parent thing.  Yeah,  it's rude,  but I know that at least in some parts of America you wouldn't make too much of it; especially if your parents live nearby and drop in on a regular basis.  If Rarity's parents live in Ponyville,  it probably isn't that far-fetched to think that they drop in on occasion.
<p></p>Also,  did the episode clarify whether they had informed her beforehand about their vacation?  If she knew they were going to be dropping Sweetie Belle off,  it doesn't really qualify as dropping in unannounced.

            I get jittery if my mother touches my door so being angered if parents barge into your home unannounced,  I can understand entirely. Though oddly enough I do not have the same feelings when it comes to my sister,  we're chill. Parents are annoying.
<p></p>Even though they're pretty cool,  Barging into Rarity's home was uncalled for You'd think they'd at least wake her up or something instead of letting Sweetie Belle ruin her food and why the hell am I Defending Rarity again?

            @Ginger: No,  of course not.
<p></p>The thought of <em>anoyone</em> coming into my house unnanounced bothers me,  whether they're related to me or not. It just feels disrespectful. Especially since they don't live with her - it's <em>her house</em>. Unless it's just another house that they own and she lives in it's her propery,  and even if they do own it it's still rude. It's basically saying 'I give absolutely no regard to your privacy or sense of personal space',  to me.

            Again,  it's probably a cultural thing.  In a lot places,  people probably wouldn't blink at parents dropping in unannounced unless you specifically asked them not to,  especially in cases where large groups of extended family live in the same small town,  or all in the same part of town,  or whatever.
<p></p>And it's a moot point anyway,  as they apparently informed Rarity that they'd be coming by,  and she just forgot.

            Wait,  this is Equestria we're talking about.  Who locks their doors there?  It's not like there's such a thing as pony murder and pony assault and who knows what else... right?
<p></p><em>Right?</em>
<p></p>Part of the appeal - to me anyway - is that the Equestrian world is light-years more wholesome and pure than our own.
<p></p>Although I still like the darker and edgier stories to a degree.  Does that make me a bit neurotic?
