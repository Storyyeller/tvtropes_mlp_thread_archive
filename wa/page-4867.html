            Isn't it funny how lately we seem to talk about anything <em>but</em> ponies?
<p></p>I mean,  I've seen Castlevania,  Mega Man,  Zelda brought up entirely without Pony context.  But if it allows me to randomly talk about how <em>Ghosts n' Goblins</em> is my new favorite game trilogy,  I won't mind.
<p></p>So,  which pony's plot do you enjoy the most?
