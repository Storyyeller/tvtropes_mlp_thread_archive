            normally yeah that woul be WAY to much even for me,  but in this verse it works and it is explained why later,  and no it is NOT just Pinkie,  every other pony also learns/unlocks some uber-power,  Pinkie just figured her's out early withou really understanding it,  she gets explained exactly what it is and what her limits,  yes it explicitly sets limits on her abilities.
<p></p>and no it is not JUST Pinkie that has tapped into there hidden power just the rest have done so in ways they dind't realize they were doing.

            Is there even anyone who's reading that thing that hadn't made it to that point?
<p></p>Anyways,  I can kinda see why you might find that annoying. It honestly sounds like a pretty boring fight to me anyways,  if there's no challenge. I mean,  <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattles" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattles">Curb Stomp Battles</a> should be done for the express purpose of context - I wrote one for White Brook during TCYB,  and it was actually to set up the <em>villain</em> as badass. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Brook takes out a dozen trained unicorn soldiers with barely any effort. He then fights the main villain,  Iron Towers,  and loses. Iron then turns on Blueblood...</span>
<p></p>A <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> is not a way to work the dynamic of what are supposed to be rivals. It makes the entire relationship seem pointless,  because there's no comparison. That's just bad writing.

If there are really limits made eventually and powers are given to each of the mane six,  then I don't see what the problem is. I know AJ gets some kind of rock commanding ability or something. Would that be wrong because she doesn't show that kind of ability in the show? <br> <br>Also,  I don't see how it's a problem for the author to lean you to a certain false conclusion. Unless they blatantly say something which is then proven wrong later with no explanation,  it's fine. (to me,  at least) <br> <br>Lack of context debate is probably a bad idea for me. <br> <br>So it boils down to you not understanding people's different tastes. There's really no point in any of us trying to convince each other,  then.

            Honestly,  I'd be more concerned with Pinkie using a <em>lethal weapon</em> in the first place than where it came from,  anyway.

            @Ginger: Okay seriously,  some people like stuff that you don't.  If you don't like it,  drop it. Don't rage about it to people who don't agree.
<p></p>@Perpetual: I agree with most of what you're saying.  If it wasn't for people telling me that all the flashback the stuff is going to be explained more,  I'd be a <em>lot</em> less inclined to keep reading.  Yeah,  I know,  building suspense and all that,  and I fully agree that leading the audience to a false conclusion is a valid way to build suspense,  but in this case,  the fact that the means to that end involves a lot of apparent character derailment causes a lot of issues.  If you're going to deliberately mischaracterize someone,  at least give some indication that it's intentional and a part of the story.  If people who had already read it weren't around to tell me otherwise,  I'd just assume that the author is just screwing around.

            And this is where being in the minority is awful. You people keep telling me that having an unpopular opinion isn't bad,  right? That doesn't mean much when people cater to the majority. It leaves people like me shit outta luck and out in the cold
