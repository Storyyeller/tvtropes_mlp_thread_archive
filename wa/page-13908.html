            And a new chapter of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDresdenFillies" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDresdenFillies">The Dresden Fillies</a> is out. (I'm probably horribly behind everyone else,  as usual).
<p></p>Just in case
<p></p><h1>SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!</h1>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After a short landing,  the stairway opened onto something that looked like a cross between the reading room at the New York Public Library and a Victorian business office. Enormous bookcases lined the walls,  the smallest of which was easily two stories tall,  holding thousands,  maybe tens of thousands,  of tomes,  scrolls,  grimoires and any other kind of book you could think up. The shelves were aglow with the auras of a dozen or so unicorns drawing the books off them as quickly as possible,  creating as severe air space hazard to the pegasi darting in and out of the giant room through its doors. Some of the books were going to desks manned by a mix of unicorns and earth ponies to be flipped through in furious study,  but most of them gathered into teetering stacks,  which vanished in flashes cast by a pair of exhausted-looking unicorns. Maybe half the ponies I could see wore hoods,  but the rest were bare-headed,  their faces showing the strain of panic channeled into frantic activity.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The grayscale circus was held barely under control by one dark gray unicorn with steely hair shiny enough to show your reflection. He consulted with the messengers and a circle of ponies around him,  but he still managed to bark orders to the rest at the same time.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"They're evacuating." Bon-bon said a hushed tone. Fear touched her voice,  winding itself into her words. Whatever explanation she had expected for the interruption of routine,  it hadn't been this. "But why?"</span>
</div>
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Good question. Something has definitely gone spectacularly wrong.</span>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"−find the accounts on his fourth incarnation. I think he did something similar when he−"</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"−and even if the Agents' covers were blown,  how did he−"</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"−obvious she couldn't have deactivated that ring by herself. She had help,  and I think−"</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"−looking through Romana's transcripts,  but−"</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"−like a complete madpony. I was barely out of my room,  rushing towards the mess hall,  when−"</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"−because we've lost contact with them doesn't mean−"</span>
</div>
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ok,  so they thing that Twilight had help,  they lost Blackstone,  and apparently their agents are vanishing. That just confirms two things:</span>
<p></p><ol><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The one at the end of that chapter wasn't from the Order</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">There is at least one person knowing about and trying to undermine the Order</span>
</li></ol><p></p><div class="quoteblock">
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Run,  Sweetie! I'll hold him off!" she yelled,  winding up for another punch. A shimmering blue aura caught the hoof mid-swing,  though it cost Rarity a surprised grunt of effort. I began gathering my wits,  and my power,  as Bon-bon tried to explain.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Mom,  this isn't him. We've got the wrong pony."</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">For about three-tenths of second,  Bon-mom actually considered that then her face twisted in absolute horror. "You poor girl. He got to you just like he did that nice Miss Sparkle." Her fury boiled to the surface and she fixed me with the kind of stare that only an angry parent can produce. "If you hurt one hair on her head,  Obsidian,  you won't live another day!" Luna would have been jealous of the volume she reached,  as her announcement echoed down the corridor.</span>
</div>
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The sad thing is,  their paranoia is wholly justified. It's us who have the benefit of knowing who Blackstone really is.</span>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">We didn't have an inhibitor ring,  but Rarity had removed one of my force rings from its elastic band the previous evening. I fished that ring out of my pocket,  hoping that the guard didn't notice what it really was. His colors didn't even flicker from dark gray. He hadn't noticed. Confident,  I pulled off the blanket,  ready for whatever Twilight did.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Only it wasn't Twilight.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This pony was a unicorn,  yes and definitely a she,  but this was not the Element of Magic. I recognized her,  but honestly she was about the last pony I had been expecting.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Trixie?!" Rarity gasped,  reflecting my surprise.</span>
</div>
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Curiouser and curiouser.</span>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Out of the corner of my eyes I saw Rarity approach Trixie,  trying coax her back towards the rest of the group. "Come on. You'll be safer with us than wandering these halls alone. Whatever were you doing in there anyway? I thought you were still under the Princess's care."</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Trixie got to her hooves slowly and hesitantly moved to Rarity's side,  keeping a careful distance from me. Was she scared of me because of what I had just done do the guard,  or was it something else? How much did she remember from her night of madness?</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Trixie's … recovery was completed more than a month ago,  and she was given a new wagon. She was booked for a job within a week of her release,  and put on an excellent show. Trixie's employer offered her a drink after the show,  and the next thing Trixie knew,  she woke up in that cell." She gestured to the closed door and shivered. I doubt it was a lingering chill from her soaking.</span>
</div>
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Oh...Kay... I can sorta see the logic here. Still...</span>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Trixie's face reddened in shame. "Yes, " she whispered,  "they kept asking me about what had happened,  but I couldn't tell them anything. I remember stealing the Elements and breaking them with the hammer,  but everything afterwards is just whispering voices and flashes of emotion." She sunk to her hooves,  shivering again. "I told them I didn't remember how Twilight and her friends stopped me,  or anything about the stallion who helped them,  but they wouldn't believe me."</span>
</div>
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">So that was their plan. Either the spells failed,  or there is no such thing as a memory extraction spell. Which would go in line with earlier chapters.</span>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Trixie and I waited in the hall as muffled voices came from beyond the doorway. Trixie kept glancing at me,  but her eyes darted away each time I looked toward her. Ignoring her,  I focused my heightened senses on the cell,  trying to hear what was going on. So when Trixie finally spoke,  it caught me by surprise.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Intentional or not,  you saved Trixie from that awful place. You have earned Trixie's vast and undying gratitude,  Mister..." she trailed off,  a faint pink coloring her cheeks. "Sorry,  Trixie never caught your name."</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"You can call me Blackstone, " I answered,  utterly failing to pick up on the tone of the question.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Blackstone, " she repeated,  as though she relished the sound of my name. "Thank you,  Mister Blackstone. If there is anything Trixie could do for you... anything at all... please don't hesitate to ask."</span>
</div>
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Uh-huh. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance">Rescue Romance</a> incoming.</span>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">I started down the hall,  thinking that I would keep watch around the corner. I was halfway there when a pony bounded out of the sodden cell. I had expected a mare from the sound of her voice,  but recognition was a shock of its own. It was another blue unicorn,  but this one had a two-tone mane of white and dark blue.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Trixie?" Colgate asked in confusion.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rarity shook the water out of her eyes,  then they widened with recognition. "Colgate? What are you doing here?"</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Rarity?" Colgate looked even more aghast. "What are you doing here?!"</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Rarity,  who is this?" Trixie asked.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Dr. Scott!" I said,  chuckling.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Colgate spun to stare at me. Her pupils shrank to points and her ear flattened against her head in fear. "Blackstone! W-what are you doing here?!"</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Well,  there went my mood. I bit back a few more vicious comments and settled for,  "I'm here to rescue Twilight after you made off with her. And in case you're wondering,  no,  I'm not Obsidian. Now answer Rarity's question."</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Colgate winced,  and Rarity offered a spare robe for her to dry off. "Sorry,  it's just that you were the last pony I expected to see, " she said as she rubbed herself down. "I-I have to admit,  though,  I don't think you're him anymore. Even an idiot could tell you're dangerous,  but Twilight believes in you,  and I've known her for a long time." The dentist sighed. "She thinks you're all right,  and my instincts said the same thing even when I didn't want to listen to them. As for the cell?"</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She shook her head sadly. "I wish I knew. The last thing I remember is going to bed,  then I woke up in there a few hours ago." Fire entered her eyes,  and she straightened her spine. "But I'm going to find out."</span>
</div>
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unless there was something I've missed,  the Order just took the plunge.</span>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">I looked up,  ready to be rushed,  but I was surprised to see the rest the group holding its own for the moment. Colgate was holding off two guards with blasts of magic,  and while she hadn't knocked either of them,  at least she was keeping them busy. Trixie had gotten a rope from who-knows-where and hogtied one guard while she fought another with a sword she'd evidently taken from the first.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rarity,  though,  was the one who deserved the award. There were a total of twenty-four earth pony guards,  so if you do a little math,  you'll realize that while the rest of us were taking two apiece Rarity was left with eighteen trained,  armored fanatics about twice her size and weight.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They didn't stand a chance.</span>
</div>
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">No comment necessary.</span>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Channeling magic apparently made the horn sensitive as hell,  because it felt like he had just kicked me in the balls. My power winked out,  and I gasped in pain.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"I have you now." He said,  his voice curiously androgynous. Later I would have to wonder about his gender,  but for now I was sufficiently distracted by the sensation of ropes being wrapped around my ankles. I started to struggle and I reached out with my telekinesis again,  only to receive a blow to my horn that told me he had pulled the first punch.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Son of a bitch!" I complained. "You assholes don't play around,  do you?"</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The leader of the group pulled me to my hooves and held me there,  displaying more of that surprising strength. "I would not be flippant if I were you. The only reason you are not dead is because I need you. The moment I am done,  so are you."</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">I blinked. That's interesting. He needs me? So far every pony in the Order had been more than happy to try killing me. What made this guy different? I stared into the hood trying to see his face,  but there was only darkness. "Who are you?"</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At first I didn't think he would answer,  but he finally replied,  "You may call me Watcher."</span>
</div>
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Curiouser and curiouser. I wonder if that's Obsidian. In any case,  there really is a power struggle,  no doubt about it.</span>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"We're about to have company, " I growled,  staring down the hallway we had come from.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"You all go ahead. I'll stay behind and hold them off, " Colgate said,  an icy detachment flavoring her words.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"We aren't leaving anypony behind, " I growled. "Even if they're a kidnapping nutcase." My ears swiveled,  trying to figure out which hall the guards were coming from. Damn echoes.</span>
</div>
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">I would have really pondered giving her one of these rune pellets,  knowing whom she's up against. Or a grenade.</span>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The top finally popped open and I pulled the skull out of the specially lined and prepared bag. I had spent a several hours last night warding the bag to make him undetectable. Between that and the more skilled enchantments on the skull itself,  I was certain he wouldn't set off any alarms. Well,  I had hoped at least,  because there was no chance I was leaving him behind at Bon-bon's house.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Tell me what we're looking at."</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Orange lights flared to life within his eye sockets. Bob whistled,  "Now that's a ward."</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Trixie's face twisted in disgust. "It talks?!"</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rarity laid a consoling hoof on her shoulder. "I know. It gets easier to accept with time."</span>
</div>

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bob squeaked,  presumably in fear even though I knew he'd deny it if I ever asked him. "In that case,  put me back in the bag; I'm going dormant."</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"You're doing what?" Rarity asked. I think she was repressing a smile at his reaction.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"For the next twelve hours, " he said,  "I'm going to be the next best thing to dead. Just promise me before I go under that if we get captured,  I have your permission to leave the skull,  no strings attached."</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">I sighed,  but in the end I couldn't refuse him. "You have my permission to do whatever you deem necessary to escape if we get captured." I hoped that wouldn't come back to bite me,  but I refused to leave Bob out to dry. He was a perverted,  arrogant asshole,  but he was my perverted,  arrogant asshole. Wait…</span>
</div>
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That is going to bite him in the ass somehow.</span>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Trixie continued to struggle upwards,  and we tried everything Rarity had done for me,  and a few new attempts. Nothing worked. Exhausted,  Trixie sank to the stones. "Leave me." Trixie said,  her bitterness audible even through her slowed words. "You came for Twilight; go get her. I don't need you. I don't need anypony."</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Horseshit." I said,  plopping myself in front of her on the stairs.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Language!" Rarity gasped,  looking thoroughly scandalized.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Trixie glared at me,  moisture beginning to gather in the corners of her eyes. "Don't talk like you know−"</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"You're right,  I have no idea what happened to you. But I can tell you this,  you aren't going to fix it with self-pity. And if you knew anything about the pony I'm trying to save,  you'd never tell us to just leave you."</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"That's not−"</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"No,  I'm talking now. I know you said you don't remember much about that night,  but let me tell you something,  Trixie. I tried to kill you after the girls blasted you with the Harmony ray."</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The silence is the stairwell was absolute after that statement. Trixie stopped trying to interrupt me and instead stared up at me in fear.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"There was a demon running around,  and it certainly influenced me,  but I had control of my own actions. I wanted you dead,  because of everything you'd done to my friends and everything I feared you would do in the future. The girls tried to convince me not to do it,  and eventually,  when I refused to see reason,  they fought me. To protect you. The demon stoked my rage and I returned the favor. I won. I beat all of them and then I went to kill you. Twilight teleported in front of my attack,  trying to save you,  and it nearly killed her. She went to death's door to keep your sorry ass safe even after everything you had done to her. I will be damned before I let her pain and courage go to waste."</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">I put a hoof under her chin and lifted Trixie's head,  straining against the feeling of molasses.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"I am not letting you lie down and die. You are coming with us,  whether you like it or not."

            @Crowfall: It would <em>awesome</em> and hilarious if Daring Do turned out to an actual character.
<p></p>Been watching Sword Art Online recently. 'Twas an interesting story,  also lol inheriting oldstats from the previous iteration because the designers were lazy and recycled code.

            But would you want her to be like her character in the books,  or should she be a Gilderoy Lockheart type character?
<p></p>I should get back into Sword Art.  I stopped after the end of the first arc.

            @Crowfall: I'd like her to be slightly miffed that the novels ham up her actual adventures.
