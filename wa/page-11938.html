            I feel once again compelled to mention that despite Rarity's fantasies,  she did not approach Blueblood,  he approached her. He was the one who was showing interest,  and was a jerk from square one without her ever having been able to give him any evidence of her intentions. There is absolutely no possible way that he could have been pulling some sort of anti-gold digger deception.

            @Teeth Yep,  and get rid of that pointless chase scene too. Seriously I love Amy Keatin Rogers for all the other episode,  but this was the first time I wanted to ask her face-to-face "WTF LADY?!" (granted it might as well be not her fault entirely).

            Yeah leaving Rarity and Pinkie was cruel, but still more forgivable than what they did to RD in Mare Do Well, or how the writers gave up on trying to explain Dragons in "Dragon Quest". That scene was definitely bad enough, to stop it from the A grade, which I would've given it without that part.
<p></p>Now what do Dragon Quest and Mare Do Well have in common? They were written by the hit-and-miss Merriwether Lewis who wasn't in "Hearth's Warming Eve",  "Putting Your Hoof Down" mode.

            Sweet and Elite was a good episode.  I agree on Dragon Quest being a cop-out though.  The first few scenes set up the idea that we were going to learn more about dragons,  and all we ended up getting was "dragons are kind of awful".  That and it spent too much time futzing around with Spike's whole initiation process.
<p></p>I actually liked the chase scene though.  It probably could've stood to be a bit shorter,  but it wasn't bad on its own.

            @terlwyth The writer you're thinking of is Merriwether Williams,  and she did not write Sweet and Elite,  Meghan <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McCarthy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McCarthy">Mc Carthy</a> did. She <em>did</em> write Hearth Warming Eve and Putting Your Hoof Down,  though,  two of my favorite episodes. I really don't think you can tie general quality to <em>any</em> of the writers specifically.

            I remember Dave Polski was fairly maligned by some fans in season one (<em>Feeling Pinkie Keen</em>,  <em>Over a Barrel</em>). I was never on the hate wagon,  because I thought those episodes were hilarious,  and there are a lot of flaws I can forgive if something is funny.

            "Feeling Pinkie Keen" was fairly middle of the road for me.  It's not one of the greatest episodes,  but it's still enjoyable.  Gotta say I don't care much for "Over a Barrel" though.
<p></p>And yeah,  I definitely didn't find "Sweet and Elite" mediocre.  It's definitely above average.  I don't think it's as good all the other Rarity-centric episodes,  but it's definitely good.

            @terlwyt Wait,  didn't she wrote Hearts Warming Eve too?
<p></p>Anyway,  Mare Do Well I don't think it's bad,  just.... not done very well. I honestly think that the mane six originally had the greatest of intentions,  and when they begun to be to enjoy being Mare Do Well way to much (to the point of making fun of Dash) they realized they were going overboard and decided to end it all by revealing their identities to Dash. Yes we don't see that scene,  but I think it happened storywise.
<p></p>As for Dragon Quest.... no,  it's not a bad episode. The teenage dragons were the only assholes (and I personally think that most of them were like that just to be accepted by Garble),  but even if yes it's quite justified when you think that they don't ive in communities like ponies,  and since it seems they live in the wild too,  considering what kind of creatures are present in Equestria's wildlife,  it's no wonder why they grows up to be tough (which means jerky too,  sometimes).
<p></p>As for Sweet and Elite,  heck no! That was a fairly good episode,  though I prefer Sisterhooves Social the most (even though my favorite Rarity episode,  and a good candidate for favourite episode of all,  is Suited For Success).

The core of it was good,  but it needed to get smoothed out a bit.  It needed either another scene where the rest of the cast tried and failed to reason with RD,  necessitating the MDW ruse,  or a scene where they realize the idea backfired and decide to end it.
<p></p>With Dragon Quest,  my main issue is the wasted potential.  It could have given us a ton of info about Dragons and about Spike,  but we don't really learn anything about him that we didn't already know at the start of the episode.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I don't really hate any episodes either.  At <em>worst</em> they fall into the "There was a good idea here,  but it didn't get utilized as well as it could have".  Even the episodes at the bottom of my rankings have bits in them that make them worth watching.  I.e. MMDW has the peanut butter scene and a buttload of superhero shout outs.
