            Were we just discussing when we got into the series? I joined about a month or so ago,  when by best pal pulled me into it. I had heard a lot about it on tvtropes before that...........let me rephrase that; I had seen a lot of image macros on tvtropes before. So,  I told him I'd give it a try,  and here I am.

            I don't think so - it seems to be rarity's place alone,  considering the entire bottom floor is her shop. And she did say she was supposed to look after Sweetie during Stare Master,  which to me sort of implies she doesn't usually have Sweetie hanging around the boutique. But then,  it's a big building and Rarity was living there as a foal. It's possible that her family just keeps to a different section of the building,  and her parents had a date that night so Rarity was supposed to stick closer to Sweetie.
<p></p>Or,  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">Rarity is an orphan. Carousel boutique is the home that her parents lived in before they died,  so she lived there while she was alone. Nopony new about it because she was always focused on her dressmaking,  and never really talked to anypony else. The first dress she ever sold was to Sweetie's parents,  who found out she was an orphan and adopted her. She moved back to carousel boutique when she was old enough,  though. She loves her new parents dearly,  but she can never forget her biological parents,  and lives in there to keep their memory alive,  keeping it just the way it was when they were still around<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">
<p></p>Hm... concept needs some touching up,  but that could make a pretty decent fic... so long as it wasn't played for too much drama or angst. Dammnit,  I can't be coming up with new ideas again!

            Eh,  as far as we know she just hasn't tried to fly yet. But she also lives on the ground, so there's little reason for her to learn to fly. I'm sure her parents would send her to flight camp if it was really that important to them.

Because I've heard people from either side,  and I haven't seen any proof for either one of them.

            Well that's the thing about her buzzing around; Dash has flown at ground level before,  so we don't know that she didn't just want to hovercraft. It seems to me like that would be harder that just straight-up flying anyways.

            ^Sweetie is nowhere to be seen when Rarity has her breakdown in "Suited For Success",  and it seems like sleeping over at Rarity's is as much of a sleepover as sleeping over at Fluttershy's in "The Stare Master".

The impression I got from the sleep-over was less of a 'lets have a sleep over at a sleepover!' and more of a 'lets sleep over at my place!' kinda thing.  Though,  these ARE just impressions. I wonder if we could ask Lauren on her page....

            As far as ancient history goes - I don't remember what the thread was like back when I started,  but I do remember that the main page only had around 500-600 wicks.
