            @ginger: I do not... how is Canada generally portrayed?
<p></p>I think I know the <em>general</em> idea of it - commonly mistaken for America,  generally polite but can get angry? Or is there more to it?

Hey. LBYS is one of the better S1 episodes. <br> <br>@mars. it wasn't that. It was that the picture was disturbing to a few people,  and we asked him to put warnings on pictures like it. At least,  I don't think ginger got in any actual trouble. Did you,  ginger?

            I don't understand why <em>LBYS</em> gets such a bum rap.  Sure,  half the mane six (and Spike) are absent,  but I like the episode.  Wet mane Rarity,  AJ in a "frou frou" outfit,  literally by-the-book Twilight,  and great character interaction.
