            I just thought of something.  Since we've talked about the Mane Cast in relation to Avatar elements and other things related to other series,  I was wondering what Hogwarts houses the Mane Cast would be in.  Twilight would be an obvious Ravenclaw and Rainbow Dash would probably be in Gryffindor,  but I'm not as sure about the others.  Rarity seems a bit Slytherin to me (she's rather similar to Professor Slughorn in her social climbing),  but she might also fit Hufflepuff because she's very hardworking in her own way.  Applejack seems like a cross between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff to me.  Fluttershy I would see in the same way (the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a> character she reminds me of the most is Neville) and I have no idea where Pinkie Pie would go.

            Pinkie would be in Hufflepuff,  as would AJ I think. Rarity suits a benevolant Slytherin,  RD is Gryffindor and Twi is Ravenclaw.
<p></p>FS I think might be Gryffindor too

            It may be a deconstrution in one element or another,  but it's not a deconstruction of the ENTIRE magical girl genre. The rules of magic in that universe are structured to be mean and cruel. Which isn't realistic either.

            I'm not sure I would call something a deconstruction of the magical girl genre unless it were actually about a benevolent force that grants someone magical power to fight an evil thing. And then they get run ragged because hunting demons and stuff is kind of a full time job,  but she still has to go to school,  and in the end she has to drop out of school to defeat the big bad. And then the rest of the world gets to enjoy their happy ending while the heroine is stuck waiting tables instead of going to college to become a doctor like she wanted to be. But it's okay,  because she gets bragging rights for saving the world,  except no one will believe her because nobody saw a giant demon thing almost destroy the city.

<p></p>Which house would Bartemius Crouch be in? What about Alastor Moody? Mundungus Fletcher?
<p></p>^ I'd say both. Sort of like with <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickAss" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickAss">Kick-Ass</a>.

            I've always been interested in writing a story about fantasy tropes and characters (elves,  orcs,  magic etc) and how they would actually operate in a modern real-world setting (Our world,  to be precise). It would be pretty dang dark.
<p></p>Just need to get off my ass and do it.

            As stated,  Twilight is a Ravenclaw,  but Pinkie Pie and Rarity have Ravenclaw traits as well. Also,  loyalty is a Hufflepuff trait,  so RD joins AJ in the Huflepuff/Gryffindor fusion. Rarity does have Slytherin elements as mentioned. Fluttershy is a lot lke Neville as mentioned,  so she could fit in Gryffindor,  but Neville had his parents condition affecting him and so I think that she could fit Hufflepuff as well. She certainly wouldn't be a typical Gryffindor.
<p></p>As for PMMM,  I don't <em>look down</em> on other Magical Girl shows. I happen to really like Nanoha for example. I just didn't enjoy them <em>as much</em>.

            The masquerade works with smaller numbers,  where it's easier to hide that one slipup,  when it does happen,  as "some hobo getting high on cactus juice". But when there's a lot of you (and/or you're stirring up a lot of shenanigans),  you start to leave more evidence and the chances of hiding your existence as a race from everyone approaches zero.
<p></p>At which point,  you'd best hope you can work out some kind of coexistence.
