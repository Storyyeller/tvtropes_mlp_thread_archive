            Aaaand I saw the new episode.
<p></p>And my throat hurts from laughing at Twilight Sparkle's face at the end.
<p></p>I liked this one. Maybe it's just my good mood,  but I actually found the CMC's utter missing of points to be kinda charming this time.
<p></p>Before the epic "wut" face,  my biggest laugh was at,  "coming up with words is like... really hard." I like that kinda subtle humor sometimes.
<p></p>... And,  you know,  Apple Bloom's dancing and the costumes were actually pretty adorable,  hah.

            I'm sure you guys were likely to have noticed Rainbow Dash going backstage to greet the CMC along with their older sisters. This seems like a pretty strong hint that Scootaloo is her sister,  but I read a comment from Faust that said they weren't related,  and it seemed to imply that the subject would be addressed in a later episode. Maybe it will be when the parents are revealed.
<p></p>What do you guys think,  then? I think it might be a little dark if it turns out that she was adopted,  but maybe it's not entirely out of the question.

            Would her being adopted really be dark? That seems a tad archaic to me...
<p></p>See,  personally,  I always though that Rainbow Dash was from Cloudsdale (or whatever) originally,  so I was under the assumption that she was living away from her parents,  like the rest of them seem to be.

<p></p>okay,  well I guess it's a little dark,  if you want to look at it from that perspective. I just meant that adoption is common enough,  and for all intents and purposes is the same as an ordinary family life. They don't have to address what came before.
<p></p>unless you meant Scootaloo had been adopted by Rainbow Dash? In which case I'd be more inclined to agree with you.

            Maybe she's just a big fan?  Especially after "Sonic Rainboom".  It doesn't seem like too much of a stretch that Scootaloo would go blab everything that happened to the other CMC — which probably had some <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a> when Sweetie Belle heard her beloved big sister <em>nearly died</em> and all,  come to think of it.
<p></p>Then Sweetie Belle would ask her sister about it,  and Apple Bloom talk to Applejack,  and they in turn might drop hints to Rainbow Dash that she has a fan.  Of course that'd make Dash want to meet her new fan herself,  and show her support at the talent show...
<p></p>Incidentally,  are there any background ponies who resemble Scootaloo?  Maybe <em>they</em> could turn out to be a parent or sibling...

            Given that these are rainbow-colored ponies that talk and apparently are capable of building houses and making complex machinery despite having thumbs,  I'm willing to forgive them occasionally showing hints that they're not vegetarians,  on the grounds that there might be some biological differences from real-world horses.
<p></p>Either that,  or the pigs are some variety of pet or zoo animal (I want to say they perform some job on the farm,  but we've already seen ponies themselves pulling plows,  so presumably any job that a human farmer would want a horse for,  the ponies just do themselves because they <em>are</em> horses) and Pinkie Pie eats meat because she's not right in the head.

<p></p>I suppose they could be tofu hot dogs.
<p></p>But I'd really rather just assume these particular ponies occasionally eat meat and it's not a big deal.  It makes things so much easier.

            Goodness gracious,  I'm not sure I would want to assume that considering many of the animals appear to be sentient. Tofu dogs makes plenty of sense IMO.
