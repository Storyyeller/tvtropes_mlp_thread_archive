            You forgot that Gilda stole from a market stand and bullied Fluttershy.
<p></p>Also,  episode was Call of the Cutie.

<p></p>I wouldn't put the blame entirely on Rainbow Dash for what happened at the party,  though.  I mean,  Gilda basically told her to choose between herself and the rest of her friends,  so it's understandable that RD would side with the other ponies.  Being the embodiment of loyalty and everything.
<p></p>I agree that I'd like to think that they're still on decent terms afterwards,  but I think that RD's reaction at the party was justifiable.

            How was it "clear" that Pinkie knew about the pranks ahead of time?  I think quite the opposite,  that she clearly had no idea what was going to happen.
<p></p>Also she didn't "become" mean-tempered.  She was that way before.

            Dash was in flight school,  yes,  but I imagine being born in Cloudsdale is good for learning to fly anyway - you know,  since it's made of multiple layers of clouds that (I imagine) have to be flown between.  Scoots may be able to fly but not want to,  or not like to; if her wings were stunted,  it seems odd that she wouldn't have a sort of 'curse this body of mine that can't fly like Rainbow Dash' moment or two,  but maybe that's a private thing with her.
<p></p>^There would be no reason for Pinkie not to know,  since she and Dash are pretty much the prank co-conspirators of Ponyville.

            That's,  well,  not the point.  The point is you said it was clear Pinkie Pie knew about the pranks ahead of time but the situation is as far from that as it could be.

            All Gilda's reaction shows is that she can't take the kind of stuff that she dishes out.  I mean,  compare it with Dash's reaction when Pinkie pranked her earlier in the episode.  She reacted in a rather good-natured way,  whereas Gilda just got more and more angry.  Granted,  the pranks didn't help the situation at all,  but it wasn't like anyone was intending to get on her bad side.
<p></p>Also,  RD can't really be totally loyal to both sides when Gilda pretty much gave her a "my way or the highway" ultimatum.  Gilda made it pretty clear that she was leaving no matter what; she just wanted Dash to come with her.

            I dunno.  On the one hoof,  I agree that it looks like she can dish it out but can't take it,  but on the other hoof,  nopony <em>else</em> in that episode got hit with a whole roomful of traps.

Her acting in that scene seemed contrived and suspicious. Maybe it was because they were intentionally writing the scene in such a way that we assume the culprit is Pinkie Pie

            @ ginger: I think RD would gladly be loyal to both,  but Gilda made it pretty much impossible by refusing to associate with the other ponies.  It was a natural assumption for her to make that Pinkie set up the pranks,  even though she was wrong,  so her flipping out was a little understandable.  But I'd like to see her come back after having chilled out a bit.
<p></p>RD: "If you don't like being laughed at by your friends at your expense,  I guess that makes you a dick.  And I won't have anything to do with dicks."

            It's just that no one,  not even RD tried to just sit down and ask Gilda about what was going on,  even though that would've had the best chance of succeding. All Pinkie had to do was tell RD that Gilda was being a bitch. Then let the two sort things out.
<p></p>Gilda wouldn't have turned on her completely (She tried to keep her relationship open even while storming off) if RD had just asked: "Could you at least try to get along with my friends? They really are nice people."

After all,  "give them a chance before calling them a jerk" isn't really a bad idea.  The problem is just that Pinkie went straight to plan K or whatever rather than just go "okay,  she really <em>is</em> a jerk,  I should tell RD".
<p></p>The other thing is that I don't really see Gilda becoming nicer as result of RD asking her not to be a jerk; she obviously doesn't care about RD's other friends.  She spends the entire episode trying to get RD to herself.

            ^^^That's just how Pinkie's logic works,  I guess.  By which I mean,  that sort of thing is very consistent with her character,  where in another show it might seem like a rather contrived way of doing things.

            @Teeth: But Gilda <em>did</em> care what RD thought of her. So,  if RD had been the one to tell her that she was being a jerk,  in private,  mind,  things might have gone better. Because Gilda really wanted to stay friends with RD,  she might have been willing to change - but admitting she was wrong,  in front of so many ponies? Ponies that she had just got done insulting? That was beyond her.
<p></p>As for the Las Vegas...Las Vegan? Because ponies are herbivores?

            Yeah,  I can't think of anything to say on the Gilda-Pinkie-Dash debate,  or any Las Vegas puns. How about picking another city?
<p></p>And I'm not sure "Las Vegan" works... it's clear that at least in Ponyville and Canterlot the ponies consume dairy products or products that require them (mainly pastries).
