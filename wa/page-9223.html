            @Mousa: I basically second what Kegisak said.  He chest looks a bit saggy,  and her vacant stare seems a bit odd.  I also think her lips are a bit big,  but that might just be personal preference talking.  And yeah,  there's something a bit weird with the bottom of the dress that I can't quite put my finger on; I think it looks like the dress is just sort of doing it's own thing and I can't really tell where her legs would be.
<p></p>I really like the overall interpretation of the character though; some of the details just need some polishing.  Although I'm <em>not</em> a visual artist and everything I say should be taken with a grain of salt.

            It was actually really fun spending a few hours drawing that picture last night. Too bad I can't really get too many pointers from the artists here,  because I'm using a digital paint app on my iPad (complete with semi-realistic brush-strokes and color blending),  whereas most people here seem to be pencil artists. Ah,  well,  I'll figure it out. At least I can make pretty backgrounds,  so long at they aren't detailed. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            @ginger Well,  assuming you just play the plot and don't spend time fusing weapons or trying to finish the treasure hunt,  there's 25 chapters. The internet says the average playtime is 9 hours to finish the game,  but that might just be a speedrun.
<p></p>Also,  while I was browsing through the chapters,  I discovered Boss Battle. Well,  looks like I have something to do for the next few days other than read fanfics.

<p></p>n a personal level,  my biggest wonk with most armour designs is they emphasize flash over actual usability. It bothers me to see people going around in armour that you'd barely be able to walk in,  let alone fight in. I once took in upon myself to design armour that both looks imposing and would be practical,  but sadly I don't have it anywhere on ym computer and I'm sans a scanner.
