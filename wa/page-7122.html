            the entire point of them was that it was NOT all the pegasi that were a threat,  JUST the die hard Enclave,  even most wing-soldiers could barely stand what they were doing. The Encalve leadership was the enemy,  but they were only a threat as long as enough pegasi followed/supported them,  which most only did out of ignorance. Hence the whole plav for winning was to remove that ignoarnce and expose their lies.
<p></p>Yes as I said it could have been handled better,  but it still fits into the overall story,  and with Fallout.

            missing yes,  but it done so WELL that it doesn't interfere with the story
<p></p>plus it could actually make it better since a lot of stuff could be spoiled or you'd see it coming if you know the Fallout storyline.

            Yes,  and I know exactly how they could've made them better too.
<p></p>They could've had them completely destroy friendship city and everyone there. They could've had Pip's plan fail and the dissenting Pegasi on the other ship relieved of command.
<p></p>... and Autumn could've appeared erlier. MUCH earlier. I still didn't see the purpose of hiding his face

            No,  the Sheild was always a pin ball but he had some sort of magnet device on him so it would eventually come back to him. I think what we all control was simply him apperently able to calculate  the trajectory of the Sheild when it bounces,  which sounds silly.
