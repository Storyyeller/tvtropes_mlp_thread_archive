            @Seraphem: I knew I'd get that reaction.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>@Mio: I tend to think that most of the problems with Discord could have been solved if the episodes had been longer.  If Discord had more time to manipulate the cast he could have broken them manually rather than having to brainwash them,  and it would have made him seem a lot more devious,  and made it less of an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> when he got defeated.
<p></p>@Purple: He's a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a>.  If he can turn his head into a balloon,  I doubt he'd have any difficult shapeshifting into a...suitable form.
<p></p>I'm not sure how I feel about a potential Discord/Celestia ship.  On one hand,  I kinda like the idea that they used to be an item and had a bad break up,  but it raises so many questions regarding Celestia's characterization that I'm not sure whether to headcanon it.

            @JT - I agree with that notion. I think he is a far too major villain to be defeated in just two episodes. If anything,  I think it warrants a whole movie.
<p></p>Also,  while I find Twilight un-Discorded through the letters she wrote THE most awesome moment in the series,  I believe that that card should have stayed in the deck until the show's last major arc.
<p></p>Oh,  and yeah,  I don't really know how this Discord/Celestia pairing would work either.

            well it all depends on how nuts Discord was before the break up,  like maybe he was <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Chaotic Good</a> at one point,  and it was him slowly slipping into <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a> that caused Tia to break up with him,  pushing him into full on villain mode.

            @Ace: I could see that; I just think it would have helped to show the whole manipulation process; I actually timed it out and he breaks the whole cast in about 11 minutes.  You could easily make it twice as long without making it feel dragged out,  and making it more mundane would allow it to stick more.

            Yeah,  agreed that's the biggest issue with the 2-parters.  All of them would have benefitted by being 3 episodes rather than 2.

I find that villains of his scale only really work when they work in the background and/or through proxies. Overt displays of power like he showed make his inevitable defeat even more unbelievable then it already is. It doesn't really help that the heroes. . .were really not all that smart in the episode either.

            I still fail to see the problems. The ponies did the best with what information they had,  and when it came time for the end,  Discord didn't know that they had fixed themselves,  considering how thoroughly broken they had been. And who <em>wouldn't</em> get cocky with unbelievable cosmic power at their disposal?

            @Mio: Yeah,  I definitely agree that he would likely have seemed more threatening if he wasn't so high up on the power scale.  I didn't see any problems with the ponies though; the only real thing they should have done that they didn't was pretend to be under Discord's influence when they confronted him,  and they didn't really even need to anyway.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Also this.  Length of screentime has nothing to do with how effective she is as a villain.  And even then I attribute the issue more to the fact that the writers had to cram everything into 40 minutes than anything else.  There were no problems that couldn't have been solved by extending the running time a bit.
<p></p>Anyway,  I must go. <strike> My planet needs me</strike> It's time for dinner.

            @Lurker,  <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JTeeth" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JTeeth">J Teeth</a>: Really I found it just strange how after they have been brain washed for some reason Twilight doesn't really consider that something may have happened to them (you think turning gray and acting like jerks would be a sign) and just pressed on,  not really taking stock of what's going on. It's just kind of baffling how she doesn't seem to care about her friends acting different,  though really it was just so we could have about five minutes of awkward slapstick,  as the Mane Six (sans Dash) fought with each other and failed.

Rather than jumping straight to "Fluttershy is a bitch" or "Applejack is a compulsive liar" they could have started small and built up,  so it would make sense that Twilight doesn't realize that it's brainwashing until later.

<p></p>But anyway,  my point is that while there are definitely some issues with a lot of material being crammed into a short time,  I still find it impressive that the writers managed to make it as nuanced as it was.  Even though it happens quickly,  the brainwashing scenes are definitely interesting character explorations,  even though they probably should have been drawn out more.
