            I don't think Celestia can get sick.
<p></p>Oh,  fun fact time: here's a little inside joke I learned when I worked at the planetarium. It's said that the formation of the stars in the night sky happened when Celestia got sick. Celestia tried to control the sun while under the influence and as a result,  the sun moved all over the sky. The stars represent the spastic path the sun took during that time.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            @ Sereg (geez two pages ago,   how sad am I?): True enough,  Tick Tock owes Twilight her life. Certainly would explain why Tick Tock is so amicable towards her lately.
<p></p>Another thing I like about CEQ is how creative the characters all are when using their powers. Applejack and Grayscale's fight was fascinating to watch.

            I just have no idea how one combats Pinkie.
<p></p>I mean,  Red only managed to get ANY kind of leg over her when she scared Pinkie... and Pinkie is notoriously hard to scare.
<p></p>Not to mention that Red basically HAS Pinkie's powers,  only they're powered by fear,  not funny. So basically,  Pinkie was the only one who could beat Pinkie -_-

            @ginger I don't want to spoiler it for you,  but I'll say as much that even without that same level of fear,  Velvet is still able to handle Pinkie extremely well and doesn't let a little bit of crazyness stand in her way. She was at drastically low power in Chapter 16 until she figured out Pinkie's weakness,  and in Chapter 21 is able to fight at excellent capacity,  ending up in a standstill with Pinkie due to the way Pinkie sets up the fight.

<p></p>Not really.  Just tell her the party's been cancelled.

We've yet to see Pinkie use her powers against anypony but Velvet,  but on the inverse we've yet to see Velvet use hers on anypony in the Mane group either.

<p></p>Oh wow can you imagine Insipid with Pinkie's powers?
<p></p>This is interesting,  which match-ups do you think would be most interesting to watch?
I wanna see what Insipid does with Dash or AJ's powers.

Havocwing is the fastest which is a big advantage against AJ. As long as Havocwing stays in the air,  she should be able to dodge AJ more easily than AJ can block Havocwing.
<p></p>While the characters aren't equal in power there's a significant amount of rock,  paper,  scissors going on.
<p></p>EDIT: Insipid is interesting against almost anyone,  though Rarity would be the least interesting. Rarity doesn't work well by herself. Next,  the most even and interesting matches would probably be Grayscale/Fluttershy,  Twilight/Red,  AJ/Insipid and Starlight/Pinkie. Curacao and Raity both work better when they have teammates,  so give them Havocwing and RD respectively. (This is assuming that we don't count the other characters which complicates things.)

            It's funny mostly because one could easily make an argument that any one memeber of the two groups is the strongest in their group. Insipid is an interesting case simply because even if her power is limited only to her opponent's,  she uses it in bizarre ways. I can see Insipid breaking the rules of AJ's power and turning into Obidium,  which if it's as string as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shadowstep</span> makes it look is bad,  bad news.
