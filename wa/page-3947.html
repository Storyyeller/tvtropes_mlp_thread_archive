            <a class="urllink" href="../wa/page-3945.html#post-98625">So picking up from where I left off<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>: So now I'm reading the news minutes after waking up (yes the first thing I do when I open my eyes in the morning is grab the  iPod Touch) and saw the post and comments underneath. During this time  I see the mandatory damning of 4Chan and it's existence which doesn't bother me but than a pattern emerges of people who care commenting about this who seem to react not so much out of simply hating them for the lulz or because of their odious reputation thanks to /b/ (I feel they <em>earned</em> that),  but a kind of fear,  which struck me and made think. The way they talked shows that many of them may not have ever really came in contact with the group but may have heard enough from stories read online or passed down from the first group or generation of Bronies (which I will going forward call pre-ban,  refering to the those who became Bronies before 4Chan's ban and the diaspora (call it like it is) that followed) and the Post-Ban (those who became Bronies after the ban) and I include those (in pre-ban) who found the show without 4Chan.
<p></p>As we all know the ban on Ponies seemed to correlate quite conveniently with the rise in popularity of the show and with the core of the fan-base now sprinkled across the Internet,  Bronism ascended quickly. At the same time of course some of the trademarks and established traditions of Bronism that were created before and doing the pre-ban,  era took hold proper in our fan base,  like our own little Nicene Creed or Five Pillars of Bronism (Love and Tolerance,  (adoration of) Derpy,  Fan art,  etc.) and the post-ban group took it a step no a leap further with the Fan sites now being built up greatly. Deviant Art and different streaming sites becoming public forums to view the show actively with other Bronies. And of course the meet-ups which have culminated with Brony-Con.
<p></p>Now during this time more people with from different places,  cultures,  creeds,  etc. have added much to the fandom and after while 4Chan ended its ban on ponies which saw the return of certain bronies who were of a much more changed nature and who,  while still sincerely liking the show were now a bit more cautious and morewisened to how the y would interact there,  for as much as many Bronies may loathe the fact /co/ and to in extent /b/ are the Jerusalem or Mecca of Bronism (<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus">which would make Equestria Daily and Ponychan the Asia minor or Medina</a> for Bronies) It can be denied that the greater representation of the fandom is outside of these sites.
<p></p>So one does wonder what the Bronies who still actively post on the site feel and what their opinions of Orthodox Bronism are. I know form certain comments I read some of these Bronies admitted that while they enjoy the show greatly,  they cannot adhere to some of the more pacifist-like and more dignified principles [of Bronism] on 4Chan,  just not that kind of place to do that and survive (especially considering the fact that they don't have the numbers for that any more). I simply wonder if this shadowy <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Milan">Edict of Milan<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that Moot as issued or if simply time itself will start to reveal a growing schism between Bronies,  not just between 4Chan and everyone else but just a whole rejection of certain ideas of one thing rather it be something as simple as what Derpy's name is to something like questioning the role and nature of Love &amp; Tolerance in MLPFIM or something else entirely.
<p></p>I just hope that we don't see,  although it is inevitable a break down in brought us here in the first place. We don't need a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arian_heresy">Arian Controversy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> over what makes you a brony or a Sunni-Shia-like schism between factions claiming a true link or adherence to the pre-ban era of Bronism. Or maybe it's just not a big deal<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin">,  I tend to over think things<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">. Either way I had a blast writing this and now my mind is as clear as Derpy having a hot muffin waved under her nose.
<p></p>So what do you guys think is going to happen in tomorrows episode? *needs to catch up on conversation that was on hand before writing dissertation*

            @ Ginger Luna isn't incompetent,  and most of the ministries actually worked. Also Celestia had a reason for almost giving up after the Crescent Valley massacre which you don't learn till much later. remember
<p></p>1. This is several years in the future from the show so the Mane Six have grown more.
<p></p>2. 5 out of the six ministries actually worked out and had some good impacts,  most of them just got carried away and took it to far,  and like Watcher said,  they were a great idea,  that went to far. A large part of that was by that time in story the Mane Six were all famous and it was as much a publicity stunt to rally the ponies of Equestria as it was anything else,  and in that it worked VERY well.
<p></p>3. there's issues behind Celestia's grief that haven't been revealed yet.
<p></p>4. The one miistry that really didn't have any impact on the war ( but it's one project ends up being very VERY useful) is Dash's Ministry of Awesome,  and that's because Dash just didn't give a buck about it,  she was to busy on the front lines.
