<p></p>well,  I'm ignorant of the lessons as well,  but that he didn't storm off as usual and that he actually sought to understand Bluespade's point rather than raging is an improvement.

            And just think,  without a new episode this Saturday,  we'll have a whole extra week for this episode to stew in our minds and spark debates about Pinkie Pie's character...
<p></p>Incidentally,  gingerninja,  how many of the pre-<a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a> My Little Pony cartoons have you seen?  I'm intrigued by your insistence that Pinkie Pie is a good character who's often handled badly,  as I've come to the conclusion that Generation 3 MLP's Minty represents everything I like about G4's Pinkie Pie,  while G3's Rarity represents everything I dislike about G4 Pinkie Pie.
<p></p>Of course Gen 3 has its own Pinkie Pie,  but she's a very different character who only happens to have the same <em>hobbies</em> as the new Pinkie Pie.

            Smile represents Pinkie as she can be,  not as she is typically portrayed in other words?  The ideal Pinkie as it were, rather than the living looney toon.

            @Ace: Yup,  pretty much.  Although I don't think RD is quite as mean as that analysis claims.
<p></p>I'm actually more curious about <em>why</em> RD and Fluttershy are so close.  I mean,  it doesn't make a lot of sense for RD to latch on to one of the seemingly wimpiest ponies.

            @ Jteeth:Unless she felt the best way to deal with her crippling fears of abandonment and be her best,  was to have someone she could protect.  At least initially.  I'm sure it grew from there as they matured. I expect part of it matured into a desire to see 'Shy be the best that she can be.  To reach those heights Dashie knows she can reach and realise her own inner strength.

            Just finished watching Call of the Cutie on Treehouse. Censors went and beelped out one of Silver Spoon's lines from the end of the episode. Crazy beurocrats.
<p></p>It's been so long since I last saw that ep that I had completely forgotten it was Dash's idea to try out every riduculous idea that popped into your head in an effort to get your cuite mark.
<p></p>Between Applbloom intimidating Doctor Whooves into an apple purchase and the Doctor's brief cameo in the Hearts and Hooves song I think these two may have shot at becoming arch-nemises.

            @Drenius: My guess is that she noticed that Fluttershy was the only Pegasus who didn't enjoy flying and made it her mission to show Fluttershy how awesome it could be.   It fits in perfectly with Rainbow Dash's dedication to awesomeness and ability,  but at the same time it shows how her love for flying could lead to her approaching Fluttershy: she wants to share it.

I also think she only pushes 'Shy the way she does because she knows that Fluttershy can be better than she currently is,  both emotionally and physically.
