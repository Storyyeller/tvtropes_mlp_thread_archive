            The worst part is that people who complained were vastly outnumbered by people expressing support,  but they still felt they needed to change it.

            @ newguy,  it's been like 15 mins since found out,  of course initial reactions are going to be pissed. I just fucking HATE all this PC bullcrap,  "oh this group might be offended if you do it so you shouldn't do it" There are more people bitching about crap that some people might find offensive,  then poeple that ACTUALLY find it offensive.
<p></p>Hopefully this is just an issue with iTunes and not Hasbro.

            The show goes out of its way to make a gesture to show how much it appreciates its fanbase. It puts in a scene. The vast majority of the fanbase loves it and it's the highlight of the episode.
<p></p>Then a handful of people bitch about "ableism" and now they've gotten it censored.
<p></p>I think we're a little justified in being fucking pissed.

            @ Supior,  don't blame the animators,  this was nothing but stuck up corporate bureaucrats that have no idea about anything but what focus groups and neilson ratings say being scared by the very thought that there MIGHT be a SINGLE person somewhere in the world offended by something.
<p></p>Question is,  were they at Hasbro,  or iTunes?

            Derpy was a kind of nod to the fandom... and the removal of said nod is a kick in the nuts.  Im not going to stop watching Im just kind of annoyed that what is likely the largest demographic watching the show... has just been given the finger by Hasbro.
<p></p>Actually I'd be interested to see what the demographics really are.  Are there more Brony fans than 7-10 year old girls or whatever MLP is targetted audience for?

            again,  don't blame Hasbro till we now it was them,  this could be an issue just with iTunes.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> it is the first time since the animators started intentionally doing so,  they were normal in the few episodes between the pilot and the episodes that were still enough in production to make the change to.
<p></p>and very very few are complaining about the voice,  it's removing her name and the very thing that made her who she is to us.

            @Mousa: Why?  Yes,  it's a little sad,  but she was a nod originally and she's still a nod.  Like I said,  if anyone can get me a good 720p version of the original (I can't find it on Youtube) I'll have the new audio for Derpy (<em>not</em> Dash) synced in five minutes.
<p></p>New Guy's got it right.  Her voice was cute before,  it's cute now,  and this isn't the first time she's been un-walleyed.

            No,  seriously,  what's going on? My brain is dribbling out my ears here,  I'm in no position to go assuming things based on evidence.
<p></p>I mean,  best I can gather is they changed Derpy's voice and removed her name. When the episode aired a portion of the fanbase flipped it's wig,  so they fixed it because that section was vocal,  and now... another section is flipping it's wig? Okay?
<p></p>This is basically the same trick the fandom does every other week.

            Well the part of the fanbase that complained the first time was a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority">Vocal Minority</a>.
<p></p>Also,  they didn't just remove her name. They also changed the eyes. And yes it is the first time she's been like this since Feeling Pinkie Keen.

            @Keg: The itunes <em>Last Roundup</em> was reuploaded with Derpy being given a new voice.  An actual <em>female</em> voice,  not a ridiculously forced male voice.
