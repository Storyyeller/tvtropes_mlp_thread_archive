            Yeah,  my interpretation is very different. I don't think that Luna would have become Nightmare Moon if she had Loyalty,  for example.
<p></p>But as I said,  I think that the Princesses only had one each. Which... assuming that this isn't jossed (and possibly even if it is if my fanverse ends upobviously AU anyway for instance),  will be a plot point in my fanfic series. As the other four former element bearers from Discord's defeat are important.

<p></p>As for Loyalty: Yeah,  I dunno. Those last two are a bit difficult to place. And while she may have had Loyalty,  it is also known that a person can lose touch with their element,  though the thing with Discord was more of a violent flip.

            I know this has been pretty much jossed by the show,  but I like to think Celestia and Luna had four other ponies (not necessarily alicorns) to bear the Elements with.
<p></p>Celestia would totally be Laughter. Luna would probably be Magic due to her having a lot of weird powers (dream walking,  turning into Nightmare Moon at will,  bringing toys to life etc.)

            As to which Princess is better at magic,  i like the one fanfic I saw's idea and it's my headcannon.
<p></p>Celestia had more raw power and can really let fly with the big league speels,  Luna isn't quite as powerful,  but is better with the fine delecate,  subtle parts of magic. Celestia has more power,  but Luna has more skill.

            I don't think Magic is supposed to be literally Magic. It seems to be more like faith in one's friends. Twilight discovered the element when she realized how happy she was to see her new friends there,  and she lost her colors in Return of Harmony when she finally gave into despair and lost her faith.

            @Seraphem: Yeah,  what you say about Celestia and Luna is how I see <em>Cadance</em> with the powers of all three races enhanced and her lifespan lengthened. Celestia and Luna <em>are still greater</em>.
<p></p>On Crystal ponies: Some see them as a variation of earth ponies. I see them as a sepperate tribe.
<p></p>@Purple Dalek: I agree,  but I give Luna generosity (yes,  this means a <em>normal pony</em> gets magic).
<p></p>EDIT: I agree that the bearer of magic is chosen more due to friendship.
<p></p>Also,  Celestia allowed <em>Luna and Discord</em> to be forgotten. So,  it's not unprecidented.

            Made an edit.
<p></p>On Luna's defeat of Celestia: She was Nightmare Moon both times. Luna says that her dark powers were taken away by the elements. I think she beefed herself with illegal magic to become Nightmare Moon to become stronger than Celestia.
<p></p>EDIT: I agree with Enlong.

            I'm under the impression that a thousand years ago,  the Elements were more unionized,  combined into a single or two separate artifacts. The Mane Elements of today are split into six because now six individuals wield them.

Nightmare Moon was simply Luna but with crazy evil eyes.

<p></p>@ Sereg: I see that as she is in charge of the night. Which tends to be dark. The Elements took away most of her magic.

            On the subject of alicorns,  how do you think Cadence's love thing works? Does it create love (she could make you fall in love with a potted plant if she was feeling cruel) or can she only strengthen existing love?
