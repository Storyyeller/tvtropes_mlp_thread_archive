            I like Pinkie more for what she could be than she is. I have consistently loved her focus episodes,  but the rest of the time I'm very ambivalent towards her. My issue is that if the focus isn't on her her character becomes flat,  and is essentially a font of jokes first,  and a character second. When she is in focus she's a wonderfully full,  deep and interesting character.
<p></p>Oh by the by,  don't take much of what I do nowadays <em>too</em> seriously. I'm a bit unhinged at the moment; I'm generally quite stable but it's almost inevitable in the next few weeks I'll crack in some way.

            I really don't have much hope for Pinkie as a characer anymore. She's the team Looney Toon and until radical changes take place that is all she will be. On that note I don't find her particularly funny either.

            I once saw it pointed out that in the G1 episode "Bright Lights",  Zeb the zebra-man actually does slap Megan away with his hoof a few times.  It worked about like what kegisak described.

            Exactly. We're Texans. We love apples. I used to work with farm animals. We have a garden (not an apple tree though). And we're tight-knit. We're also about the right ages (although I'm guessing pony ages are a pretty debatable topic too...)
