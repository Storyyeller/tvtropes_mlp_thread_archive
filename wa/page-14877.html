            @CDRW: I know of one way that people can call her pics OOC: She portrays Mordecai as a loving and caring boyfriend-type,  but in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegularShow" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegularShow">Regular Show</a> he's a lazy jackass slacker who's pretty much the polar oppisite of how she portrays him. Not to mention how I'm sure he'd be less likely to get a long with a unicorn due to his bad encounters with a particular group of unicorns,  let alone dating one of them.
<p></p>On more positive news,  I do sincerly appreciate the Happy Birthday comment from you.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">

            @Sereg: There is nothing wrong with that. I just think that it's has a lotof problems with the way it presented and went about it's story and that the super hero aspect was pretty weak. But really,  my analysis had nothing to do with the actual quality of the episode,  and like I said,  it works in the context of RD's character arc.

            Not to derail this into another MMDW discussion,  but I've always found that the problems were more in the execution than in the premise.  I don't really think any of the events that occurred were OOC,  it's just that the sequence of what happened wasn't written as well as it could have been.  I'm still not a big fan of the episode,  but not for the reasons that a lot of people have.

            I agree with JT that MMDW had some excution problems but there was nothing wrong with the basic idea.
<p></p>@Whatshisgame: That made me LOL. Reminded me a bit of Sunny Skies All Day Long. Rarity's a great friend! She says,  "What a simply terrible outfit!" Is Celestia not so good at transformations? Or does she simply prefer mundane disguises? Presumable with some illusion or enchantment to prevent questioning the horse-sized,  suspiciously dressed figure.

            Thanks Sereg. Also,  I'll be sure to let you guys know what I got for birthday presents once I get them. Last year I got the complete series DVD of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Firefly" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Firefly">Firefly</a>,  the two-disc collectors edition of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Serenity" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Serenity">Serenity</a> and all 3 of the Rush Hour films. I can only imagine what I might be getting this year {And I already have a suspicion that a DVD of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrincessBride" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a> is one of my presents}.
<p></p>On a more pony related note,  I've never really understood what was even remotely religious about Feeling Pinkie Keen despite being a christian. Could someone explain what the accidental "Religious" part of the moral of that episode was?

            For me it was the premise more than anything. Badly worded or not,  having faith and trusting your friends despite the ods is a good moral.
<p></p>But I was bothered with the episode because Twilight was depicted negatively for wanting to study and understand Pinkie's ability. It came off more as a case of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">Dude, Not Funny!</a>.
<p></p>And that sums up my feelings on the matter.

            It's not really a religious thing,  so much as a general,  spiritually-ish,  romantic thing... It could be argued the moral came across as 'You shouldn't try and understand things'. To me it kinda felt like it could have been a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeasuringTheMarigolds" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeasuringTheMarigolds">Measuring the Marigolds</a> thing,  which is a trope I've always found quite frustrating.
<p></p>Of course in reality the moral was meant to be "Just because you don't understand something,  doesn't mean it doesn't exist',  and 'it's okay to not completely understand everything',  which are much more palatable morals - provided the latter is assigned the addendum "But it's okay to try to",  as well.

            I think the moral should have been about keeping an open mind. Twilight wasn't really acting scientifically since she was trying to prove her existing beleifs rather than find out what is true.

She didn't <em>care</em> about how it worked for it's own sake,  she just wanted to prove herself right.  Once she let that go,  she didn't have any motivation to continue analyzing it.

            Yes.  She was being a bad pony of science.  An investigator lets the evidence guide them to a conclusion,  rather than trying to get the evidence to fit their asdumption.  Luckily though she redeemed herself in mmmystery were the situation is pretty much reversed...and it's Pinkie who needed the attitude adjustment.  And a wheel barrow to move after eating that cake...sorry sorry. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_wink.png" height="16" width="16" alt="wink" title="wink">
