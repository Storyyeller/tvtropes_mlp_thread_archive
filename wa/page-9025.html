            @Blissey: Well,  we've actually kind of SEEN their shadows.
<p></p>Dash has some insecurities,  so her shadow would probably be a coward,  and rely on other ponies - Dash's inbred desire is likely to have a pony as loyal to her as she is to others,  judging from how she reacts to be left alone. So her shadow desperately needs somepony to take care of it,  and would likely cloy for attention,  kinda similar to Yukiko's.
<p></p>Fluttershy has a pretty seriously repressed mean streak,  so that's easy enough to see coming out. Her shadow is more than likely Flutterbitch incarnate,  tired of being a doormat and tells everypony exactly what she thinks of them.
<p></p>Pinkie's shadow,  similarly,  is likely Pinkamena. At the same time,  though,  she's probably most similar to Naoto,  or Kanji. She desperately wants someone to see,  and accept,  who she truly is. She's afraid all of her friends are superficial.
<p></p>Rarity's is likely to do with a natural degree of selfishness. It's clearly something that she struggles with constantly,  so her shadow is probably an abusive,  selfish hoarder. She's probably a bit similar to Chie in that respect.
<p></p>Twilight's is probably the trickiest to come up with. Her repressed feeling are probably very scientific ones; some degree of distance,  perhaps the thought that her friends are for her letters first. Her shadow is probably very detached and callous,  maybe even a bit haughty. She clearly is afraid of being seen as vain or arrogant.
<p></p>As for AJ... she doesn't have a shadow.
<p></p>No,  seriously. she's the most stable of all of the ponies. She doesn't seem like she HAS anything to repress. If she does,  though,  it's perhaps the thought that she isn't good enough,  and perhaps some longing to have her parents back. She may resent a childhood lost early to responsibility. But I honestly just don't see it from canon,  really.

            If AJ doesn't have a shadow,  then that would just leave her in the role of helping the rest of them overcome their shadows. Or rather,  she'd take the role of the protagonist? <br> <br><div class="quoteblock">AJ's potential shadow might have something to do with being truthful.</div>
Either that or letting everyone down. She gets pretty broken up about it in Last Roundup,  remember? <br> <br>All I could think of with Fluttershy's shadow would be a Bull-Pony. But then again,  the appearance of the shadows has always jumped out at me more than solely what they represent.

            The shadow doesn't necessarily represent a <em>fear</em>. It's based on the Jungian concept of the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowArchetype" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowArchetype">Shadow Archetype</a>,  a set of repressed feelings. Someone may very well repress confidence and show fear,  for example,  thus the confidence becomes their shadow. so it's unlikely AJ's fear of letting other's down is her shadow,  since she's open enough about the fear that we can't really claim she hides it behind confidence. She might hide it from others,  but never from herself,  which is what repression typically is.
<p></p>And of course the shadows are always designed based on mythological creatures,  which are fun to think of.

            Her greatest fear seems to be failing people,  or failing to live up to her word. We all saw how badly she took the events of The Last Roundup,  even though the others could see that what she had accomplished was impressive by itself. I do believe I remember thinking that it was a very good thing that she isn't a samurai or something.
<p></p>Not having played persona,  but knowing some stuff about it,  I think that her Shadow would thus be something that wallows about in self-pity,  denying the positive aspects of Applejack's personality,  which is,  of course,  the determination and strength of will to strive for those lofty goals. That,  and/or the shadow would symbolize her bullheadedness taken to an utter extreme.

I don't see why she wouldn't have a shadow. Judging by how she acts,  I would say she wouldn't have any <em>trouble</em> with her shadow. She would confront it and admit it fully without any conflict. <br> <br>Bluh,  I don't know enough about stuff like this to really explain things well or come up with ideas. <br> <br>Also Enlong,  you should totally find a way to give the games a try.

            I mean,  I own a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS2" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS2">PS2</a> that I got from a thrift store cheap,  but it's completely borked. It just throws a disc read error at me. I'm going to try to get another from a different source (I wonder if any game stores still sell them?) and get Persona 4 when I do.

            @Enlong: I had to order both my <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS2" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS2">PS2</a> and the game online(I got the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS2" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS2">PS2</a> exclusively for Persona 4),  but it's SO worth it. It's a phenomenal game,  easily one of the best I've ever played.
<p></p>your assessment of AJ's possible shadow doesn't really mesh,  though. Here's a few examples(Spoilered,  since you really should go in fresh)
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kanji tatsumi is a manly,  tough guy. He's also gay. His shadow is extremely effeminate,  a very steryotypical gay man. It rants and raves about how it just wants to do what it wants,  and how it hates women and the like. It's partly Kanji's repressed sexuality,  but it's mostly about the fact that he feels he needs to put on a front and act strong,  and how he hates being forced to move away from part of what he is in order to embrace what he feels he should be. He wants to be strong,  but he wants to be sensitive at the same time.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Chie is confidant,  and protective of her Friend Yukiko. Her shadow is a domineering dominatrix,  hellbent on keeping Yukiko under her thumb and joyful of the fact that she can do so. Chie is envious of Yukiko,  and this manifests itself in her shadow in the desire to be better - so long as she can 'protect' Yukiko,  that makes her better than her. Part of it lies in her personal insecurities,  but interestingly it also has basis in her inherent desire to protect others. It's at the same time a band AND good element.</span>
<p></p>AJ's shadow being her feeling that she isn't good enough simply doesn't mesh because she's never demonstrated anything that would lead you to think she believes that. If she believed she wasn't good enough she wouldn't take on so much responsibility.
<p></p>@Swas: Generally speaking if someone can confront their shadow easily,  it's not really a shadow. She's likely to go the path of the protagonist,  immediately finding her Persona. I mean,  it's still very possible she has some degree of repressed feeling,  but based on what we've seen in canon...
<p></p>Interestingly,  the second choice for protagonist is Rarity. In spite of her flaws,  she shows some signs of <em>knowing</em> what she is,  meaning she's actually partway through her 'arc' already. If nothing else she'd be the first to hit ultimate persona.

            Is it really possible for someone to not have a shadow (that is,  something about themselves that they repress)? Or could it be that there's just another facet of AJ's personality that the show hasn't explored yet?
