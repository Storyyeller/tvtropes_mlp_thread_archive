Yes,  thanks for remembering,  and please post more!  I was thinking about that the other day,  thinking that I should check whether "changeling" could have possibly fit in the blank spaces.  Guess not.  :/

            Were we talking about literary analysis earlier?
<p></p>As an author whose actually seen one of his works <a class="urllink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=tbya1sifi1wu7gg48z9up2bl&amp;page=1">get analyzed<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> I don't have an un-commented version of the story being analyzed right off hand,  but you can reconstruct it by simply cutting and pasting the quoteblock segments into notepad</div></span>,  I'm not really convinced lit-analysis is a valid science,  or even a valid art.  It can be fun as a game sometimes,  though.
<p></p>I have seen a number of recurring themes throughout MLP though.  For an incredibly obvious example,  there is the show's ever-present anti-elitism streak,  with how it portrays "high society" as being almost universally composed of pretentious snobs,  while at the same time showing that the "working class" are all caring,  honest,  well-to-do folk (unless the episode calls for Fluttershy to get depressed and take assertiveness courses from a Minotaur).  This theme is so ever-present it can even be seen in Microcosms.  Think of the Flim-Flam brothers for example:  their dress and style and big machine clearly paint them as being upper-class,  with a strong undertone that they represent corporations (and naturally,  they get pitted against the poor,  hard-working local-flavor Apple Family).
<p></p>Though there is an oddity that seems almost like a contradiction to the above:  the clear distinction between "higher class" and "<em>ruling</em> class."  For some reason,  authority figures are presented as godlike beings who not only have absolute authority,  but are also pretty much universally loved and revered,  at least among their own kind.  You will probably never see a pony (besides Nightmare Moon,  who had extenuating circumstances) who doesn't at the very least <em>respect</em> Celestia,  and if there was an episode that focused on the Changelings I'm sure they would feel the same way about Queen Chrysalis.  One wonders if the concept of "Anarchy" even exists in Pony-world.
<p></p>If I really read into it,  I'd say another theme is naturalism.  Technology,  when it shows up,  is almost always presented as bad—or at least highlighting the negative consequences and extreme potential for misuse.  And let's face it,  the setting is basically a global nudist colony.
<p></p>And now my brain sleepy from overthinking too much.  Me sleep.  Slee—*falls asleep on keyboard*

            Hey,  guys,  just got back earlier today from the Calgary Comic-Con.  It was incredibly disorganized (almost disastrously so),  but I still got a ton of awesome out of it.  Namely that I got to meet Tara Strong.  And I got a couple autographs on two of my best drawings: <a class="urllink" href="http://no-contest-creations.com/2012/04/29/mlp-fim-smarty-snuggles-signed-by-tara-strong/">Smarty Snuggles<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and

And she gave me a brohoof.  AND I got to sing Twilightlicious with her (can you tell I'm still giddy? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">). <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin">
<p></p>EDIT: Argh.  Okay,  the fixed the tags on the second link for the signed pieces.
A few bonus things:
<ul><li>Brought a sketchbook and pencil out to the Con for downtime (which I had less of than I'd thought... or maybe it was that I was more social than I thought I'd be),  so here's <a class="urllink" href="http://no-contest-creations.com/2012/04/30/mlp-fim-calgary-comic-con-2012-misc-sketches/">some random quickies<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li>Wasn't gonna let vacation delay normal art too much,  so here's <a class="urllink" href="http://no-contest-creations.com/2012/04/30/mlp-fim-dark-sparkle/">a villainous Twi<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> I finished up when I got back.
</li></ul><p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_down.png" alt="[down]" title="[down]" height="16" width="16"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_down.png" alt="[down]" title="[down]" height="16" width="16"> Link should be fixed now.  Hmmm,  I guess the perspective might be a bit wrong.  I might have to try that pose some more.

<p></p>FRIENDSHIP!
<p></p>EDIT:  Kuroi,  I'm still having a problem getting your page to load.  It just keeps trying to reload the front page again and again,  like its caught in a recursive loop or something.
<p></p>Note that when I tried loading it in Internet Explorer,  it worked,  so it's probably just a problem with Firefox (I'm using the most recent version).

            Ace: Hehe,  well,  she was signing pretty much anything anyone brought up.  I just had to be patient enough to wait 3 hours in line to get to her. >.>
<p></p>Swas: You mean disorganized,  right?  And,  well,  let me put it this way: the celebrity area had The Next Generation guys in the back corner in their own little alley,  which was fine.  Beside it was the photo op area.  This means both of those sections used the same main pathway to come and go.  Both still fine assuming other accommodations.  Which didn't happen because the potential side route for the autograph area was blocked by the booth selling prepay autograph tickets.  So now the two busiest areas in the Con have at best one and a half avenues for entry and exit.  The photo op lines and some of the autograph lines got busy enough to spill out into the main avenue.  Which left the busiest two sections with about half of an avenue for all traffic.  The bottlenecking was just absolutely stupid.  I'm pretty sure if there was a fire,  everyone in that section would have died.
<p></p>Aside from that,  there was misinformation floating around amongst the Con workers themselves.  We'd ask three different workers the same question and get three different answers.
<p></p>Plus Saturday they got this brilliant idea to,  instead of utilizing both entrances to the Con and distributing people who arrived early evenly amongst both of them,  send all people to one side of the building.  So we could all be bottlenecked getting in that one entrance.  Absolutely brilliant stuff.
<p></p>EDIT: Moe: That's really odd,  because I use the most recent Firefox to edit my stuff.  Maybe you have an add-on that's conflicting with my site's theme's code?

Well,  my sleep schedule is messed up anyway and I'm trying to finish up a paper right now. <br> <br>Oh wow,  I've never been to a con myself,  but that really does sound terribly organized. That seems really sloppy of them. I wonder if there were last-minute changes that caused the problems. <br>And latest firefox here without any problems,  too.

            Swas: The major guests they were planning that all got put in what became the high volume area were all set in stone well in advance.  While the amount of attendees who showed up was much higher than they anticipated (they maxed out and the fire marshal locked the doors),  that floor layout for that section was still just terrible in general.  They probably could have had 1/3 the people show up at the con and stuff run into that ridiculous congestion in that one section once everyone ran over trying to get their photo ops.
<p></p>If I had to wager a guess,  it'd be because most of the people working the con were volunteers.  As such,  they probably didn't have the time to put into planning it properly,  so what we got was just whatever they could throw together.
