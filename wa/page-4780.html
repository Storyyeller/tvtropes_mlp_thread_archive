            These last few major action scenes this season,  Fluttershy picks up the pace to be the other set of wings for the team even she usually is self-proffessed to be a "grounded" Pegasus. She can haul the high air resistance balloon after Discorded Dashie,  just barely keep pace with Dashie when chasing AJ,  and be skilled enough to help cushion Rarity and Spike alongside Dashie by means of a banner.
<p></p>Wow,  it sure looks like she did learn quite a bit at Flight School <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

As said AJ seems to be leaning more into <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStraightMan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStraightMan">The Straight Man</a>,  who is often is more a reactor to another more abrasive character's antic than one who can hold the spotlight on their own. This is possibly why she is considered <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman">The Everymare</a> in her character page,  which is usually the definition of a bland non descript character. Her handful of flawed episodes (and the fact she is a wonderfully rowdy little cowgirl) have prevented her getting that bad however.

            @Psi 001: People keep saying that she is jerkier this season,  but I really don't see it,  so I don't think that Daffy Duck comparison really applies.
<p></p>As for Fluttershy/Rainbow Dash friendship dynamic,  I don't know. People keep saying that they are really old friends due to Cutie Mark Chronicles,  but Dragonshy says otherwise. Like I said,  I'm not really expecting much from their friendship dynamic to come into play (at least positively).

            @Mio: that was just her impatience with Fluttershy because she honestly expected Flutters to be less frightened by a <em>dragon</em>. Fluttershy,  the team Druid who also has massive points in Animal Empathy and probably some in Persuasion.

            Maybe before Twilight came and brought them all together,  Fluttershy was just "this pegasus I know from way back" to Rainbow Dash,  but not much more than that. It's not until they've had crazy misadventures that their relationship became meaningful.

            @Kyler Thatch:That's pretty much the absolute most that  think their friendship spanned pre-Elements of Harmony.
<p></p>I will acknowledge that they are probably better friends now,  but going by a combination of RD's general personality and how she typically gets used in episodes I really don't expect much support from Dash,  even in her own "unique" way.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">That does seem to be case. On the other hoof it does seem kind of odd that RD would really oppose bullies,  or in fact that she herself was bullied so who knows?

            For some reason I kinda like how Rainbow Dash kinda coerces Fluttershy into action moments (eg. Secret To My Excess,  The Last Roundup). It may have more to do with her being the most fitting for the job but somehow I like the idea of her trying to bulk her up as a teammate,  and in most of these instances,  it actually works. Fluttershy even gets an adrenaline boost from it at times.
<p></p>I think Dragonshy was the first real direct interaction they had,  though they were team mates or in crowd scenes together in earlier episodes,  this was the first time they reacted to each other personality wise.
