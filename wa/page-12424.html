            Wasn't aware that Too Many Pinkie Pies was enough to constitute 'spoiled'. I mean don't get me wrong it was <em>good</em>,  but not exactly leagues above the other episodes we've gotten so far.
<p></p>And honestly,  trickery wasn't how I predicted it going down at all. I kind of honestly expected they would find a way to get it into Trixie's head just what she was doing,  or get her to fight it off. As she said at the end of the episode,  she was aware of what she was doing but couldn't really stop.

<p></p>Replace TMPP with "doesn't really care for the two central characters of the episode",  and that probably explains my feelings on the episode.

            No no,  he said he was spoiled as in 'I expected everything to be as good as Too Many Pinkie Pies and have been disappointed'. I honestly can't bring myself to think of TMPP as being a whole lot better than the other two episodes we've gotten. It was decent,  but hardly spectacular.

            I preferred One Bad Apple to Too Many Pinkie Pies for some reason,  but then again I prefer Party of One to Too Many Pinkies. The Higurashi Door Scene just sells it. USO DA YO!!

<p></p>The main thing I think was a problem with this episode was the fact that Trixie's apology scene could have used about thirty more seconds or so,  but the show is strapped for time as it is and they did pretty good with the time allotted.

            Yeah,  they actually probably could have lost the whole "Saddle Arabian" thing and used the time for that.  Would've given more time to the characters.
<p></p>And yeah,  I did not expect Twilight to beat Trixie by faking her out like that; I had thought that she's use her intelligence and inherent skill to win because Trixie was powerful,  but not as skilled.

            Well,  Zecora taught Twi how to midgame better,  no doubt Twi has been teaching herself self-control as a consequence of learning Sombra's Dark Magic,  <em>and</em> Zecora has helped Twi improve her <em>concentration</em>,  which was previously one of her weaknesses.

            @Esp Well,  the orange spell was really difficult for her,  and even her best (and accidental) attempts were incomplete. Aging is much more powerful than that,  and apparently gender swapping is outright impossible for a unicorn (eat it,  fanfics).

            R63 is possible if you have a precise enough transmutation spell,  a potion,  and a sample of genetic material from someone else. Zap the sample and change the chromosomes between XX and XY configurations,  then dissolve the hacked sample in the potion and use it as a delivery agent to effect the change.

            Just watched
<p></p>Who's the cloaked figure? Trixie?
<p></p>Twilight?
<p></p>Zecora?
<p></p>Huh,  never seen an EP with that manestyle before
<p></p>Did he just say Alicorn?
<p></p>Wonder how she get all that money? And yeah,  probably Trixie
<p></p>Lol at <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Mama Bear</a> Fluttershy and her biting her hooves
<p></p>Fanon about Trixie being humiliated confirmed and working on a rock farm was great
<p></p>Okay,  I loved the icon taking Pinkie's mouth and putting it in the trash
<p></p>Ooh,  Owloysius
<p></p>Oooh,  Parasprite. But did she make a new one,  or teleport one from wherever they are?
<p></p>Oh,  wow at that mustache
<p></p>Do Snips and Snails still like her at this point,  or are they just scared of her?
<p></p>Well,  time to see what happens with the town now that Twilight lost...
<p></p>That laugh
<p></p>So,  that's how she makes her leave
<p></p>So,  Twi's training with Zecora?
<p></p>Looks like the cakes are taking their children with them when working
<p></p>Applesauce facial?
<p></p>Interesting way of concentrating
<p></p>Is Trixie making things dark and windy just to be evil?
<p></p>Aww,  poor Fluttershy
<p></p>Trixie's the only one who can take it off? This could be interesting...
<p></p>Fluttershy's scared expression is rather amusing
<p></p>And she was doing it just to be evil
<p></p>Huh,  Trixie let the beavers through.
<p></p>And I thought the beavers were just going to be a distraction so Fluttershy could get out somewhere else
<p></p>Oh wow at Trixie making the chariot larger
<p></p>"I want to be brave at home! Locked in my closet!"
<p></p>I have a feeling the others are going to get involved,  but not sure how
<p></p>I have a feeling Twi's amulet is going to be a fake
<p></p>Mayor Mare's in a cage
<p></p>Aww... that was so cute
<p></p>And AJ looked like Granny Smith there
<p></p>Duplication and summoning spell,  huh?
<p></p>Canon!Genderbent!AJ?
<p></p>"Eeyup"
<p></p>Ah,  so that's how she removed it
<p></p>Sweetie Belle,  Apple Bloom,  Fluttershy,  and Big Mac,  and Granny Smith? Well that makes sense
<p></p>And this is probably going to spark more Twixie
<p></p>Trixie tripped
<p></p>Twilight confirmed for being able to break the 4th wall?
<p></p>And it cut out right before Pinkie spoke
<p></p>And now to catch up...

            Fluttershy definitely wasn't the load. She found the book (only for others to completely ignore her; that was pretty jarring). Her outburst at the very beginning was quite shocking and reminded me of the famous mood swings from Higurashi. She did have to be dragged by her animal friends most of the way,  but performed flawlessly in the subsequent battle. One thing I would have liked to see is Fluttershy having an internal battle between her inherent fears and wanting to accomplish the mission because it was so important.
<p></p>I really like how Trixie was used in the episode. The necklace,  coming inherent with demonic possession,  reminds me of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDresdenFillies" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDresdenFillies">The Dresden Fillies</a>,  which actually increased my enjoyment from the episode. Hopefully she will be brought back in the future,  on the main character's side this time,  possibly in a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment.
<p></p>Zecora's Yoda training was a nice shout-out and I hope she becomes one of Twilight's (or possibly Rarity's) magic teachers. That has a potential for awesome.

            Two more things I remembered:
<p></p><ul><li> The first scene might be a possible shout-out to Iron Man's Mandarin.
</li><li> When Twilight used the duplication spell I was sure she had actually cast Mirror Image. Actually using Illusion magic would have been awesome,  but I guess that's more Rarity's thing. Speaking of which,  is her mastery of illusions canon or fanon?
</li></ul>

            @Sinclair: Rarity was using straight-up illusions during the encore fashion show for Hoity Toity,  and she also knows real transmutation spells (transformed branches into brush carvings in Look Before You Sleep,  turned one of Trixie's stage curtains into a dress in Boast Busters).

<p></p>Rewatched the episode,  it was good. Dig the Star Wars shoutouts to Dagobah and Yoda's training.
