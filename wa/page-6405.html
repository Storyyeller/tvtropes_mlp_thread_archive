            mmmmidway through season 2? It really depends on how you take him. He starts his conversion sort of around the season 1 finale, ,  but it's mostly in a 'fuck over Zhao,  who's the main threat' way.
<p></p>It depends on you,  really. I always liked him for a variety of reasons. You might like him more when he interacts less with the Gaang or the villains.
<p></p>So,  pony tails huh? Are we talking the hairstyle,  or the actual tail of a pony?

            I tend to wear a ponytail when I'm working on something,  otherwise I'll let it loose. I don't really do anything fancy with it,  though,  just tie it back. My mum used to braid my hair every now and again,  and some girls from school used to like to play with it. I never minded all that much.
<p></p>@Orion: Yeah,  but... we all know where that would lead,  and to be honest I'd like to take a break from the 'weird' today. I'm not exactly in a fantastic mood,  you see...

            I think that episode is what truly got me into the series. Before,  when I was a young and dimple faced young girl (13),  I would only occasionally watch the show. It wasn't until that episode that I really began to watch the show. I can't really recall exactly why though. It was probably <strike> shirtless Zuko at the end</strike> the possibility that someone who you thought was bad was not as much of a monster as you thought.

            yeah Iroh is friggen AWESOME,  and he only get better.
<p></p>Zuko does start fairly bland "I must find the Avatar,  I must restore my honor" over and over and nothing else. Come Season 2 he starts to grow and loses that obsession,  and by mid way through season 3 he's done a complete 180. Really the point where he really starts to change is the episode Zuko Alone,  from tehre it's just a conflicted rollercoaster,  though very very well done,  you can understand the differning needs and wants that divide him and how he's struggling to find the path he wants to take.
<p></p>Yeah he is a really well done character,  but again most of that doesn't come into play till later half of season 2.

            Well Ginge,  of you're a hormonal teenage girl then you're supposed to love him instantly. For everyone else you don't like him until season two when he gets a character development upgrade,  and then throws it all away due to manipulation from your soon to be favorite character.
<p></p>By the way,  skip the series finale,  it's rather disappointing.

<p></p>Zuko is a great character. You might not personally like him or the choices he makes,  but I think a lot of people can appreciate the writers and the thought they put into creating that kind of character.

            If by great you mean one epic well choreographed fight scene but almost every story and character point sans Azula's was stupid and nonsensical,  then sure,  it was "great".

            Maybe I would've liked him more if he'd been more competent and evil from the start and then slowly got better. but I honestly don't get that. To me,  he started off both pathetic and a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>. He basically started halfway through the character arc I was expeting of him.

            Yes. Especially considering how he hasn't gotten through Season 1 yet either <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> I view him more of a tragic figure. If he was incredibly competent at the beginning,  he would have no reason to switch sides and his story wouldn't be as tragic. He just fails so miserably. All the time. One can't help but feel kind of sorry for him.
