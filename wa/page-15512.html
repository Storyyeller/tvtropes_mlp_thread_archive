            Despite have been watching anime,  all those gigantic eyes and all,  for nearly 20 years now,  I'm still too fixated with anatomy. It's funny; when I watch any cartoon,  it doesn't bother me too much for the most of the times but when a fanart messes human anatomy up,  I get rather annoyed.
<p></p>I think I need to broaden my scope of analysis/criticism/etc regarding humanizations.

            Just finished watching the first episode of Button's adventures,  while the animation is pretty decent but I really can't stand Buttons at all to quote the Nostalgia Critic: "It's like if Popeye were to smoke an entire Malboro factory!" Any hope of liking Buttons is just automatically thrown out the window and seeing as I have not seen the episode he came from anyway so that really doesn't help his case.

            @Apple: Rarity looks great,  AJ looks more pudgy than stout,  if that's what you were going for.  The combo of wide face and wide body gives her an overall thick look. Not sure if that's intentional or not.

            I think AJ's body shape feels too much like a circle,  if you're going for "stout" rather than "plump". It should be more like an inverted triangle,  or maybe a rectangle.

<p></p>This is pretty dang funny,  but I can't tell whether or not I actually <em>like</em> it... Button treads awfully close to being pretty damn whiny. But then,  I guess he's just acting like a kid,  so fair's fair there.
