            Well,  I got tired of waiting for Chrysalis,  so I just went out and clubbed a Changeling and fed it to that expecting mother.
<p></p>You know what she said?  She said "It tastes like burnt charcoal.  Can I have more?"  I swear you can't argue with pregnancy.
<p></p>Oh,  guys,  Fluttershy said she wants a human to help her keep the animals.  Who wants to be adopted?

            Speaking of Surprise,  I got news for ya'll:  a new chapter of "Surprise Days" is finally finished!  Also I <em>heavily</em> rewrote the preceding ones.  Read more about it <a class="urllink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=13092259580A88860100&amp;page=352#8800">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.  The newest chapter is a story all about Fluttershy.
<p></p>Tomorrow I'm gonna try to submit this all to Equestria Daily,  but I hope to get some revision suggestions and comments while I'm here.

            Okay,  so the Return of Harmony FINALLY premiered on Treehouse today. No editing as far as I could tell here. I can definitely tell the animation is a step up from what I've seen from past MLP episodes. And those balloons are a bit creepy,  to be honest. Overall: Meh. At least I know it exists. Or you could just ignore this post and pretend my avatar is Slowpoke.
Also,  at least now there's at least now 9.9% of the posts on this thread I can now view without having to worry about spoilers against 8.7% before.
<p></p>Also,  do not complain about the hiatus you're having for Season 3. It took <em>11 months</em> between seasons in Canada just for Season 2.

            @ginger: Well,  the villain for the first half of the series is never defeated until the final few rounds,  and the villain for the second half <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is an evil god who very nearly wins</span>.
<p></p>The protagonists actually lose about as often as they win,  and the loses tend to be more devastating. The characters are pretty likable,  the races are always awesome and the parts out of the races are great too. the animation is absolutely stellar,  and the story itself is pretty awesome. It's a great searies,  I downloaded it to watch a while ago and I pretty much burned through it in a few days.
<p></p>Also the episodes titles were alliterative,  yes,  but they still followed a [verb/adjective] like [competitor] format,  so that's why the videos reminded me of them.
<p></p>I just can't help but imagine what each of the girls racer's would be like. I imagine applejack in some giant,  tank-like monstrosity billowing smoke,  Rarity in some crazy motorbike,  and Dash with basically just a jetpack to accelerate her flight speed. and Twilight is pretty much like that wizard dude from the finals. Pinkie and Fluttershy are more questionable,  but Shy is probably riding some kind of animal,  like Aika did.

            @x86x 2: Just watch them on youtube. You can find all the episodes on there,  and you don't have to sit through Barney to watch an episode. It's alot easier and less frusterating.

            So my element is still Misery.... I know I said I had a microscope sitting next to me earlier but I just went to use it and the moron who used it before me left it covered in oil.... even lenses that arent supposed to have oil on them.
<p></p>Long story short,  the body fluid I had painstakingly set up to read was ruined and I had to painstakingly set it up again... and clean the microscope..
