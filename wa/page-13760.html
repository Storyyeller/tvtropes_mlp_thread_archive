            The name "Sunset Shimmer" makes her sound suspiciously like a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a> of "Twilight Sparkle"... I wonder if this means we're going to get the Unicorn equivalent of "Wonderbolts Academy" in the upcoming season.

            There's the idea of Twilight taking on an apprentice. That could be a way introduce a "new mane character" while not suddenly revealing a new Element of Harmony.

            @Hsere: Interesting notion... I had actually been considering that recently myself. It's possible that at the time Luna and Celestia were born and raised Starswirl was simply more well-known,  though - bear in mind that they would have had to bee born at least one thousand and say,  30 years ago,  and could go back much,  much longer than that. IT'd be pretty hard to find the average person who knows what a historical figure from 1012 looks like. Now,  if from your perspective they were a historical figure from 30 or so years ago,  that's different. Luna could merely be commenting on the fact that a lot of history has been forgotten by the average pony.
<p></p>There's also the fact that we don't know the princesses are officially a part of the royal line - strictly speaking there <em>is</em> no real royal line by virtue of their immortality. Blueblood is a prince,  but Games Ponies Play hinted at that being more comparable to a Duke than a true prince. Plus,  Twilight was promoted to a princess when she achieved alicornhood,  so there's really no saying that Celestia and Luna weren't just a couple of exceptionally talented mares who kinda moved in and were promoted to princesses after beating Discord.

            @Applelight: All I've decided about Season 4 so far is that if the first episode doesn't involve Twilight flubbing a landing,  crashing into a tree,  and getting stuck in it by her horn,  I will be severely disappointed.
<p></p>Bear in mind,  Twilight is my favorite pony and I'm okay with Twilicorn so far.  But that gag needs to happen.
<p></p>@Kegisak: Yeah,  those are definitely other possible explanations.

            @Librarian: Then maybe I can help.
<p></p>As for alicorns: Celestia said that Twilight was the first to ccomplish this,  implying that she's the first ascended rather than born alicorn.
<p></p>I still say that there is more evidence that Celestia and Luna are simply ridiculously long lived rather than immortal.
<p></p>Star Swirl's time being pre-alicorn reign does not preclude it from being pre-alicorn. Luna <em>could</em> have met Star Swirl as a filly. I still consider her less than fully grown <em>now</em>.
<p></p>And Blueblood being a Prince in no way implies that he is <em>the crown</em> Prince. Not to mention Shiny's comments and information recieved about alicorn Twilight imply that Equestria has multiple Princes and Princesses (which isn't even unusual in real world countries with monarchies anyway).
<p></p>EDIT:<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I'm not. She's already clearly a better flier than Fluttershy. I'd rather they <em>used</em> that than try to cover it up.
<p></p>As for Sunset Shimmer,  the parrellel to Twilight Sparkle in name is obvious. Likely very important.

            I really like the idea that Celestia and Luna ascended to alicorn-hood,  but Celly's line in "Magical Mystery Cure"—that Twilight's ascension was something that has never happened before—rather clearly disproves that theory. Pity.

            Unless...their ascensions were different somehow?  Like to ascend to alicornhood,  you must do something that has never been done before for the benefits of others?

            @Meta How does that mean that Celestia/Luna didn't ascend? It just means that Twilight's method of achieving it was unique.

            @Sereg: I always took Celestia's comment to mean that Twilight was the first to ascend inside of her natural lifespan(Strictly speaking,  since I also posit that she had to die in order to actually use the power she unlocked).
<p></p>And yeah,  hence why I say that Prince is probably analogous to a Duke in this setting. Prince of Canterlot,  Prince of Crystal Empire,  Prince of Manehattan,  etc.
