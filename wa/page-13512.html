            I think it's partly due to...that thing in question. But I think it's also general stuff,  since both the show and fanbase have matured for some time now,  stuff is going to change,  as are people's opinions of it. I know a few fans who have seen Season Three as a case of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Seasonal Rot</a> (and even Season Two beforehand).

            @Mio: Yeah,  I wish people would just admit that the bronies aren't necessarily any nicer than any other fandom.  There are plenty of nice bronies,  of course,  but saying that the group as a whole is superior in any way is just pointless because,  well,  it's the internet.  There are plenty of bad apples.

<p></p>Havent really been keeping up with season 3. The only episodes I've watched in full so far are Trixe returns episode and the episode about Scootaloo's nightmares. I liked those episodes actually..
<p></p>So what things besides the spoiler have happend to set everybody off?

            And I still maintain it is. Yes not wholly,  but everywhere,  I have found better,  nicer,  kinder and more accepting people then anywhere I've ever been. is it universal,  no. But overall,  this fandom HAS been extraordinarily welcoming and accepting. Yes that does seem to be fading a bit as we grow bigger,  but to me,  the core is still there.

            The fandom isn't falling apart in the least. It's just undergoing a shake-up at the moment. Quite possibly a much-needed one.
<p></p>I think you're being more negative than the situation warrants though,  Red. While its not surprising that there's self-entitled assholes and horrible drama here just like anywhere,  I've been constantly surprised at how much digging I had to do to actually find it. In some places a lot,  in others,  not so much,  but always more than I expected.

            As i've pointed out many manytimes. The amount of complaining and talk ABOUT the hate and drama. far FAR eclipses the ACTAUL hate and drama,  making it seem far larger hen it is.

            The latest episode's conclusion didn't satisfy me as much as the previous conclusions to the last two episodes.
<p></p>I was mostly HUH that the inspector considered it an unvarnished welcome when ya know... the ponies treated the other pony so welcomingly cause they thought she was her.
<p></p>Now,  had they continued treating her (like royalty) even after they found out that she wasn't the inspector,  I'd be impressed.  But they practically just left her.
<p></p>It would have helped had one of the ponies stayed behind to escort her to the spa afterwards,  but nope - they abandoned the mustang pony.
<p></p>But,  I was impressed by how Rainbow Dash took the fall.

            All the stuff that's come up has been making me wonder,  in a purely hypothetical sense of course,  what it would take to get doujinshi laws in the US like what Japan has. As far as I can tell,  Japan's copyright and trademark laws give a whole lot more control of IP to the creators,  which somewhat paradoxically,  means that we get more high-quality fan creations because they don't have to defend their territory so fiercely.
<p></p>I honestly don't know what the view of the U.S. public is on the situation beyond the internet. My guess is that there's not enough interest to get the ball rolling. There's also the fact that U.S. policy is being brought more in line with standard international policy. There's been some changes in the last few years that took a whole lot of music that was once in the public domain in the U.S. out of it. It's not exactly the same issue,  but it does seem like negative progress and a good indicator of what we can expect in the future to me.

            @CDRW: There have been some efforts recently to move IPs over to the publishers,  which would effectively kill,  or at least damage,  doujin creators and events like Comiket.  High-profile manga artists have been pushing against it,  though.
<p></p>Interesting thing to consider,  though.

            Then again,  with the rise of increased file sharing,  public awareness of copyright,  and many international events about the subject,  it's becoming much more noticeable Not to mention the struggles for the spreading of free information have become a lot fiercer  out of backlash against the restrictions on IP. Either way,  I think it's utter insanity that the Public Domain entrance year hasn't been extended from 1923 for over 15 years. We shouldn't have to buy something 70 years old at this point.

            I can't tell if I should (when I have money) get the comics on the IDW app,  or see if I can get the issues from a local comic/game shop.
<p></p>Problem is I don't think the game shop will have all the issues in stock at the same time. Probably only the most recent one.

<div class="quoteblock">Which forum? Bronies.de?</div>
Yeah; today I did do a quick skim-through of the German magazine thread there,  and the only magazine works I noticed were episode adaptations rather than original storylines.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">...whoever <a class="urllink" href="http://www.toyark.com/news/attach/1/9/9/9/My-Little-Pony-Toy-Fair-2013-031_1360451576.jpg">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small> is.</div>
That'd be Ribbon Wishes,  a G3-turned-G4 pony introduced in Blind Bag Wave 5—she "loves to wish on shooting stars!"
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">OOC: Well fuck. Orion is much older than Rainbow.</div>
It's a common background pony thing; you could justify it for Orion via his time travel adventures,  but it'd be kinda odd to give a reason for only him out of all the flashback-appearing common background ponies.
