            I found a rather amusing scenario on <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a>.com:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
<p></p>From “The Sun,  the Moon,  and the Stars: the US-Equestrian alliance in World War II.”
<p></p>“The most important problem facing any Equestrian military planner was,  of course,  the roughly 500-mile radius of the Equestrian “bubble” in our space-time. Beyond these limits Equestrian physics rapidly ceases to operate,  and while (unlike the larger types of Dragonids) Ponies can operate as functional biological beings outside of ‘Celestia’s Protection’,  their para-physical abilities become unusable…”
<p></p>“Equestrian rock-farming techniques had already proven their superiority to conventional mining techniques in most scenarios. During the war years,  working exhausting 24-hour shifts,  Earth Ponies produced more strategic minerals for the war effort than all of Latin America combined…”
<p></p>“While Equestria’s manufacturing capacity was limited at the outbreak of war,  its immediate contribution to US industry was not just raw materials. From very early on Equestria provided electricity to factories throughout the western US,  generators on Equestrian land or in US territories overlapping Equestrian tau-space being spun day and night by magic. Although such projects had been suggested as early as 1905 by Tesla,  fear of becoming dependent on non-human energy sources had previously…”
<p></p>“Since Equestrian tau-space projects a considerable distance out into the Pacific,  it effectively created an impenetrable barrier around which any Japanese attacks on the west coast (now seem to have been strategically implausible,  if feared at the time) would have to swing wide out into the Pacific to avoid,  while providing a safe corridor for US naval travel to Alaska. With airspace in the control of Pegasi and Dragons,  Great Blue Sea Serpents under the waters,  and the possibility of direct intervention by Celestia or Luna,  it is unsurprising that Yamamoto,  in a secret report to the government described any attempt to penetrate Equestrian waters as ‘suicide’.”
<p></p>“Relationships with Nazi Germany were poor from the start,  with Princess Celestia as early as 1933 describing Nazi ideology as “the essence of Discord”,  a fearsome insult in Pony culture. The Nazis,  on their part,  soon were to describe the Ponies as “unnatural animal monsters”,  not to mention their being under Jewish influence [1]…Some scholars of the Third Reich have suggested that given Nazi mysticism,  many Nazis were profoundly hurt that a virginal,  magical white unicorn had condemned their ‘philosophy’ as poison.”
<p></p>“It has long been scientifically established that some Ponies possess precognitive abilities. Although their abilities are somewhat clouded for events outside of Equestrian tau-space,  during the war “time-sensitives” were able to give advance warning of major new German or Japanese attacks on several dozen occasions,  by as much as twenty-four hours in some cases – unfortunately,  this had the side effect of convincing the Germans that their codes had been cracked,  leading to…”
<p></p>“Although it would not become truly important until the Space Age,  the fact that the Equestrian Tau-space “bubble” also extends 500 miles up proved to be of some benefit during the war. By establishing magically levitated platforms at a height of nearly 400 miles,  it was possible to put half the Pacific under direct visual surveillance…”
<p></p>“The relations between Equestria and Japan had been cordial before the war; both nations were modernizing non-western regimes,  both were subject to racism and paranoia from other states,  and both were ruled over by God-Kings/Queens. Of course,  the fact that the rulers of Equestria actually were nigh-immortal demigods made some Japanese rather uncomfortable…In the 1920s,  Japanese art and design became highly popular in Equestria,  and some Ponies braved the many inconveniences of travel outside their realm to make cultural pilgrimages to Japan…Equestria,  at least,  made no distinction between human races and creeds,  and if they did not allow much human immigration,  it was for understandable reasons. No Pony had ever used racist slurs against Japanese,  nor had anyone of Asian (or any other,  for that matter) descent been lynched by Ponies…in the end,  it was Equestria the Japanese Emperor asked to mediate a peace between the Empire and the US,  as the one nation he felt they could trust as an honest and disinterested broker.”
<p></p>“In spite of the loss of their para-physical abilities and their basically pacifist natures,  a surprising number of Ponies (mostly Earth and Unicorns: Pegasi found the loss of their flight abilities extremely traumatizing) left Equestria to serve in Allied armies. Although mostly confined to engineering,  scouting,  and pack-carrying duties,  Ponies would eventually be seen on front-lines…Ponies showed great courage under fire,  returning to pull injured soldiers from the battlefield and carrying ammunition…their unbreakable good cheer,  tremendous capacity for hard work and friendly nature made them mascots of whatever platoon they belonged to,  and the delivery of Equestrian-made baked goods to camp was always a source of celebration.”
<p></p>“Kindly as most of their species are,  some Ponies did serve as combat troops. The development in 1942 of a gun capable of being held and fired by a Pony’s surprisingly flexible and dexterous hooves,  a joint effort of Sparkly Steel Inc. and Springfield Rifle,  allowed Ponies to participate in combat as other than support troops…perhaps the war provided an outlet for those rare Pony misfits who find their society,  shall we say,  annoying…most Ponies are capable of standing upright for some time,  allowing them to use both hooves for…perhaps the most decorated combat Pony in WWII,  Clint Easthoof,  in spite of what the movies tell us,  in fact did not use a gun in winning his first medal: having dropped it while galloping to the machine gun nest,  he simply kicked the Germans to death.”
<p></p>“After the war,  Equestria became a place of pilgrimage for US and other Allied veterans suffering from PTSD,  Pony mind-magic being far more effective than the crude drugs and therapy available in the US at the time. It was not until the 1950s,  by which time <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McCarthy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McCarthy">Mc Carthy</a> and others had decided Equestria was not properly dedicated to the job of beating the Red Menace,  that allegations of Equestrian “brain-washing” began to emerge…”
<p></p>[1] Equestrian limitations on human immigrants were temporarily relaxed in the 30s to allow in Jewish refugees unable to make it into the US or other safe destinations.
