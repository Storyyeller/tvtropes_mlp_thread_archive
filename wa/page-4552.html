            So,  I missed the initial airing do to a game of Civilization I was playing,  but I watched it on Youtube so I'll skip the 40+ new pages of discussion and just say my thoughts now.
<p></p><ul><li> The beginning was awfully cringe worthy,  I had to start and stop the video several time to get through it.
</li><li> I think it is safe to say that Angel is nothing more then a spoiled brat of a rabbit.
</li><li> I thought we would see a lot more of Iron Will then we did and,  strangest of all,  he turned out to be pretty reasonable all things considered.
</li><li> I found the "Flutterbitch" routine to be a lot more entertaining here then it was in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoH" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoH">Ro H</a>. There is just something about the way she belittles Pinkie and Rarity that was just so. . . glorious.
</li><li> The resolution was actually pretty well handled.
</li><li> Did we just see the origin of the stare?
</li><li> Goats are apparently intelligent in this setting,  but they can't speak Equestrian language (except Iron Will can)?
</li><li> So Rarity and Pinkie are prone to manipulation and trickery when they don't get what they want and are confirmed as the most blatantly <strike>racist</strike> specieist of the group. Duly noted.
</li></ul><p></p>So yeah,  great episode. Officially my new favorite Fluttershy episode,  that's it.

            About the "Everypony is more of a jerk than they ususally are, " I have a theory.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">A bit before Iron Will offers one of his seminars,  the goats send out advertisements to various ponies containing hormones to make them act more like jerks than they normally are. This bolsters sales when he gets there,  though Iron Will himself is not aware of any of this. Everyone who was a jerk to Fluttershy got one of these letters,  and Rarity and Pinkie may have gotte them as well,  which explains how Rarity knew about Iron Will. Angel didn't get one though,  he was just being himself.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">

            Yeah,  they weren't exactly giving Fluttershy the right lessons,  either. It was nice to see the episode show us that aggressive bullying,  flirting,  and trickery are <em>not</em> the right ways to deal with people.

            You thought so,  Mio? I thought they only really did one bad thing apiece... aside from that they were just trying to help and support their friend,  and I thought they were being really nice.
<p></p>You know what I just realized? This episode felt different from some of the recent ones to me,  and I was trying to figure out why. I think I've got it now: It was a much smaller scale episode than some of the recent ones. Like,  it was really mellow. IT was just three friends being friends. No zany antics,  no adventure,  no wild shenanigans. Just ordinary friends dealing with ordinary friend stuff. I like that. I've missed it. I'm really not sure how much I like the expansion of the universe this season.

            @Kegisak: I know,  I've been waiting for an episode like that.
<p></p>And yeah,  outside of the market scene,  Rarity and Pinkie were more concerned with Fluttershy's well-being.  As for the "Monster" thing,  keep in mind that Iron Will is big,  aggressive,  looks like a bit of a jerk,  and is literally in the same "mythological monster" category as the hydra and the manticore.  All of Rarity and Pinkie's experience with him point to him willingly turning their friend into a bitch,  and it wouldn't be unlikely that his seminars have had this kind of result before.  I mean,  if a big,  aggressive guy in real life did the same stuff IW did,  he'd probably get a few people labelling him as "Monstrous" as well.
<p></p>Not to mention that in a world where literal monsters exist,  it might not have <em>that</em> many negative connotations anyway.

            @Kegisak: They weren't really,  but if that is how they typically deal with issues like getting things they want,  it doesn't exactly speak highly of them.
<p></p>I also agree that the smaller more intimate scale of events here was something that had been missing for a good part of the season.

            It might be along the same line as calling him Asian,  and Flutters qualified that he was Chinese. He could take offense to it if he chose,  but on the whole it's acceptable.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I suppose,  but considering that they did it in response to Fluttershy getting stepped all over,  they may have simply been a bit meaner than normal in defense of their friend. I'm generally a very genial person and don't willingly intimidate,  but if someone was being a jerk to one of my friends,  they and I might have words.

            True.  I still think the basic point is that they have a reason to referring to him as monster outside of just insulting him.  I mean,  all of their knowledge of the guy points to him being a dick and a bully.  We don't really find out that he isn't that bad until the end.  I mean,  before Fluttershy talked him down,  it was entirely possible that he was going to break into her house to retrieve his payment.
<p></p>Not to mention that even if it is negative,  it's also probably a lot milder than what we have in mind.  When Fluttershy refers to herself as a monster,  she could just have easily said "I'm a jackass" and it would have meant about the same thing.

            It can't really be an ethnic thing if Fluttershy uses it to refer to herself...   I'm pretty sure it refers more to his aggressive personality than anything else.

            So I just caught up after watching the episode.
<p></p>Reactions:
<ul><li> This provides more fuel to the Fluttershy likes bondage camp.
</li><li> So Bonbon speaks again. Is this a new voice,  or does it match any of the previous ones?
</li><li> Surely there is some lower denomination than 1 bit? Equestria's prices are really messed up.
</li><li> Why didn't Fluttershy just fly over the river?
</li><li> I was really hoping that the Duck Season bit would be subverted,  but oh well.
</li><li> Was the Tourist pony Rarity's father?
</li></ul><p></p><em>I wonder if that's why they had to hold the episode up a week... to swap out the mail pony :P</em>
<p></p>Actually they make these things months in advance.
<p></p><em>Did anyone notice NM's theme during the scene at Fluttershy's cottage near the end?</em>
<p></p>So that's what that was. I noticed the music but I didn't get the reference.
