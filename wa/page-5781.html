            @Lukrer: I'm trying to go into dev mode here,  but... having never played an RPG it's tricky. But here's the two things that leap out at me:
<p></p>Once,  I'm still a bit confused on the Cutie mark issue. Is it a matter of picking and choosing which skills you want,  or do cutie marks have a 'class'? What I mean is,  could I,  in theory,  have a cutie mark with Constitution as my major,  then Wisdom and Charisma as minors? Or do you have established classes like "Athlete",  which gives you Strength,  Constitution and Dexterity,  but you can choose which to major and minor in?
<p></p>Secondly,  I'm not sure about the balance of EP's there. They're appealing off the start,  but they still don't have any racials and a head start won't be worth all that much in later levels. It's sort of an issue of diminishing returns - they're good at the start,  but in higher levels they're bad for having no real 'unique' traits. A pool of EP talents,  or even just a passive benefit that persists through their entire growth. Like,  I don't know,  more stat points per each level? A 'prestige' that gives them an easier time learning skills in a specific set(So,  say I pick wisdom as my prestige - I then have a consistently easier time learning wisdom skills)? I realize the latter has the troubling issue of 'stacking' prestiges with you Cutie mark,  or being redundant,  but as it stands I think their balance is just off.
<p></p>There are a couple things that I'm not sure of as well,  but they don't leap out as much. I'm not entirely certain of assigning skills to specific stats,  if it is the way you mean. Is it like,  say,  'Haymaker' is a dexterity skill,  so I need a dexterity of 10 to learn it? There's also the issue of armours and weapons,  but we can regard them as irrelevant since this is just the basic stat system. here. I only vaguely understand the combat system in most RPG's,  so I may need a refresher on that,  as well...

            @Kegi:  I don't know about other systems,  or the one that Perpetual is making,  but in Pathfinder and 3.5,  when a skill is a Dexterity skill,  that means when you use that skill you roll a D20,  then add however many points you've put into that skill,  plus your Dex bonus.

            Okay... so skills will have individual requirements,  but they'll each have a single stat as a modifier? That makes sense.

            Since Perception is a Wisdom based skill,  that means you have better eyesight and hearing the older you get.

            @Kegi Don't feel bad for picking at it. This is all needed if we want to do something remotely quality. With the Cutie Marks,  you get to choose what to major and minor in,  no classes involved. Balance will always be an issue,  but Earth Ponies should definitely have powerful exclusive skills. It's just that those skills aren't something that Earth Ponies have by default,  but are things they have to work toward(super strength,  plant growing abilities,  etc). As for aligning the Skills with attributes,  that is to facilitate the Cutie Mark compatibility. It also indicates what attributes apply bonuses/penalties to rolls for the skill.
