            I predict that in Season 3,  it'll be revealed that Apple Bloom is adopted. Why? Well,  consider this:
<p></p><ol><li> "The Cutie Mark Chronicles" shows that Applejack's parents were absent,  even when she was a filly. Apple Bloom was not shown in the flashback. Indeed,  the very first episode showed pretty much Applejack's entire family...and I wonder if her parents were even in that crowd!
</li><li> Applejack's family has Cutie Marks related to apples...for the most part. However,  Apple Bloom's special talent is strongly implied to have <em>nothing</em> to do with apples,  and the Cutie Mark will have to reflect that.
</li></ol><p></p>I'm sure Apple Bloom will probably be shocked when she finds that out! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_evilgrin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="evil grin" title="evil grin">

            When I went hiking at Gunpowder State Park in MD,  I was surprised that we bascially pulled off on the side of a highway and there was this amazing forest and series of waterfalls.
<p></p>There is also this place on the border of DC called Great Falls,  that is this waterfall and river that has carved its way through granite to make some fairly impressive cliffs.  I think I might go hike the Billy Goat trail there next weekend.  They call it that because you have to do some light rock climbing,  or scrambling as they call it.
<p></p>It makes me a little sad when Im hiking and I see trash that people left behind though

            Yeah that rant was idiotic. And yeah he makes a point about the people that take it to far,  but when  that's ALL you talk about it makes it seem like they represent the average/majority,  not a very small minority. And kinda stupid to say something is biased or pandering before you even see it.  Oh well.

            @Tigger. Nothing says that the Apples had to be there when AJ went to Manehattan. The idea I've seen is that they wandered around Equestria helping the other Apple family farms for most of their lives. They could have been wandering around,  came back to the farm for Apple Bloom's birth,  then left later on after she grew a bit. Soon after,  they might have died. <span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> I personally don't believe this theory,  but it makes sense</div></span> Braeburn wasn't at the reunion either,  remember. <br> <br>Granny's Smith's cutie mark is a pie. While it can be connected to apples,  it's really out there. Cutie marks don't have to be obvious,  they can be extract. See: Cheerilee. Apple Bloom's could end up being an apple blossom,  but represent the creativity of design she has as she builds/designs/creates things for Sweet Apple Acres or something. <br> <br>If the topic is on something I don't feel like talking about,  I just ignore it and do something else for a while.<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> Like most of the conversation the last hour or so.

            The furries had a similar problem when people were focusing on the "Yiffy" part of it instead of the fandom as a whole.  It doesnt help that the "Yiffy" side tended to be a VERY vocal minority.
<p></p>In latter years it seems like they have become the majority though,  the fandom used to downplay that stuff now they openly embrace it.

<p></p>To be a citizen of Canada you don't have to renounce your right of citizenship to your birth country.  I have dual citizenship and I wasn't born in Canada.
<p></p>What is more likely is the country of birth doesn't recognize dual citizenship so you have to renounce your citizenship to the birth country in order to become a Canadian citizen.

Yeah,  I think I can agree with that. If only because seeing their parents would make for some interesting interactions. Rarity's were hilarious,  for example. I was just saying that a lot of people think AJ's could be dead. <br> <br>I really want to see Pinkie's family again.

            @Swasfews   Rarity parent were probably dead too in popular fanon.  I saw that cliche in Past Sins.  And it was ridiculous because I saw Sisterhoof episode before reading that. It was Narmy,   like Rarity  was just overdramatic when saying that she is only pony left to take care  for Sweetie.
<p></p>Hmm  when to think about it even  AJ dead parents thign in  Dangerous Business was little narmy too.
<p></p>At least no fan blame Firecracker for dead parents :P

            @Seraphem Did you even watch the whole thing? His main problem is that most of these kinds of documenaries always end up being positively-biased circle-jerks,  and if this one weren't being headed by John De Lancie,  I'd be inclined to agree. He also stated that he had no problems with bronies as a whole (and even said that he collected Chinese girl's dolls as a hobby). It's the self-defensive "all criticism is wrong and stupid" stance that so much of the fandom takes that he is speaking out against,  and that's what you're demonstrating right now.
