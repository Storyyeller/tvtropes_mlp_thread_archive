<p></p>I admit it may have made for an amusing plot line,  say a point where they decide to switch elements and they don't work,  showing some more palpable reasons they represent their original ones.

I don't see it. Dash's nervous breakdown was because she was utterly terrified of opening up and revealing her weakness to the crowd. Even after her character development,  she opens up to Scootaloo to admit that she used to be scared of campfire storiesâ€”but she also insists that Scootaloo not tell anyone else about that.

            Loyalty and honesty are both traits that get messed up because we overthink them,  but for different reasons.  I like the idea that when the Elements were sorting out the Manes,  it came down to Loyalty and Honesty,  and Loyalty wound up picking Dash because while she's hotheaded enough to undermine a lot of her better traits,  it makes her so bullheaded that <em>not</em> being loyal doesn't even enter her mind.  Honesty picked Applejack because she knows how to deliver it in a way people are more likely to accept instead of throwing it in their face.
<p></p>The main problem is that there hasn't really been much that's pushed that aspect of their character to its limit.

            I dunno,  for some reason the two actually seem more fleshed out with the other's elements as their key driving force.
<p></p>I could see a few amusing scenarios being made from their current elements though,  eg. AJ learning to make 'little white lies' (and likely going overboard due to having little premise on it) due to a moment of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">Brutal Honesty</a> hurting someone she's devoted to,  and RD,  well she's superhero material,  there's many scenarios they could make out of her altruism to someone else (and likely fantasizing too much in the whole heroism ideal).

            @Psi: I agree that RD and AJ <em>qualified</em> for each other's element,  but that doesn't mean that they don't <em>also</em> qualify for their own.
<p></p>In the mechanics of the RPG I made anbout the show,  everypony has a numerical rating in each of the six virtues. AJ and RD have high scores in both virtues which is hardly unusual.

            This morning,  my dream had a bizarre mix of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicTheGathering" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a> competition (even though I haven't played seriously since Mirrodin-Kamigawa!),  some strange nice old dude who turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus">Santa Claus</a> and gave me some nice Old Power cards,  and I <em>swear</em> Luna made a cameo appearance on the moon that appeared in the dreamscape's night sky.
<p></p>Finally,  she shows up after many,  many dreams. Previously it was just random Pinkie cameos and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Yukari Yakumo (or her umberella!)</a> showing up in the background.

            The sixth element cheated by being ability based rather than personality based. Magic is what Twilight is studying in devotedly and clearly surpasses all of the other six in (largely because all but one doesn't even have that ability). There is of course the 'friendship is magic' connection however,  which Twilight was originally the least devoted to,  but then learned excessively by that point (abiding by moments such as Lesson Zero,  to almost <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> degrees at times).

            @Red: I agree that the pilot didnt exactly demonstrate <em>real</em> honesty and loyalty,  but I <em>do</em> think RD <em>is</em> loyal and AJ <em>is</em> honest.
<p></p>EDIT: I think that the bearer of the sixth element has to demonstrate both magic <em>and</em> friendship. They need a bond with each of the other bearers as well.

They all have basic good qualities and standards that interchange with each other,  but the other's have shown to excell in ways it wouldn't with a different character.

            @Psi: I mostly agree. I <em>do</em> think tat AJ's honesty is significant though due to how foreign deceit is to her though. And I think that RD is more loyal than average though. That said,  I am of the veiw that most ponies qualify for <em>at least one</em> element of harmony.

Meanwhile RD's moments are driven more by her 'id' and her bare bones viewpoint leading her not to know when to keep her mouth shut (she dug herself into a hole by being so upfront about how awesome she thought she was,  or how much she thought reading sucked).
