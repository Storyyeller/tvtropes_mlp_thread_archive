<p></p>For some reason when I think of AJ,  I actually think a more badass variant of this guy:
<p></p><center><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="425" height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mluYB9YfzSI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p></p>I think it's a good example of a 'rough around the edges' type character that has a kind of down to earth and tame demeanor,  but still gets a lot of humor and vibrancy out of it.
<p></p>His frustrated clash with the first gluttonous monster in particular ("Don't even THINK about it!!") seemed very AJ-ish in particular.

            I think it varies,  I admit a comical characters needs some extent of poignant moments to gain pathos,  though I still find slightly exaggerative whimsical ones more likeable. I get a much clearer view of how their personality works.

            Well heres the complete opossite. I LOVE Baby Cakes precisely for how light-hearted and nice it was the episode. It makes me feel so happy and I´m not even a fan of Pinkie that episode is just gorgeous on how nice it was.

            Good character development is what matters to me, doesn't matter if it's comic or tragic. Most of the episodes are A or B episodes for this reason, which is why an episode I find to be average depresses me.
<p></p>And a lot of those episodes would be A episodes if one little thing wasn't added (Sonic Rainboom was marred by the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism">Acquired Situational Narcissism</a> and Ponyville Confidential was hit hard by literally <em>everypony but Twilight, Rarity, and the CMC's</em> not getting the Aesop and being hypocrites.

            I think subtlety works,  but I still like the characters being whimsical about it for the large part. As said I think Twilight works better in both flawed and Straight Man roles despite similarly being one of the more lucid ponies,  largely because her flaws often seep through in everything she does,  whether it be over the top or very subtle gags. Her very brief role in this episode is a good example (...."Uh huh"....). She is whimsical but still capable of subtlety. There are only a few odd episodes her personality 'turns off',  usually early ones and even then it's not that consistant.

            Pretty much like school grades ya' know A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F. Most MLP episodes fit somewhere between A and B-, only 6 have earned the A+ and not that many have been boring or generic or off-putting enough to just be average (C+-C-) or below average (D+-F).
<p></p>I know most tropers prefer 1-10 scale but I think that's a little too specific, and I know troper Sereg uses tiers, but that doesn't really get the point across like an A or B.

            I use tiers as well,  mainly because trying to quantify something as subjective as the quality of an episode into a number or grade implies more precision than I can actually come up with.  Like using a number scale implies that there's some sort of objective difference in quality between say,  a 9 and an 8,  when often it comes down to "I liked this episode more".

            Speaking of episode ratings,  since this is the mid-season break,  should we start throwing up our current rankings of the episodes for the season or should that wait till later when we start running out of things to talk about?

            I think that's what really burns about this episode, ..if it was last week and the Family Reunion was this week, it wouldn't have been so bad. But now with such a meh! episode, that's the note MLP ends on for three weeks.
<p></p>I just hope Polsky can deliver next week with "Keep Calm and Flutter On"
<p></p>But very well from 9-1

            The third season started on a low (Crystal Empire was meh,  while TMPP and OBS were fine,  but nothing special) then slowly rose up for me (Magic Duel was a pretty good episode,  followed by two great Character Developing episodes for RD),  then started to jolt a bit back down (disappointed by the two AJ episodes,  though SAYS was fairly enjoyable).

            I though the premier was pretty damn good. one of the best episodes,  just,  not as good as the last two two parters,  though above the pilot.

<p></p>....
<p></p>Called it!
<p></p>Kinda sad it won with 2118 votes,  thats...well a really low number.
<p></p>Oh and Crystal Empire was the best episode for me this season. Why? It had an awesome villain! Oh and a good story too. Still unless they pull another Baby Cakes I´m gonna stick with that as my favourite.Magic Duel came close buuuut I didn´t quite like it that much. SO yeah Crsytal Empire for me.

            I'd definitely put Spike at Your Service over Apple Family Reunion.  AFR is probably one of my least favorite episodes of the season.  It's not bad,  but there's just nothing particularly memorable about it either. It's just kinda <em>there</em>.
