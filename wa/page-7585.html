When you're part of a group,  being The Generic Hero just makes you seem bland. And Thor's just Generic Hero + Ham. At least Black Widow and Hawkeye had a chance to stand out at the beginning.

Back when I was forced to take those elementary school typing courses,  the program was very exact about what it wanted and would only acknowledge three spaces.  Tab just registered as an error. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_evilgrin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="evil grin" title="evil grin">  And then it stuck for a very long time.
