            Everything that Trixie does can be attributed to lights and sounds. He cutie mark even has a wand on it - a commonly cited symbol of trickery when it comes to magic,  or a booster. Not true magic,  like Twilight's. Trixie's special talent is <em>performance</em>,  and hence her magic revolves around illusions - lights and sounds. She's trained her telekenisis to be extremely fine (probably much finer than Rarity's),  then she casts images and sounds over top of them to make them seem more real. How else do you ezplain her turning a rainbow into a tornado?
<p></p>Then again,  it's all conjecture. I like the idea,  but there's no real proof for it.
<p></p>My favourite thing about this show is that all of its 'antagonists' can be construed sympathetically. Gilda is a jerk? Her best friend is drifting away from her. Yeah she was mean to begin with,  but she felt like the ponies ganged up on her and then her best friend turned her back on her,  over what could really just be seen as a bad day.
<p></p>Trixie was a braggart,  but she still tired to help when it was needed,  and had a pretty clear inferiority complex.
<p></p>Blueblood was boorsih and rude,  but Rarity was being a gold digger,  and at the end of the day Blueblood wasn't doing anything out of character for his class.
<p></p>Their all jerks,  but they aren't <em>just</em> jerks. There's always that little kernel of goodness,  or at least decency,  if you're willing to look for it. I like that.

If you only show up to complain about what we're talking about,  I have to wonder why you bother at all.

            @Ginger,  ... You describe that as though you're trying to induce pathos,  like we will make our own sympathy despite it all.
<p></p>@Kegisak,  Blueblood's ask tumblr has obliterated any sympathy I may have for him,  though Rarity <em>was</em> being a gold digger. I can understand your perspective for Trixie and Gilda.
<p></p>I just need to find a  way to care more for them I suppose.

            @Mousa No. The first thing I wanted to do was make perfectly clear that these guys are getting exactly what's coming to them.
<p></p>... that said. The point of my film is supposed to be "Bad people can still do good things" I have faith in humanity,  and I think even the worst among us can still be genuinely kind. These guys are dying,  but they have the chance to spare dozens of others from their fate

            You almost never use semi-colons.
<p></p>And I doubt that's true,  this sort of thing is usually a time issue. I wrote seven very long chapters of a novel over the course of five years and I did it mostly when I had no friends to hang with. When I did I was working on it less an less.

            We actually tend to give really good criticism on the fanfiction thread in new media,  Ginger. But for the issue of actually finishing something you just need to sit yourself down and force yourself to do it. I used to be unable to follow through,  but the most important thing my school did for me is give me that ability to finish something. Give yourself either a time where you <em>will</em> sit down and work,  or set yourself a time limit and stick to it. It helps a lot.
<p></p>And Mousa,  the story still has three more chapter to go. I'm looking at a wordcount upwards of 120, 000 words (three times the minimum length of a novel) when it's done. It's taken me just over three months so far - I manage it by sitting down and forcing myself to write for three hours each night. By this point I've just gotten so used to it that I legitimately don't know what I'll do when I'm finished it.

            Re: Twilight
<p></p>Forget what Celestia said about Twilight's raw talent. You know why she didn't have friends before being dragged (yes,  <em>dragged</em>) to Ponyville? She spent all day with nothing but books and magic. No parties,  no socializing,  no nothing,  ever since she was a filly who picked up a dusty old tome. Before the entrance exam,  she didn't even have Spike as a companion.
<p></p>Forget talent,  Twilight doesn't even need it. With all that study time put in,  she can't <em>not</em> be good at magic.

            @Kegisak: Man,  I wish I had three hours a night to spend on my writing.  I usually get an hour at best.
<p></p>@ginger: Once you get over that initial hump,  it gets a little easier to write.  And everybody's first writing is always crap.  Some of the best advice about writing I've ever gotten is "assume that your first draft is going to suck".  You're never going to get Shakespeare quality stuff right off the bat.  That and the only way to get better at writing is to write.  Yeah,  the first few stories might not be all that great; but you'll learn how to make subsequent works better.
<p></p>Also,  the reasons one bad decision tends to stick more than one good decision is that the bad decision tends to have way worse consequences than a good decision,  and that a act of good is way easier to fake than a bad one.  A bad person will do a good thing to try to trick people; a good person obviously won't do the opposite.

            How much of your first draft do you usually keep? I'm tempted to just chuck what I have written so far and start again. That seems to always happen to any of my writing,  be it personal statements or fiction.

            Now is that that it's <em>good</em>,  or that it's <em>popular</em>? Because <em>Feedback</em>,  my first fic,  remains my most popular by far. But it's still easily the worst of what I've written - it lacks polish,  the lead is dull and the pacing is a bit sloppy. Everything I've done since then has gotten better and better (Even my most recent chapter of <em>The Colour you Bleed</em> is probably leagues above the first),  even if it hasn't ever been as popular as the first one.

MY style tends to be flamboyant (thought not to purple levels),  and I try to keep a good sense of rhythm,  so I'll stumble over myself a lot and need to correct the flow.
