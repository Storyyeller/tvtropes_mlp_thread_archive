            Their magic negates the fact that their bodies are too dense for flight,  but the wings are still necessary for propulsion,  direction,  generating lift,  and stabilization in flight,  and for that,  you need either feathers like a bird or a membrane like a bat.

            @Ginger: It almost seems like that fic always puts you in a bad mood,  because I keep seeing you complain about it. Why do you read that fanfic if it really pisses you off this much?
