            I don't want ANY of the blame to rest with an external force. It's Luna's fault,  she deserved her time and,  actually,  I don't think the elements purged her mind,  I think it showed her all the times that Celestia prayed for her,  and all the ponies who camped under the stars and celebrated the night. They showed her what she'd always wanted. All of it real. It also showed her all the misery she caused.

            Why can't some of the blame rest on an outside force?  You know,  you'd probably be a lot happier if you didn't get so set on stories playing out in whatever specific way you want them to.

            @Ginger You see,  this is the fun part about headcanon. You can think what you want to think,  and other people can think what they want to think. There is so little evidence to support or disprove either theory that neither side is wrong.
<p></p>Personally,  I think that Luna became Nightmare Moon by tapping into some dark power,  yes,  but she most likely sought out that power herself to overthrow her sister with no outside prompting other than her own envy. Once consumed by the darkness she felt no remorse for her actions,  only realizing what she had done after being purified by the Elements.

            I guess I just don't want the elements to purify her. As I said,  I think they just gave her some well needed <em>PERSPECTIVE</em>. Showing her that ponies DO care about her nights,  her sister DOES truly love her,  and that she's making others miserable by being NM.

            @Mio:  Well they were just fillies after all.  Unlike a lot of people I don't think the town's treatment of them was over the top (except for Twilight) but once they apologized it makes sense that the town would forgive them.

            @Ginger By "purified" I don't mean "remove the evil from them". I'm sure Luna still carries that resentment with her to this day. Just look at how she reacted to the townspeople's fear of her in Luna Eclipsed.

"It is of no use,  Twilight Sparkle. They have never liked us,  and they never shall."
</div>
<p></p>I just mean that whatever power she tapped into removed her ability to feel remorse. When the Elements removed that,  she realized all of the horrible things she had done and begged her sister for forgiveness. She didn't try to make any excuses.

            You do know that Pinkie is a mane cast member,  so her constant appearances in fanon are more justified than a one shot character who wasn't nearly as powerful as she claimed to be.
