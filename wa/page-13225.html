            No,  Discord's being sentient the entire time is kinda horrifying,  but wasn't that the case before,  too? I just mean,  actually,  it's old news.

            Repost from last page,  since I don't think anyone noticed it:
<p></p>Really weird fact: Teddy Antonio,  who was given the story credit for this episode,  <a class="urllink" href="http://intensedebate.com/people/TeddyAntonio/2">was 15 when he wrote and submitted the story for this episode to the writers.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> I'm sure he must have had some connections to get his story looked at and used in the first place,  but it's kinda cool that he essentially submitted a fanfic and got it turned into an actual episode script,  and then got credited and paid as a writer for it.

            I can get all that. My main problem is that the episode was boring. So I guess I´m a little butthurt after two months of hearing "Applejack is boring" and this happened. I get that people would find this episode funny,  I didn´t. At all. I enjoyed the two previous episodes a lot more than this.

            <strong>Perpetual</strong>,  I noticed,  I just couldn't think of anything I thought was very interesting to say. But that is neat,  it gives hope to those who are interested in pitching a script for animation. I once read a very interesting book about that,  Jeffrey Scott's <em>How to Write for Animation</em>,  but it's not something I'd really consider doing at the moment.

            The episode bored <em>you</em>. Most of us here,  at least,  seemed to enjoy it.
<p></p>This is especially important when expressing a negative opinion,  but it's best not to phrase an opinion as though it were objective fact (accidentally or otherwise).

The premise was <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/MMeghanMcCarthy/status/290607982251753472">submitted<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on September 28,  2011,  and that's only four days after "The Return of Harmony Part 2" premiered.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Wait,  if Episode 8 appears out of order,  that would make this episode 10,  wouldn't it? so there are three episodes left?</div>
This is just episode 10 by broadcast order (and possibly iTunes Store order); the official sources generally keep the numbering intact from production order regardless of airdates. But yeah,  this season has three episodes left to be aired.

            @Ales: What Kyler said.  "This episode was boring" and "this episode bored me" come across very differently.

            So I was interrupted during the stream but luckily people put stuff on youtube fast.
<p></p>I liked this episode,  the ending was short and rushed but  have to say,  well played,  an I was basically laughing at Discord's antics all the way through.
<p></p>I almost thought they would tone down his reality defying madness but nope,  they just threw in more!
<p></p>Nice to see he was reformed but it was a 100% switch,  he's still going to be a bit of a chaotic jerk but he'll try to be helpful. I can live with this. Heck,  this was what I wanted since he was introduced and have him be a recurring nuisance throughout the series.

            I think this is a case of a character completely trumping the plot.  A lot of people love the episode because of whatever Discord did first and foremost.  Any toning down on his powers,  or getting a replacement voice actor,  would've made this episode very bad.

            Umh I think I made clear that it was I who hated it. Maybe my poor english didn´t transmited that.
<p></p>I liked the previous Discord episodes better,  even if they were just a rehearsal of the first two of the show. Its true I dont like Discord very much but I also hated Fluttershy all over this episode.
<p></p>Also I´m sticking to Linkara statement that "This X sucks!" its an opinion not a fact. So its a valid argument to use.
<p></p>Bottom line,  I knew this episode was gonna suck to me and it totally did.
