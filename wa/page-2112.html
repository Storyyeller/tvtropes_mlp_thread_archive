            @Ginger: I tend to assume that societies shouldn't desert their fundamental ideals in the interest of risk avoidance until lives are obviously at risk. Spikezilla is <em>not</em> this situation; he captured the Wonderbolts rather than attempt to barbecue them,  and even his abduction of Rarity inflicted no worse harm on her than a ripped cloak.

<p></p>Hi,  crow. Long time,  no see. I know Ponyville is just gonna forgive him. I'm just suggesting what I'd do If I were there.

            I'm sure there was plenty of offscreen apologies and explanations.  And like I said,  being part of the group that saves Ponyville on a regular basis probably goes a long way.
<p></p>Alternatively,  they could just not tell anyone.  Rarity didn't recognize him after all.

<p></p>This is a town that chooses to live right next to the Everfree Forest.  On the list of dangers which they casually ignore,  letting Spike stay in town is pretty far down.

            The Everfree forest is a part of the geography. The can't very well exile the FOREST can they. Spike is a potentially massive threat on par with anything we've seen from the forest. This time,  it's a problem that can EFFORTLESSLY be solved.
<p></p>again,  I'm the only one who sees the risk,  clearly
<p></p>Say you lived in the jungle. Any day you could be attacked by a massive animal and be killed. Would you willingly live with a guy who has a medical condition that gives him a 10% chance of going batshit insane while you sleep?

            @Ginger: The thing is that you automatically jumped the to the most extreme measures available without considering less extreme measures first.  Typical problem solving technique is basically,  start with the solutions that are most beneficial to <em>everyone</em>,  Spike included. If we can't find a plan that protects the town while Spike lives in it,  <em>then</em> we consider exile as a viable option.
<p></p>Also,  Spike's growth process <em>doesn't work like that</em>.  He doesn't just suddenly turn into Godzilla in five minutes at a random time; he has to start acting excessively greedy,  and even then it takes like a day before he goes into rage mode.  Here's how my priority of planning for dealing with it would work:
<p></p>1. Preventing Spike's transformations by noting that he's being greedy and having him knock it off.
<p></p>2. If that isn't a viable solution,  try recognize the warning signs (such as him getting tall),  and get him out of town before he's dangerous
<p></p>3. If <em>that</em> isn't a viable solution,  <em>then</em> we start considering making him live outside of town.
<p></p>But we don't go straight to "boot him!"  right at the beginning.

            I meant that they chose to live there in the first place.  And anyway,  its only a threat if there's a chance of it happening again,  which there really isn't.  Spike learned his lesson,  and everyone knows what to look out for.  They'll probably be pissed at him for awhile,  maybe overly cautious,  but this town seems to get over things remarkably fast.

            @JT Don't get me wrong. I'd WANT Spike to stay. but I always thought it was more practical to settle on the most extreme course of action (with the highest chance of succeeding) first,  then look backwards for something more sensible. I wouldn't put the exile into action until I was sure there was no other way. If you go with simpler stuff for the hell of it and it doesn't work then you're only wasting time,  rescources,  and putting people's lives in danger.
<p></p>Would you say this is not sensible?

            Honestly,  I can see where ginger's coming from. After all,  we are kinda biased by the fact that we know and love Spike. I don't know what exactly I would do if I were in the position of an average townsperson but Ponyville does have a habit of devolving into mob mentality (especially where the Flower Trio are concerned). If they started railing for exile,  I don't know if I'd trust myself not to join in.
<p></p>But it's a moot point either way. If Twilight or the Mayor wouldn't be able to stop it,  Celestia certainly would.
