            @Mio It was partly a morale boosting move I'm sure. Celestia had vacated the throne,  leaving Luna in charge of everything in the middle of the war. She wanted people around whom she could trust,  and wanted a way to boost the country's spirit. Cue her wheeling out the bearers of harmony <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

<p></p>As did I,  but on a much lower level. You see,  multiple areas look <em>exactly the same</em>. If any of you recall the AVGN Nintendo Power retrospective (that is,  if you watch him at all),  he remarks that the game "made you feel like a rat in a maze". No kidding! Plus,  there are WAY too many cheap shots when you go through the doorways,  to the point where you're bound to get hit by a wandering enemy either behind you or right in front of said door. Why? Because you're <em>still vulnerable</em> during that transition. It's just unfair :/

            Hey Mousa nice couple of comics.  Don't worry about not being too good at scary,  even Dr. Who sometimes has trouble.  It isone of those things that you can work at.  Me,  I mainly pull from Gothic literature and the stories of M.R. James and William Hope Hodgson to create an atmosphere of dread.  And once you create that atmosphere,  pull at the things that generally terrify people at their core.  Otherness,  the dark,  and death are always good ways to find inspiration.  If that fails,  draw from your own fears.

            You will all have to pardon me. One of the biggest reasons that I refuse to read FO:E is that   I just can't bring myself to believe the events of its backstory,  especially in the context of the show (which is something I probably should not be doing,  but oh well)

            @ Light: I don't watch him,  sorry. I kinda thought the point was feeling like a rat in a maze,  random exploration until you find out what works. Which I guess I invalidated by using a map. And yeah it's cheap being hit during a transition.

            it really gives a lot of info that makes it kinda make sense. We never learn just HOW the war started so can't tell what happened,  but it show that ponies just were not ready for war,  they,  as a culture,  just couldn't handle that kind of long term conflict and were slowy losing themselves.
