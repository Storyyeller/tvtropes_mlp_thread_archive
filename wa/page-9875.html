            <span class="blue">Watching Suite and Elite and I have to say Fleur still confuses me.  I really want to know what the show makers were thinking putting her in there,  she doesn't really seem to fit into any simple role I would expect.  With her one line and her action of actually helping Rarity pick up her bags,  she seems fairly nice,  so she's not another example of asshole rich people.  She was draping herself all over Fancypants like she was his girlfriend or something,  yet she didn't seem the slightest bit concerned when he started hitting on Rarity and inviting her out.

            Fancypants was hitting on Rarity? He just thought that she was a pony of class and taste (with royal connections,  at that) and invited her to attend a sporting event,  as far as I could tell.

            How the hell does that count as hitting on Rarity?
<p></p>I also think it's quite clear that she's a trophy wife,  but the over the top way she played it,  and the fact that Fancypants is too aware to really have a trophy wife,  suggests to me that there's much more to her than meets the eye.

            I'm sure she <em>loves</em> all of the attention,  and Fancypants clearly didn't mind her showing off. I wouldn't go so far as to call her a trophy wife,  though,  as that implies that Fancypants only keeps her around for her looks,  which we really have no evidence to support and he doesn't seem like the type to be so shallow.

<p></p><span class="blue">Anyway,  I spotted Fleur again later,  standing next to Fancypants in the background during Rarity's song... so I guess he didn't set her aside?</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">This episode is good but it would have been a lot better if they didn't repeatedly undermine their own premise.  It's based on the idea that "Rarity want's to be part of the elite upper society,  and that's okay" but every single pony she meets that isn't Fancypants or Fleur is completely irritating,  mindless,  and shallow.  Why would anyone <em>want</em> to hang out with them?  Plus it's utterly bizzare how a single compliment from Fancypants makes Rarity suddenly the most important pony in Canterlot.  Even Photo Finish was following her lead at the museum,  and she was already a famous and respected pony.</span>

            @Blue Fanycpants alone didn't get her in with all of those ponies. Rarity impresses them on her own at the derby. They were quite dismissive of her initially,  IIRC. Then the song more or less compressed several days of mingling and climbing the ladder into a few minutes.
