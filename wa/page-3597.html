            On the one hand,  I am predisposed in all manners to think slavery=wrong no matter what,  because if we have a right to freedom then so does anyone else that can think of anything remotely close to our level.
<p></p>On the other,  the whole reason that Dom/sub relationships are a thing is because the urge to submit,  even the suspension of someone’s rights willingly,  is because there are mentalities that prefer that kind of security and lack autonomy. The thing about rights is that people also have the right to give them up if they chose,  so long as it's something someone wants.
<p></p>Forcing a suspension of rights is wrong beyond a shadow of doubt....but so long as all participants are willing and no one is being forced,  I don't see an issue.

<p></p>Although I do admit the discussion of whether utilizing the services of a species with a natural desire to serve would be considered exploitation is quite interesting.  If they are truly naturally subservient and submit entirely out of choice,  I'm not sure that there'd actually be a problem.

The Cirbozoids are either genetically bred or genetically predisposed (I forget which) to servitude,  and it actually makes them uncomfortable to be considered as equals.  It's rather disconcerting to both the human crew of the <em>Paradigm</em> and to the reader.

            Ah,  Red,  so you're a Starslip fan as well?  Neat!  Admittedly,  I've fallen woefully behind,  but I did enjoy the comic since it did engage in some world building and had some elements of tragedy below the general silliness.
