<p></p>Nooo,  why have you abandoned us? Now only Perpetual Lurker is left. Well,  I guess changing your avatar is justifiable if it's a pony avatar. Just don't go changing it again.
<p></p>Also,  I watched the Super Best Friends clip. Superman looks like a Powerpuff Girls character.

In other words,  you shouldn‚Äôt look a gift horse in the mouth."</div>
I always thought that part of the lesson was more that if you try to listen to what everybody says,  it doesn't end well and nobody gets satisfied. <br> <br><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_down.png" alt="[down]" title="[down]" height="16" width="16">When I first started watching the series,  I remember seeing a lot of Rarity dislike.

            I liked Rarity since first episdoe.  She always was last from Mane 6 but there wasn't any hate toward her.

            Ah here's the comment; the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">Rescued from the Scrappy Heap</a> comment:
<p></p>"Many people admit to hating Rarity early into the show,  since she comes off as dim,  shallow,  arrogant and useless - in other words,  typical Rich Bitch,  the very stereotype she is designed to subvert. It's not until a bunch of episodes,  starting with "Suited for Success",  came out,  giving her a lot of screen time,  massive Character Development,  and actually living up to her element more often that they started warming up to her."
<p></p>It's odd as I actually thought Rarity had more Jerk moments later on,  if balanced by lots of altrustic ones,  similar to RD really. All in all however I don't think there was ever a point I thought she sucked,  she's one of those 'not my fave but likeable' types to me.

            YMMV need to be improved.  It list any character who have some small number of hater as Base Braker or Scrappy,  while  Ensemble Darkpony have more strict criteria.
<p></p>Not to mention that page still ignore target audience.

            I could have <em>sworn</em> that I saw (and still see) plenty of "Rarity is worst pony" comments.  One clueless brony actually said "all she cares about is shopping and makeovers" or something like that.
<p></p>...what.  Look,  I can get not <em>liking</em> a character.  But that wasn't anywhere near <em>accurate</em>.

            It's fully a taste thing I guess,  so I'm not going to try and convince you,  but you also have to look at it differently. The dresses were being designed for the Grand Galloping Gala.

            I can sometimes see that ethic with her,  but it's balanced with it being "all she cares about is shopping and makeovers <em>with her friends</em>". The show actually seems to be very careful with <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moments with her. I think with the wrong direction,  Ponyville Confidential could have easily made her a Scrappy,  instead a lot of fans insist she was the only pony they could stand in that episode.
<p></p>I actually like how they balance her materialism,  as in she's not overcharitable <em>or</em> too selfish and greedy. She's just kind of materialistic. This is an odd complexity but it can be seen as realistic in cases (ever had that one rich friend/relative you struggle to get a good Xmas gift for?).
