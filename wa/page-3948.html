            @ Allik,  really have to disgree with some of that,  4chan is not the Jerusalem of Mecca of Brony-dom,  it is not some place revered for it significance. Yes it is where brony-dom originated,  but not where it really flourished and had it's high point. it's our Nile River Valley,  our Tigress and Euphrates valley,  sure but not any place anypony reveres.

<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Agreed.  Just because the moment got its start on 4chan doesn't mean that the entire fanbase is going to evaporate.  They just got the ball rolling.  I'm guessing that there are a <em>lot</em> of bronies who don't frequent 4chan,  and that most those that do aren't going to ruin the fandom over this.  If any site is the hub of the brony movement its probably EQD; if <em>they</em> get shut down there could be problems,  but really I don't see this 4chan thing as that big of a deal.

            Unicorn. In addition to magic being awesome,  I'd like to be able to finely manipulate things without having to resort to my mouth XD
<p></p>And Ginger,  one of the soon-to-be main characters is an earth pony. You'll like him,  I think.

            some people like the suspense and surprised,  but since you don't
<p></p>spoilers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Many years before the war Luna had asked Celestia's help in starting her own School for Gifted Unicorns,  and Celestia agreed,  it was decided that it would be located away from Canterlot to prevent people from drawing to many connections between the two or having Tia's overshadow Luna's. There were three possible locations to consider,  one of them Crescent Moon Valley was the one Celestia instantly decided on,  for the sole,  only reason of...she wanted to see Luna's face when she told her she'd be sending all of Luna's students "TO THE MOON!!!" </span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Said valley was right on the border with the Zebra lands,  which at the time was not an issue since relations were cordial. But several years after the war started a Zebra refugeee convoy was passing through the valley,  when they refused to halt or identify themselves as they approched the School,  they activated the defenses,  soon as the first shot were fired the ponies realzed there mistake but it was to late,  one of the few actually armed guards for the convoy got inside the walls and set off a massive gas bomb that killed every pony there,  most of whom were students and teachers.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Celestia blamed herself for all those innocent ponies dying,  simply due to her wanting to play a practical joke on her sister and became so greif strickin she step back into the shadow's and let Luna take the fore (she didn't go away entirly,  she just swapped positions with luna)</span>

            @Seraphem: fair enough just my adhoc referencing to put things in my perspective spare of the moment from my POV at the moment. In time I'm sure I will disagree or re-agree with how that or anything else I splattered out in those post as well. My mood was semi-serious and I don't have too strong a feelings over it one way or another. Also don't take it as me claiming or defending 4Chan not a fan of the place but I'm not gonnna act afraid of it and won't act like it doesn't exist either. But I do see your what your saying
<p></p>Just had a lot on my mind,  not claiming that it was actually a very significant "a lot" but I had "a lot" and I needed to get it out.

            So yesterday I spent roughly two hours slowly trying to catch up to this thread while playing <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSouls" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a>.  I made it through about 15 pages,  but when I was done there were 10 more pages added.  So I guess I'll admit defeat and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreadHop" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreadHop">Thread Hop</a>.

            Mage: Both unicorn and pegasus is a fairly good fit for me and when I thought about this the first time it was a pretty tough call.  Unicorn would fit a lot of what I do on a day to day basis,  but I'm good at and fond of agility and reflex based activities.  In the end,  it's a want that tips the scale.  I'd like to experience flight in the way that a winged creature would.  So TLDR: pegasus.
