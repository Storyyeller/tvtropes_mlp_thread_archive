            Thing is a hero can still win easily without being over competent. Again <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreamstone" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreamstone">The Dreamstone</a>,  the heroes are usually completely useless but rarely get a hair out of place because the villains screw things up in a convinient manner. No way the heroes won was rootable because they never seemed to properly earn it or exert much effort into things,  even when the villains did something genuinely competent. It didn't help the heroes were completely boring compared to the villains though,  so got no pathos to gain audience sympathy. The more I think about this show,  the more I think you would loathe it no end.
<p></p>Maybe that's why you don't like infallible heroes,  they don't have to put much hardship into their work.

            I think I had a pony dream last night.
<p></p>Well,  more like a bizarre mishmash of several styles and various odds and ends,  the main of which was ponies. It did have a somewhat 22-minute episodic structure,  with a beginning,  an end and a somewhat discernible storyline. Spike was the main character and he was in his teenage form (Minus the greed,  so I guess it was a natural growth). Also,  Rarity going from town to town by train to gather materials for some kind of party to cheer up Spike. Then a bad guy shows up,  who Spike then defeats.
<p></p>Also,  Wayne Brady's popped up for some reason. Not even the person; there was a town along Rarity's route that celebrated the CONCEPT of Wayne Brady.
<p></p>Uh,  yeah. And there was a whole lot of random non-pony things and stylistic changes and junk. It wasn't even really set in Ponyville.

            For some reason,  Sonic is a rare case of a fairly <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">Invincible Hero</a> I actually like,  if only because it's a bit subtle and cockiness plays into his character as whole (as in not just smugness because every villain is incompetent). The only time I thought it got insufferable was in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonicX" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonicX">Sonic X</a>,  and that's only because he was so bland in it.
<p></p>Watching Lesson Zero,  as polarizing as it is,  it's pretty much the point I started adoring Twilight's character.

As shown in Dog and Pony Show,  he isn't completely useless in combat so it would be cool to see him in action.
