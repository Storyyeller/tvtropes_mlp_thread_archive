            I do agree that she should have gotten some form of punishment,  but at the same time I don't think she was quite a Karma Houdini either.  If the CMC had found out about her history sooner it might have caused them to respond differently to her bullying and resolved the situation some other way.
<p></p>I wouldn't consider her background an excuse either.  Even if she didn't get punished (which I agree she should have; make her fix the pumpkin float or something),  I don't think the show <em>ever</em> portrayed it as "oh it's okay because she was bullied".  Her actions were still never shown to be anything but nasty,  even if she never got her comeuppance for it.  Again,  the point of the episode was to show that being bullied shouldn't lead to bullying others.

<p></p><span class="blue">Positive results of the episode is that the little kid gets her whole situation turned around,  learns a valuable lesson about not being a dick,  and both Babs and the CMC gain a new friend.</span>

The only purpose of punishment is to try and change a person's state-of-mind to prevent them from making further mistakes.  Yes,  there are certainly some misdeeds that are serious enough to warrant punishment no matter the situation,  but I don't believe this is one of them.</span>

            People don't always get punished for their actions in this show. See Suite and Elite for another example.

            Which,  honestly,  makes it more realistic.  People <em>don't</em> always get what they deserve.  Which sucks,  but it's how things are.  (Although if I had been in AJ's place I still would have made Babs clean up the clubhouse or something).
<p></p>And I have to say,  the lack of punishment is a lot more palatable because Babs' only victims were the CMC,  and they were totally okay with it.  If she had been bullying <em>other</em> ponies,  then yeah,  more should have been done.  But I think that if the only party who suffered is willing to forgive them,  it isn't quite as big of a deal.

            @Japanese Teeth: It kind of was. "she got bullied!" resulted in absolutely nothing but the other characters thinking of how they can make things nicer for her,  rather than also trying to resolve their own situation with her. Whilst that shows a generosity to the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs">CM Cs</a>,  it also demonstrates how easily they can be used as a doormat. Bad example. I also think that the cycle of revenge depiction is problematic,  the message in general should have just been no bullying. Period.
<p></p>@Bluespade: Not necessarily. As a consequence of Babs' presence,  even after she leaves that may cause DT and SS to be even worse bullies than they already are. Also,  my problem isn't that Babs learned her lesson. It's <em>how</em> she learned her lesson. It wasn't through any personal introspection,  or anything like that. It was as a result of the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs">CM Cs</a> doing that pretty much on her behalf.
<p></p>Just to make it clear,  I'm still waiting on a huge consequence for DT and SS.

            @Patty: I just think it's worth pointing out that that the CMC's decision to stop the sabotage when they learned about Babs' past wasn't <em>solely</em> due to "Oh she was bullied,  so that makes everything okay",  it was at least partially their realization that if they went through with it they'd just be prolonging the cycle of bullying.  They realized that they were starting to show traits of being bullies themselves. Even if it was a given that Babs deserved it,  they might have called it off anyway just because they wouldn't want to do the same thing she did.
<p></p>Also,  I can't complain too much about the whole "not thinking of how to improve their own situation thing" because they literally only had about a minute to disarm the timer,  so thinking "how can we get her to stop bullying us" wasn't their top priority at the moment.  It's entirely possible that they'd have moved onto that after the parade was over.  I could totally see them taking the new information and confronting her over it.
<p></p>Other than that,  I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree,  though.  For me at least,  the fact that Babs learned her lesson is far more important than <em>how</em> she learned it.  As long as it's believable within the show's context (and I think it is) I'm fine with it.

            I guess so,  and I respect that we have our differences. I think my final say on the matter would be how I'd see the episode from the point of view of my eight year old self - it would tell me that I am probably just as bad as the bullies are (note: I know this is a slight warping of the message,  you know,  self-esteem and all). I can't help but think of it in the context of how the target audience,  especially bully victims that age,  will receive it,  because this specific story is something I have been so personally involved with. The <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs">CM Cs</a> conjuring the bravery to confront Babs,  have Babs realise what she is doing and then learn to stand up for herself back home,  would have been much more meaningful than the actual handling of it.

            So I just finished the episode.  My thoughts:
<p></p>Confound you Babs,  you drive me to conflicted feelings.  On the one hand,  I totally sympathize with your plight back home.  And I have no doubt that you are a nice filly overall.  But...I cannot find a justification for your actions.  And yes...you got off a little bit too easy.  But ultimately,  I'm happy with the episode's outcome.  Everyone who needed to learn a lesson learnt it,  friendships have been established...and DT and SS got a mud bath.  So,  I'm happy.
<p></p>And I'm going to come out and say that I do know <em>exactly</em> what Babs was going through.  After I dealt with my bullies,  I swore that I would never be a victim to anybody ever again.  From then on,  first time anyone gave me any trouble,  I would respond with overwhelming retribution to knock it in the bud there and then.  But I would <em>never</em> start victimizing anyone to draw attention anyway from myself.  Unfortunately...my way isn't the best example to teach to kids.  Otherwise,  Babs would have battered DT and SS the second they opened their mouths.  Ultimately,  the show took a better route in my opinion. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            I think if there is one thing you can fault the episode is that despite it being about bullying,  it didn't do much anything with the series recurring bullies. I understand the reasons they did that becuase,  well DT & SS are really pathetic as bullies at this point,  the only reason DT was able to become more interesting because she received a position of power.
And two (and probably the most unfortunate and annoying) is that they ultimately needed to preserve the status quo. I still would have liked something to be done with them other then having their token appearance and enabling the situation.
