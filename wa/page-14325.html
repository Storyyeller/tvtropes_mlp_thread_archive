            @NES: The comic shows that changelings basically taking over an existing area and basically adapting it completely to their needs,  so I'm going with the idea that they can adapt to pretty much any biome.  Makes sense for a parasitic species with shapeshifting abilities.

            Darkabomination: Have you caught up yet? Bt yeah. I love how changelings are treated by Harmony Theory. Calumn is awesome.
<p></p>@Ace: Well,  the only one I can think of off-hoof is really intense and also actually mature (which honestly makes sense from the premise that Shining is too traumatised to have sex with his wife). As I said though,  it gets pretty intense. A lot of it is showing you just how much Shining and Cadance have been messed up by the situation. And then you get angry at one of them. And two chapters later you’re kicking yourself because you are reminded how badly they’ve been affected by this. Anyway,  it’s called <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/CadenceInAMinor" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/CadenceInAMinor">Cadence In A Minor</a> if you want to check it out.

            My theory is that Applejack is by far the youngest of the Mane Six; but she is old for her age (meaning that her bone structure is that of an older pony than she actually is)  (this is the reverse of my condition,  when I was Twelve,  I had a seven-year-old bone structure).  She's also big for her age (I was very small for my age,  as you can guess).
<p></p>This is why she was the last in her class to get her cutie mark; she was actually a year or two younger than everyone else in the class; but was moved up to those who were the same bodily age as her (and thus,  would have been less mature and less likely to find her destiny at such a young age).
<p></p>When Applejack actually stops growing,  she will be larger than most ponies; as befits a workhorse.  Big Mackintosh has also not stopped growing and has the same condition of being old for his age.  By association,  Apple Bloom is also possibly old for her age; which might explain why she hasn't gotten her cutie mark yet.
<p></p>Scootaloo,  on the other hand,  is young for her age; as her wings should have developed enough for a little flight by now,  but they haven't,  but they will.

<p></p>As for <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheImmortalGame" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheImmortalGame">The Immortal Game</a>,  I also really enjoyed it. Especially its portrayel of Celestia. But as I said,  the coolest thing to come from that fic is spellblades,  but we know they can't becanon. If Rarity really <em>was</em> a bladecaster,  she'd have used Vorpal by now. Also,  by the end,  <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Twilight</span> is so stupidly powerful compared to everything else that you can't imagine future threats to Equestria ever mattering any more.
<p></p>EDIT: By the way,  it seems that the person starting the Cadanceverse is basically writing th whole first story before she uploads it. And is getting close to finnishing it.

<p></p>Scale seemed a bit small at times though. Like Celestia not being too much older than one thousand. The world being only 3400 years old at best.

            Big Mac might not get any <em>taller</em>,  but there might still be room for him to bulk up a bit more.  Or he's just got enough years on AJ that he's already full grown.  Wonder what the age gap between the three siblings is.

            @Japanese Teeth: in the flashback shown in cuite mark chronicles: Big Mac looked about as old as AJ is now,  AJ looked slightly older than Applebloom is now,  and Applebloom didn't appear to be born yet. i hope that helps.

My personal guess is that he's a few years closer in age to AJ than AJ is to Apple Bloom.  If I had to guess I'd put AJ at 19-22,  Big Mac in his late twenties (27-28).  Problem is that Apple Bloom's personality and school level imply that she's around 10-12,  which makes Big Macintosh nearly 20 years older than her.  It's certainly possible,  but that might be stretching it a little.  Moving Big Mac down to 24-25 helps a bit,  but that might make him and AJ a bit to close.  Then again,  in Cutie Mark Chronicles,  it's entirely possible that he's only 3-4 years older.

            @Badwolf: I also liked Titan. He made a good villian. I'll agree that the scale seemed small and resulted in some weird things (like Celestia being about ten times as powerful as Luna) but it seemed to go with the interpretation that the gods' more impressive abilities were more <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> type magic than sheer overwhelming power which meant the more mundane stuff could be scaled back a bit. So basically the gods have ludicrous amounts of HAX but their stats aren't as great.
<p></p>Ooh! Here's a fun discussion. Which version of the Royal Sisters' parents are the worst parents? The ones from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheImmortalGame" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheImmortalGame">The Immortal Game</a> or the ones from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/MyLittleAlicorn" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/MyLittleAlicorn">My Little Alicorn</a>?
