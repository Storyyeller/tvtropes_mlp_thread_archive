<p></p>Hmm... you don't suppose we could get <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatJesus" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatJesus">Bat Jesus</a> to wake them up? I mean,  we'd have to check and see if he's done patrolling Proteus from the Lizard Bot Twos,  but <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">maybe someone could build some sort of mystical symbol of which could either contact Bat Jesus himself or wake up the unicorns,  thus cutting the middleman</a>.

            My best guess is that Celestia and Luna both have supreme power,  but that they each have a ministry underneath them that handles day-to-day minutiae and things like that.  Goddess or no,  Celestia can't stamp everything that needs to be stamped even in a kingdom as small as Equestria,  so there have to be ponies who help with that.

            Today's just been depressing so far,  and it's only halfway through.
<p></p>Ended up getting shorted an hour of sleep because I woke up only to find that my cell phone/alarm clock died on me. Had to spend more time than I needed awake just to charge the stupid thing.
<p></p>Then I go into work at my mom's tattoo shop. I do the supply check as usual,  opening her cabinet,  when I turn around and the whole thing falls down on me. All of the supplies spill out,  red ink splatters everywhere including my clothes,  and the bandage container shatters. What results is 20 minutes of cleaning while the cabinet's stabilized for use.
<p></p>All in all,  I REALLY need a pick-me-up at this point. Something I haven't already seen.

            Maybe the ministers always need to run their decisions by her? So her job is essentially hitting something with a yes or no stamp,  and then she gets called up fro really important stuff?

            It seems to me that Celestia is the kind of person that would want input from the average pony,  so she would at the very least have some kind of Senate or Parliament. There was certainly one before her and Luna came around (<em>Chancellor</em> Puddinghead)and I doubt they would disband it after coming to power.

            I'm sure she's very competent.  She's had a thousand years of running the kingdom smoothly on her own,  after all. =)  She doesn't handle everything,  but she must still have responsibilities.  Even the tea party in "A Bird In The Hoof",  which by all indications was a planned event scheduled weeks in advance,  lasted an hour,  tops,  before she had to go back to Canterlot.
<p></p>Being able to spend time with Twilight and her friends at the Gala must have been a major relief... not to mention that she gets to relax with her sister now,  too. =)

<p></p>So,  what's Prince Blueblood,  <em>The Magnifent's</em> actual authority? Does he manage Canterlot or is he a second route of getting something authorised just under Celestia in the food chain?
