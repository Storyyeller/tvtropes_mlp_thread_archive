            <em>The Red Wheelbarrow</em>
<p></p>Oh I remember that one. That's one of the clearest examples ever of Lit teachers being full of B.S.
If that can be considered poetry,  than any random words a four year old strings together can be as well.

            Yeah,  I remember that one too.  I actually like (good) poetry,  but stuff like that is a prime example of "I'm going to take a regular sentence and put random line breaks in".

            Oh god I remember "The Red Wheel Barrow" and trying to explain the meaning of why so much depends on it.
<p></p>Explicating poems is BS.... who the hell knows what the poet meant when they wrote it.  Most likely they were tripping on something and the poem doesn't mean anything.

            Yeah,  for poetry explication,  you can make up any random nonsense and it doesn't matter.
<p></p>In stanza 4,  the author used lots of long vowel sounds to create an urgent atmosphere in the reader. This reinforces the subject matter of the poem by making the reader feel their impending mortality. blah blah blah
<p></p>Also,  anyone want to try a Python CTF? I created one for fun and I'm curious if anyone can beat it.

In college a lot of the analysis we did was more along the lines of examining the poet's background and trying to understand how it influenced their writing.  There's actually a basis for that kind of stuff.  It's when people move from "what did the author say?" to "what do I want it to say?" that it becomes stupid.

            Well it is possible to make legitimate theories on that stuff,  but I think most of what the lit teachers expect fails the Turing Test. I bet a computer could be programed to churn out this nonsense and get all As.

            I wish I had a better appreciation for per-modernity works overall (poetry,  Novels,  plays) but it never captures me. I think Emily Dickerson is one of my favorites from that era but after I read The Waste Land and liked it I knew I was gonna have a harder time appreciating earlier works.

            @Mousa,  RE: art of the list: Hm.... <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryingToFindANiceWayToRipThisApart" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryingToFindANiceWayToRipThisApart">Hm...</a>
<p></p>Well,  first of all you sound a bit too close to the microphone. Like,  your voice sounds really fuzzy and just kinda off... I'd say either turn down your mic reception or back away from it. Your volume will be lower,  and you'll get a much clearer sound.
<p></p>As far as the singing itself,  it's alright,  though you're a bit clutzy and it's usually fairly clear when you pause for breath. But I don't imagine you do much singing,  so it's forgivable. Your voice itself <em>sounds</em> nice,  but it's hampered by the issues with delivery
<p></p>The lyrics are pretty good(I think; the muffled delivery makes it hard to make out a bit,  as does poor enunciation in some spots),  and certainly fit Twilight's character. I could imagine a bit of animation actually going along with it,  which I imagine was probably the intention. Thing is,  though,  while your general rhythm is there the lyrics stumble and force a few beats. Like,  I can hear you trying to stretch a single syllable across a beat where there should be two,  and occasionally you have a two-syllable word where it just sounds like there should be a word change. Things like that. I'd try comparing your lyrics side by side with the original,  saying them out loud and seeing how they feel next to each other. If it doesn't feel spot-on,  try reworking it.
<p></p>On the whole,  it's... alright. I've certainly heard worse,  but I wouldn't quite call it good. Passable,  yes. But not really exemplary in any way. Had it been something I'd stumbled across on Youtube,  I probably wouldn't have finished.
<p></p>TL;DR: Move away from your mic to get better voice reception,  work a bit on the lyrics to make them flow better,  and enunciate a bit better while you're singing. It's not terrible,  but it's not great.

I lucked out in college and got a guy who was actually a published poet and had a good sense of how to approach the material.  Unlike in high school when I suspect that the teacher had never tried to <em>write</em> a poem before and thus didn't really know what things to focus on.
<p></p>Dang,  now I want to start writing poetry again.

            I'm in a year-long English class and it has to be my favorite. It's almost impossible to get an A in anything,  but it's a fun class. And He likes to analyze as well. Our professor doesn't try to force us to find an analysis. If we can't think of anything,  he either gives us random stories or moves on to another poem. Plus,  we can chose the poems we wish to talk about XD.
