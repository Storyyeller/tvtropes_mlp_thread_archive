            Watched the episode a bit ago. And Bluespade was definitely right about the shipping fuel. I still don't think it compares to the thing with Twilight and Rarity at the end of Crystal Empire. I don't know why,  I might have just been in a <em>really</em> shippy mood when I saw it.
<p></p>Anyway,  I really liked Pinkie in this episode for some reason and I found the thing about some other pony remembering the Mane 6 as their friends when they get the care package strangely hilarious.
<p></p>And for some reason Pinkie opening and closing the mailbox made me think of checking the thread for new posts on a slow day.

<p></p>They easily could have worked it in without the excessive shipping. Just have hte mane 6 want to check up on her or watch during the finals,  or something.

            <div class="quoteblock">What I'm still trying to figure out is,  Whether Spitfire put RD as a wingpony to try and teach her to work as part of a team,  or whether she genuinely though that LD would lead RD well. I mean,  On the one hand it would almost make more sense to make them both leaders of separate teams,  but on the other RD and LD where the only ones who could keep up with each other,  and the fact that LD liked to push meant that they were liable to do a little extra. At the same time though,  Spitfire does know what Dash is capable of,  so it seems like a bit of a waste. </div>

            @Story: That's because at the point she made the teams LD seemed to legitimately be pushing herself as much or more than RD was.  It wasn't until after the teams were made that it became evident that LD wasn't leadership material.  Which was honestly the whole point. Spitfire already <em>knew</em> that RD could lead effectively (she oversaw the water gathering in Hurricane Fluttershy after all),  but what she <em>didn't</em> know was how RD would handle following somepony else,  hence why RD was the wingpony.
<p></p>As for LD's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">Draco in Leather Pants</a> thing,  on one hand,  what she did was tremendously dickish and terrible.  On the other hand,  learning from one's mistakes and overcoming flaws is a <em>major</em> theme in the series,  so I find it unlikely that one nasty incident,  bad as it is,  would completely ruin any chance she ever has of getting back in.  If (and I admit it's a <em>really</em> big IF) she acknowledges that she royally screwed up and honestly resolved to be a better team player,  I could definitely see the Wonderbolts allowing her to return to the tryouts.  It wouldn't get glossed over,  of course,  but I do think it's entirely possible that she could redeem herself.  Whether or not she would do that is something we don't know.
<p></p>The only characters in the show who are utterly irredeemable are those who refuse to acknowledge or learn from their flaws.

After Spitfire <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">chews out Rainbow Dash</a> and RD responds with "No,  Ma'am! I'd never quit ma'am!",  Spitfire smiles. Nice little hint she <em>does</em> recognize ol' Rainbow Dash,  for those who think she's acting way <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter">Out of Character</a>.
