            Lurker: I kind of carpet bombed in terms of throwing resumes at every tech place with an opening (and some without) both local and some online.  Out of all that,  I got a single call,  which ended in me getting my current job (working with database apps).  It wasn't the best case scenario (my aims were similar to Keg's,  except without the benefit of the specialized formal schooling... although I've pretty much been informally designing stuff since I was 5),  but it could also be much worse.

            Yeah... to be honest,  this whole thing is freaking me out a fair bit too. It's sort of easy to just want school to keep going,  and to not actually have to <em>get</em> a job. But it's probably easier for someone in your position,  a field that's always looking for new people. Game design is so unstable,  and so... <em>weird</em>,  not to mention competitive and person-based. My biggest fear has always been,  "what if it doesn't happen"? I mean,  what if I don't luckily meet the right person to get me the good job,  or any job at all? What am I going to do if this backfires or fails? All of the things I want to do have this chance of failing spectacularly on me. Teacher has always been an idea that I've kept on backup,  but that requires going to school for another 4 years,  plus a good 10 grand on top of the 50 I already owe...
<p></p>I'm sure it'll turn out fine,  but I can't help but be nervous. Ah,  well. I've sent the application to Eidos. They contacted ME,  so I've got a good feeling about it. We'll see where that takes me,  I guess. And I've got a month and a half before I go out to Montreal,  so it's not like I'm in a huge rush to get employed.
<p></p>Well,  okay,  I am. But it's not like there's an immediate time limit.

            Part of the reason I'm in Grad School now is because I didn't know where to get a job.  The other part was wanting to have a better grip on the material before trying to teach it to somebody else.  I've had too many teachers who didn't have a good grip on the material,  and I don't want to be one of those people.

            There's just a really bad complication in my case... I kind of got rejected by my department for taking too long to finish Computer Science. And I was <em>this close</em>,  too. Seven years gone down the drain.
<p></p>Now I'm kind of in limbo,  hoping another department will take me in when the next semester rolls in. I have no idea how things are going to turn out. <strike>I get on the internet so I don't have to think about everything.</strike>

            They rejected you for taking too long? How does that work? Do you at least keep your credits?

            Yeah,  basically,  I can't stay in the same course (I think you guys would call it a "major") for more than 1.5 times its normal length. It's a rule they have here. Computer Science is only supposed to be for 4 years,  so that goes to a maximum of 6. And I already had a 1 year extension on <em>that</em>.
<p></p>But I'm still credited for all the subjects I've already taken,  so I won't have to retake,  say,  all the General Education ones. Assuming I can transfer to somewhere else. If I'm lucky,  either Computer Engineering or Electronics and Communications Engineering.
<p></p>What I've really wanted to get into is Math or Physics,  but that door is closed to me now. At least for this university. Maybe something will open up later,  but for now,  I have to move forward. Wherever forward happens to go.

            Kyler,  why can't you take math? That seems like the best option,  since at least at my school,  there's a lot of overlap between the CS and Math majors.

<p></p>The good news is that I got the ending where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the reapers are destroyed and my Shepard lives (I think... hard to tell)</span>
<p></p>The bad news is I have very little idea what happend... It doesn't even have a what happens next... They could have at least done a few screens of text so I know what happened to the people I know...
<p></p>So,  what does my post have to do with ponies? Err... *runs*
