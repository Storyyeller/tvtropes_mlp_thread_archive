            So do you think they're deliberately teasing about Scootaloo's parental and flying situations?

            Well,  considering that there wasn't so much as a fakeout regarding her parents,  they can't be teasing that. As for her flying,  what's being teased about it? We <em>know</em> she can't fly. This episode just reinforced it.

            So apparently right after the first episode of MLP Online came out,  they got a Cease & Desist.
<p></p>That was one of the few fangames that was a) really good and b) on a good track to be completed.
<p></p>Seriously,  fuck trademark law.  "Defend or lose it" is one of the most toxic things that's ever been put into law in the first place,  and applying it to nonprofit works of any sort is just utterly retarded.

<p></p>I love how Luna had mentor role here.  It show her development in this season she look like pony can rule Equestria and lead ponies.
<p></p>Also Scoot Voice Acting,  it was so great to hear those emotions in her.

            Random: Just watched "Show Stoppers" with commentary.  Two interesting things:
<p></p>1. Daniel Ingram doesn't get to see the songs animated until like a year after he writes them.  Also,  they apparently had a tough time getting Scootaloo's voice actress to sing badly,  and they actually had to digitially mess up her pitch to make her sound bad.
<p></p>2. They actually referenced Scootaloo's family thing.  One of the writers mentioned the "where's Scootaloo's family?" question.  Nicole Oliver responded with "Well,  she's Celestia's-" and got cut off by one of the producers yelling "NO NO NO THAT'S NOT CANON!"
