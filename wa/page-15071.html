            Ponification.  I mean not an <em>actual</em> ponification of Gensokyo etc.,  but a pony shmup that's basically a Danmakufu with some obvious similarities (spellcards with flowery names drawing from occasionally obscure mythology,  Twilight's got Reimu's homing shot type,  a couple characters have a spell that looks suspiciously like Master Spark,  etc).
<p></p>I guess I could make an actual crossover stage where you fight Yukari or something.  Probably Reimu and Marisa as midbosses.

            Probably for the best,  at least among your family. You definitely need to talk to your professor,  or tutor,  or program director or <em>something</em>. My Academic Director once told me there was a girl in my course who failed by pretty much the same amount as you,  and it was close enough the director went back over some of her work and decided it was actually enough for her to pass. I've had professors bump up marks from previous assignments simply for asking for advice on <em>future</em> projects. There's always a chance <em>something</em> can be pulled off,  so you should always exhaust every possible avenue.

            I will of course seek a remark but it's a shame my tutor hates me though.  Says I'm too beligerent and easily offended,  and lazy to boot.  I guess the marks speak for themselves with regards to that.
<p></p>I'll see what options are available certainly but I think I'm done with university.  I think I just need to severe ties with this place and go out into the world.  Try to find a happy life.

            I wouldn't give up just yet. As far as your tutor goes,  it's very possible that he doesn't hate you,  he just has trouble with you because you don't like <em>him</em>,  and that may come across. I... honestly can't find myself disagreeing that you're at least a <em>tad</em> belligerent. Getting better,  but really.

            It seems that someone listed Twilight as an example of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBureaucrat" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBureaucrat">Badass Bureaucrat</a> for what she did in Winter Wrap Up.
<p></p>I guess it's a subjective matter,  but does it really counts as something "badass"?

Going in with an attitude of defeat is counterproductive. If you're going to keep gunning for it,  you've got to keep your morale up.
<p></p>Maybe search up some Pinkie Pie pics on Derpibooru or something. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> I would say no. Heck,  I don't think she even qualifies for the "bureaucrat" bit.
<p></p>In general,  people tend to misuse the "badass" label all over the place.

            Deleting it on the basis of not being "Badass" or whatever is something that might cause a problem.
<p></p>However,  it is true that Twilight doesn't exactly count as a bureaucrat; she doesn't hold any <em>official</em> position of authority.

            I saw this matter touched on in a /mlp/ thread earlier today,  and now I can't get it out of my head... Would Celestia be able to take on Superman in a fight?
<p></p>Superman's more powerful,  but Celestia does have control of the sun - the source of Superman's powers. Would she be able to drain the solar energy in his cells? Would she be able to generate red sun radiation?

            It's a rather hefty assumption that Superman is more powerful,  though. We have no way of accurately measuring Celestia's power,  only scaling it based on others - and we have no way of measuring <em>their</em> power,  either.

            It depends on the circumstance.  Superman is so stupidly fast that he could probably take her out before she knew what happened.
<p></p>Then again,  Superman does have a weakness to magic (I think; I might be misremembering) so that might give Celestia an edge.
<p></p>As for her sun-powers,  they're so nebulously defined that we really can't say for sure how that would work.

            Also,  I was under the impression that the exact nature and limitations of Superman's powers are greatly dependent on who's writing him?

            Superman is indeed vulnerable to magic - he's not quite <em>normally</em> affected by magical whatsits,  as he's still able to take a lightning bolt to the chest and keep fighting,  but he's really no stronger than your average non-brick super. Which is still pretty fucking tough.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Exact numbers will vary,  but in practice it more depends on the <em>era</em> he's written in. He used to be basically god,  then they dialed him back rather significantly,  and now he's gotten a decent boost again. He can lift several million pounds these days,  I think. Really,  he's about as strong as he needs to be,  and most writers are smart enough not to assign a number.

            Currently,  his maximum strength is just about enough to pull the planet,  he's tough enough to withstand supernovas (perhaps even several at once),  and he can fly several times faster than the speed of light.  This is still fairly significantly below what he was like in the Silver Age,  though,  where he could <em>accidentally</em> blow away entire solar systems with a <em>sneeze</em>.

<p></p>but yeah,  it would depend on just how powerful Celestia really is. But Supes doesn't have any uber protection against magic,  he's just as vulnerable to it as anyone else,  though his natural toughness does mitigate some direct attacks.
