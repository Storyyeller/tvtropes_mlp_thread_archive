            @Kyler I just figured that  DT had to pick up her bitchiness from somewhere,  and I don't think it was her dad. He actually seems like the type who'd be controlled by his wife if he had one,  doesn't he?

<p></p>Oh right.  I don't know though...none of them really do it for me.
And is it just me,   or is the fanon machine really dead these days?
Or maybe I'm just not paying enough attention.

I just don't think the Hulk is as interesting as,  say,  Batman,  Iron Man or Captain America.

            So I got an idea as to how the Elements of Harmony work when used offensively.
