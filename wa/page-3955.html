            Yeah,  we've seen the Spike/Rarity comic more than once already. I've saved it.
<p></p>Actually,  a better example of what the ponies are being punished for is far more in line with the show. Friends split up and worked independantly of each other,  not letting each other know the details of each others work.
<p></p>About Tara's trolling. It reminds me. Trolling seems to be Equestria's national pastime. It's the only thing they kept from Discord's reign.

            It just seems so pointlessly spiteful to me. Maybe it's just a difference of worldviews; I recognize that reality can be bleak,  yes,  but I'm a very idealistic person,  and I don't like seeing good be punished. I guess I can kind of see why it went south,  but something about it feels like the author was just using it as an excuse to say "ha ha you bitch" to one of their least favourite characters. If you're going to insert a moment like that,  it should be to sort of drive the feeling,  and if it's dark even compared to the rest of the story it's not really doing it,  is it?
<p></p>I'm probably just being too doylist about this,  but all I get from it is the author's feelings on the character,  not how the character actually relates to the story. Does it tie back to anything? Does it have a point?

            @kegisak Nope. No point. that's my personal problem with the scene too. It's only purpose is to be mean.

            I didn't get the feeling that the author hated her,  but no,  it doesn't serve as a plot point except to drive home the themes,  and just how messed up Equestria is at that point.

Even the villians are sympathetic.  Really the only thing I think isn't justifiable is Rarity's fate.  The benefit wasn't worth the cost,  but it was her decision to make and no one else's.
