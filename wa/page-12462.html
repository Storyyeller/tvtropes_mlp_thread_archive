            Thinking of the bodyswapping "Pinkie with magic" idea made me think of something.  As their characters currently are,  Rainbow Dash and Twilight both are very invested in the powers they have as a pegasus and a unicorn,  respectively.  It made me wonder,  what would the cast members lives' or characters be like if they were different pony types?  I know that Fluttershy as an Earth pony and Pinkie as a pegasus were the original ideas for those characters,  but what about the others?  Applejack as a pegasus might not be that different,  but what about her as a unicorn?  Or Rainbow Dash as a unicorn/Earth pony?  Twilight as a pegasus or an Earth pony?  Some guesses:
<p></p><ul><li>Twilight would be very studious about gardening or something like that as an Earth pony,  and she would still study a lot.  As a pegasus,  she would probably spend a lot of time calculating weather patterns and be somewhat of the record keeper or the mathematician of the weather team.
</li><li>Rainbow Dash as a unicorn would probably be the type to focus on spells that look flashy rather than things that might be <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a>.  Her as an Earth pony wouldn't be that different than the way she is already,  except she would focus on running speed and agility rather than flying,  of course.
</li><li>Rarity as a pegasus might be the type to focus on being the most graceful flyer ever,  and if she was ever asked to help with the weather making,  she would probably take to that like she takes to making fashion in the show—she might end up focusing more on how the weather should look rather than its function.  Applejack,  of course,  would be the opposite if she was a pegasus.

            That was more "Rarity as a Special Snowflake and letting it go to her head".   If she was turned into a normal Pegasus or if she was born a Pegasus I would imagine she'd be utilizing her talents to make pretty storms and such.
<p></p>And if Applejack is ALSO heaviliy invested in her abilities as an Earth Pony even though those aren't as obvious as Twilight's or Rainbow Dash's.  Do you think if the Apple Family was Pegasus they'd own a farm considering what's been established so far?  Imagining AJ as anything other than an Earth Pony is actually very difficult considering so much of her life is centered around the farm,  and that family ties that come from working on a farm.  If AJ was a Pegasus in a family of Earth Ponies though I could see her using magic to take care of the apples or as a Pegasus,  ensure that the weather was Perfect for Apple harvest.   It would be a bit sad in that case though because it would create a bit of distance from her and the rest of her family.

            She might use the air currents she kicks up to help knock the apples loose from their branches,  mind.
<p></p>AJ as a Unicorn... well,  's a bit tricky,  but she would probably specialize in all sorts of agricultural knowhow so she can still support the farm despite not being an Earth Pony. Also she'd know some plant-assist spells and have very well-developed TK to help move things with her mind/horn.

            AJ as a unicorn would probably focus less on the actual farming an more on infrastructure; figuring out how to make the farm run more efficiently,  etc.  As a pegasus,  she could manipulate the weather in a way that directly benefits the farm. No matter what race she is,  she'd still find a way to be useful.  Her being an EP just means she takes a more hooves-on approach.

            I just noticed  that  Celestia and Luna taking over (in benevolent sense where ponies were happy about it) Equestria after they liberated  it from Discord  is similar to  something in other show.
<p></p>Similar happen in Babylon 5 backstory.  History of Mimbary and Valen.  Valen (in reality Commander Sinclair) showed up during previous Shadow War and lead Mimbari to victory,  after that  he recreated Mimbrarii society become center character of their  religion and philosophy.
<p></p>It sound cool even if not all B5 stuff is OK (while Valen and Sinclair is  great  Mimbrari are something between cool and annoying).

            The casting gag would be amusing,  but I think that switching Rarity and AJ would make for a much more entertaining episode.  Especially if they have to take on each other's duties for some reason.  Or even just trying to go about daily life.  Can you image how Rarity would cope with not having telekinesis,  or AJ trying to buck apples in Rarity's body?  (While Rarity is mortified that AJ is <em>ruining</em> her hooficure)

<p></p>Rarity with Fluttershy? It might be funny to see Rarity have to deal with the animals.

            @Rainbow: I'd switch them like this:
<p></p><ul><li>AJ and Rarity,  for reasons already mentioned.
<p></p></li><li>Twilight and Fluttershy: Twilight would be hilarious attempting to deal with animals,  and I'm sure you could get some good stuff out of Fluttershy (mis)using Twilight's magic.
<p></p></li><li>Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie.  Rainbow Dash has to deal with not having wings,  and Pinkie would be able to <em>fly</em>.

            @Panic: Yeah,  Ilike Flutterspike. I like Rarispike too,  but Flutterspikewa my first ship from this show.
<p></p>@Kegi: Yeah it's really fun. Pity that I barely ever get to play these days.
<p></p>@Kegi and Story: Yeah,  sorry about that. Work was insane. I mightbe able to do it again in a week-ish though?
<p></p>On how the mane 6 would be as other races: Interesting points. Although,  for AJ,  it would heavily depend on if her fmily was still earthponies or not.
<p></p>Also,  my headcanon is that the land of Equestria is <em>dead</em>. If even a human planted a flower in Equestrian soil,  it would die. Only earth pony magic is capable of overcoming that.

            @Sereg: my fanon is that Equestria is slowly recovering,  but until the scars of previous disasters heal completely the ponies still need to do a lot of work to keep the ecosystem rolling.
