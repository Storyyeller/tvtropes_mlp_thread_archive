            Unlike the others though Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash were at Summer Flight Camp. When you're at camp you tend to be away from your parents so it'd be illogical to show them.

            again yes there are good reasons. but the fact remains that every single one of the 6 non-pegasi main ponies have their parents seen or mentioned,  while none of the pegasi have. Just an odd thing

            I'm just going with the whole Greco-roman theme the Pegasi seem to have.
<p></p>Their cloud buildings all have buildings with pillars like in Greece and Rome.
<p></p>Their armor in Hearthswarming eve has the Spartan horsehair crest.
<p></p>This is why I have sort of decided that they are culturally similar to the Spartans or something... where children were raised away from their parents in groups.

            Maybe it's a rite of passage. A sign that you are a true Pegasi warrior.
<p></p>You look your parents in the eye,  and you reject them in favour of your army. You get sent off for training,  and you never see them again. Celestia daren't intervene with their culture because she knows that the Pegasi armies could easily destroy Equestria,  seeing as they're raised to be completely indifferent to anything but their army. Their unit is their family. They share all their bad times,  and all their good.
<p></p>Maybe 'Shy and Dash failed,  which is why they're not in the military. (Well,  until Dash joined the Air Force in Wonderbolt Academy.)

            Yeah,  the only reason we haven't seen Rainbow and Fluttershy's parents is there really hasn't been an opportunity to really show them. They're also from Cloudsdale instead of Ponyville,  so presumably their parents are still up in the clouds somewhere.
<p></p>As for Scootaloo's parents,  they <em>could</em> have had a scene of her getting permission to go camping from her legal guardians in "Sleepless in Ponyville",  but the writers opted for Sweetie Belle/Rarity shenanigans and it didn't affect the plot in any way.
<p></p>Also,  with the parents we <em>do</em> have,  we don't have a lot of information. Twilight's parents are a G1 Twilight <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> and some blue guy. Pinkie's parents are Amish rock farmers. We don't even know if Rarity's dad is a unicorn or not and he and Rarity's mom have the most personality out of all the Mane Six parents!
<p></p>Something I just realized. This season we've gotten cameos from Magnum (Rarity's dad) and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Clyde</a> (Pinkie's dad). Think we're due for an appearance from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Nightlight</a> (Twilight's dad)?

            Eh,  I still don't think it's anything other than an odd coincidence. Yeah,  it's a bit weird that the 1/3rd of the cast whose parents we haven't seen are all pegasi,  but that's out of a cast of only 9 ponies,  several of whom are related to each other.  If we were talking about a cast of like 20 ponies and it was still the case I'd suspect something,  but 9 isn't that much,  especially when there are other explanations for their absence. Like the fact that Fluttershy and RD's parents probably live in Cloudsdale,  and we've only had like 2 episodes set there.  Scootaloo's a bit more of an anomaly,  but I'm chalking it up to the fact that there just haven't been any plots where her parents would be important enough to mention.  Not saying that it's impossible that Pegasi do their own thing,  but given the whole emphasis on solidarity in the show I would find it <em>way</em> weirder that pegasi have communal children than the fact that we've never seen the parents of 3 characters who just happen to be pegasi.

            Lightning and Gilda free Discord,  who discords Luna into becoming Nightmare Moon,  who then summons Chrysalis for round two against Equestria.
<p></p>It should be the last episode: "The Last War of Equestria."
<p></p>It ends with a mortally-wounded Twilight clutching a magic bomb,  facing down the Discorded Lunar Changelings,  and then just saying:

            I think they would seek revenge,  but would end up find redemption instead.
<p></p>That way they could redeem both characters in one episode if they chose to.
