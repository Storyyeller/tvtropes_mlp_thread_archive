<p></p>You do? What exactly was there to like? We know absolutely nothing about them. They just appeared out of the blue and took over the stage from characters that we do know and care about.
<p></p>All I know about them is 'very nice people that are important to Twilight and love each other' and that's it. No character flaws,  no character strengths,  just a whole bunch of 'okay person'.
<p></p>I'd say they are the most boring characters that have gotten a speaking role up to now.

<p></p>Glaring flaws. Like what? All I can think of is the lack of forshadowing given for Cadance and SA. As I said,  I didn't mind the added focus on those two since I thought they were pretty likable

            @ pipping,  that assumes that most ponies give a buck about who is captain of the royal guard. Can you name the person in charge of the Secret Service? How about the person in charge of your local police? This is what makes a lot of people nitpick,  they are <em>assuming</em> that the show will follow the typical tropes of storytelling,  when the show goes for a more realistic style,  we don't know stuff the Mane 6 don't mostly. And most of the stuff people say we should know/they should do. there's no reason for them outside of narrative cliche.

            Yeah,  SA. Being the cool big bro that he is,  could have taught Twi the Bubble Sheild spell.
<p></p>It would actually make sense if he was the one who encouraged her to study magic. (Even if that comes with it's own can of worms) Or at least some advanced techniques.

            The one real problem I have with the episode is how Celestia was taken out so easily. It's really not so much that as it is how inactive she is throughout the season. I have no real problem with the Worf Effect is it gets the story moving,  but you can't really pull <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a> if Worf never <em>did</em> anything.

            Lauren left a lot of gaps in the story so she had material for future episodes,  apparently.
<p></p><em><span class="purple">Did you say... Gaps?</span></em>
<p></p>Yes,  but I wasn't talking abo<em>hey don't sneak up on me like that</em> <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>(ahem) Anyways,  the only problem I can see is that fans fill in the gaps with fanon until a new episode comes along and burns a hole in the fanon so it can fit.

            To be honest there was really no way to properly foreshadow SA and Cadence in a show like this. But still even though I thought they were all right as one-shot characters the fact that they eclipsed the Mane Six (minus Twilight) in the finale of their own show was kind of a deal breaker for me.
