Never learning a lesson doesn't make Pinkie a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a>,  it just means she isn't undergoing proper <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> like the rest of the mane cast. And,  while Twilight does have the potential to be a Sue,  her magical power is almost always handled properly to make sure that it doesn't overshadow everyone else.

You cant deny that Twilight is propably third most powerfull pony in the world (after princesses).
<p></p>And Pinkei is no sue because she don't have traits of sue. Her powers works only for jokes,  they wasn't any usefull,  no pony say how awesome Pinkie powers are,  or how awesome she is (that was sayed about others from Mane Cast). How many times she save the day? Defeat villain? Solve conflict?

            Yeah,  I don't have an explanation for Pinkie's speed or how she found the one book Twilight was looking for. Maybe that one can be explained by the fact that she lived in Ponyville a lot longer than Twilight? :l
<p></p>And,  as it's been said above,  the Pinkie Sense lasted for one episode and was then forgotten,  it's pretty short-term,  didn't help at all while trying to stop Nightmare Moon in the pilot (where it would've been the most helpful) and didn't determine anything important. In the last case,  the "doozy",  it's simply a self-fulfilling prophecy. So it's not that big a deal,  to me at least. :/
<p></p>And you're not the only one who has a problem with the moral,  gingerninja. It's supposed to be "trust your friends before being skeptical",  not "have some faith,  you stupid scientist." But it's very easy for it to come across that way and it bugs me too. I think that whole episode could've been done better.

<p></p>Finding the book was just plot expedience disguised as a joke.  Why spend time digging through books when Pinkie can just pull it out of nowhere and the plot can move on?  And when Pinkie outruns RD in a race or other serious context,  not as a gag,  then I'll be annoyed by it.

            The reason I don't consider Twilight as overpowered due to her magic is the way that she's shown to use it; it's never an "instant solution" kind of thing unless it's a plot point.  And the fact that she's the best at one particular thing is countered by the fact that she has all sorts of other flaws.  Huge power levels are only bad when they're a detriment to the story,  and I really haven't seen any episodes where it is.  You can have a character be really good at something and still have them be well rounded.

As I said I LOVE Twilight,  just not that part of her. Do people see where I'm coming from?

            I think it would be a bigger problem if the show wasn't basically structured around social interaction; yeah,  Twilight is good at magic,  but it doesn't really come up all that often.  It's like doing a show about the world's best baseball player that takes place while he's on vacation during the offseason.  It'll come up on occasion,  but it's not the point of the show.

Moral was oposite,  it was something like "you shouldn't hold to dogmatic beliefs for any cost"  because Twiglt was dogmatic here.
<p></p>And real moral was about trusting friends,  I got this first time when I watched.

            It was that self-fulfilling prophecy that bugged me aswell.

            That episode would have ended much better if Twilight had decided that just because she though the Pinkie sense was crazy,  she didn't need to go around trying to disprove things her friends believed in.
