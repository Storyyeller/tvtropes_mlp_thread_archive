            Really any episode that shows Twi and Cheerilee interacting more.  I've always liked the idea that the two are friends and hang out between episodes.

            The one thing that bugged me about the finale is that the other Mane Six were kinda just... there. They really didn't support their friend who usually turns out to be right,  and they didn't contribute to the plot (<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeavisAndButthead" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeavisAndButthead">Heh heh,  plot</a>).

            My favorite fanon is the stuff involving Lyra's human obession,  along with anything that involves shipping.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue"> And the Trollestia/Molestia stuff is good for a laugh or two,  especially if you consider them to be two diffrent pony's then Celesita herself {Clones,  perhaps?}.
<p></p>Least favorite fanon? Well,  I would say the whole <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cupcakes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cupcakes">Cupcakes</a> thing,  but I've seen too many funny drawings/comics and read a great fanfic based off of it to really dislike it that much.

They range from Pinkie rushing to RD's house in the middle of the night to ensure she's alive,  to the reveal of it being a fanfic written by Twilight,  and they're filming the TV version.

            You know what I want to see next season?
<p></p>An AJ episode. JUST an AJ episode. Not an 'AJ and Applebloom' episode,  but a good,  solid,  honest to goodness AJ episode. Because all we got last season was Last Roundup,  and that was still more about the rest of the girls.
<p></p>I'd really like the focus to be on everyone's favourite cowpony for once. Hell,  maybe she could even get a song! We know pretty much for sure she'd be a good singer,  after all.
<p></p>She and Big Mac seem to like to make bets,  maybe it could be about that?

            It isn't so much that I mind Cupcakes itself,  its that I dislike the way it tends to inform her character or reactions to her character everywhere else.  Yes Pinkie goes crazy sometimes,  but it's more of a depressed crazy,  not axe murderer crazy.

            @marston My personal favorite was the one where Twilight and Spike stumble on Pinkie,  and Pinkie ends up falling into some surgical equipment and dying. Meanwhile,  Spike,  upstairs,  accidently turns on the "Cupcakes" song on Pinkie's record player.
<p></p>@keg Also,  that idea for the episode where Big Mac goes into <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a> mode to track down the CMC after they skip school,  only to be saving them from AJ's wrath.

            Yeah,  I want to see a Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy episode,  too. "Griffon The Brush-Off" seemed to hint that Fluttershy secretly considers Pinkie to be an annoying foal. "Putting Your Hoof Down" had Fluttershy pretty much telling Pinkie what she really thinks about her to her face. It just seems to me that an episode where the two of them try to understand each other should happen!
<p></p>I want to see an episode where Ponyville and Cloudsdale start having paranoia about Changelings,  and wondering if there are any among them. I believe this is a legitimate concern,  because there have been a lot of duplicates,  different voices,  and mistakes made with background ponies. You could have a plot that is a G-rated version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCrucible" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCrucible">The Crucible</a></em>,  where someponies,  like Diamond Tiara,  use this as an excuse to make life miserable for the Apple family,  and ponies need to figure out just where exactly do their loyalties lie.

<p></p>As for my least favorite fanon,  it's Gilda,  Discord,  or Chrysalis being presented as Woobies with a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a>.

            @Sky: This is an excellent idea.

For her it's mostly overdone,  but it's just such a freaking LAZY writing tool. "Oh,  you don't like them? Well you're a jerk because life shat on their heads,  so it's okay for them to be mean".
<p></p>No,  I don't care what happened to them in the past,  I care about what they're doing NOW. You want them to be sympathetic you have two routes: You make life take a dump on them NOW,  and play them as actually being beaten down by it,  or you make them freaking improve.

            @Sky: That's a good one,  but my favorites are the one where it turned out that Pinkie and RD were acting in an Alfred Hitchcock film,  the one where the fic was written by Fluttershy after she listened to too many death metal songs,  and the one where RD kills Pinkie in self-defense,  just because I lol'd at how quickly RD got over killing her friend who had just tried to murder her.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
