It makes me wince to see the fandom thinks Sombra is sympathetic and Iron Will as a total monster.

            Sombra did little during his on-screen appearances,  this is true... most of his actions,  and his personality for that matter,  were setup before the episode... which actually tells us a LOT about him. The mere fact he went out of his way to have a triply redundant security system puts him miles above the other villains thus far. The only other villain who had even a semblance of a plan was Chrysalis,  and even then she was pretty shoddy at holding it together.
<p></p>In terms of what he did,  Sombra was easily the best villan... but I'll admit in terms of watchability,  he's not much to speak of.

            If there is a villain with Sombra's effort and Discord's personality,  it would be a great villain.

If he'd had Discord's screen time,  and we still only knew as much as we do now,  that would be bad writing.  As-is,  he did his job; he was a threat that existed so the story could progress.

            Agreed. Although,  I do kinda wish he HAD been a front-and-center villain... I've even begun to warm up to his design after seeing it in action,  which is odd because I found it really grating when I first saw it.

            I've seen King Sombra being compared to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordOfTheRings" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordOfTheRings">Sauron</a> multiple times. And yes,  they do have alot of simularities,  including the whole "More of a force of evil then an actual charactor" thing and the fact that when they both died there was only one thing left from them {Sombra's horn,  Sauron's Ring}.
<p></p>Any particular reason as to why his horn wasn't destroyed by the blast,  or was that just another LOTR refrence thrown in for good measure? You'd think that it would leave open the possibility of Sombra returning,  but since he's been confirmed to be <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>......
