            @Ginger:  For the record,  there was a massive statistics compilation awhile back regarding ponibooru posts,  and the CMC were just about dead even,  only varying by one or two percent.  So if the amount of art being produced is any indication,  Scoots is no less popular than the other two.

If she sang during the Perfect Stallion song,  it would have been a continuity error,  something this show tries very hard to avoid.  Besides,  just because she hasn't gotten focus yet doesn't mean she never will. People were saying the same thing about Sweetie Belle before Sisterhooves Social happened.

            @Perpetual Lurker:  Actually,  this is a good point.  Season one Applebloom got all the focus.  Season two Sweetie Belle seemed to be in charge.  Could season three be the season of the Scootaloo?

            Only 13 episodes are <em>confirmed</em>,  but they've been hiring more and more production staff long after they should have stopped for a half length season. At least a full third season is <em>extremely</em> likely,  especially after the crazy ratings the finale pulled in.

            Song in her imagination where she's great at everything and can even fly then cuts to her not being able to do all that stuff? Want,  especially since it would be a Scootaloo episode. Would be sad though.
