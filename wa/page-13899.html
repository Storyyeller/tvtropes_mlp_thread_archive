            Well Women have only ceased to be the property of men within the last 100 years or so (in the US at least).  They do have a few things to be bitter about.
<p></p>They shouldn't be as bitter as they are and just get on with their lives... but I understand where they are coming from.

            Of course,  that same Ms. article person was perpetuating sexist lesbian stereotypes when she called Rainbow Dash a lesbian stereotype simply because of her rainbow mane and love of sports.  As a feminist myself,  I would scold her for that because she's the one making assumptions about Rainbow Dash's sexuality based off of things that don't have anything to do with romance or sex.  I thought that feminists were the ones who were supposed to be against that kind of thing (labeling any "tomboy" as a "lesbian") but I guess I was wrong. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">
<p></p>Like turtlebutter has the princess thing,  my feminist <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> (of sorts) related to the show is people assuming that Rainbow Dash is the lesbian based off of her sporty personality and mane color.  And I'm especially annoyed and disappointed that a supposed feminist may have started the meme,  or at least gave it more prominence.  However,  I don't mind people pointing out things like character interactions that they see romantic subtext in,  because that would be related to romance/sexual attraction.  I personally do not see any specific sexuality in Rainbow Dash and think that she could go either way,  considering she hasn't actually had any romances in canon,  but I can also understand people seeing shipping potential in certain scenes,  too.

            Not all fundamentalists are unreasonable,  bigoted,  close-minded,  or unwilling to consider other viewpoints.  Some of them gather their opinions through thought and research; and are glad to hear what people with different views have to say;and add that experience and knowledge to their own.  Some of them are willing to admit when they are wrong.
<p></p>Fundamentalism simply means strict adherence to certain rules and values.  It does not mean an unwillingness to question those rules and values; or to look beyond them.  It simply means that you choose to live by them in spirit and letter.
<p></p>Now,  over the last hundred years or so,  the term has obtained a connotation of rigid thinking and uncompromising rock-solid stances.  It has also obtained a connotation of being rude,  unreasonable,  bigoted,  petty,  overzealous,  etc.  Now the word is mostly used as a pejorative.
<p></p>So,  saying "Christian/Muslim/Jewish/Atheist/Rightwing/Leftwing/Atheist/Evangelical/Catholic/anythingelse fundamentalist" is like saying "(insert X group here)jerk" or "(insert X group here) dummy".
<p></p>Thus,  one might as well call another person a "Right-wing Christian boogerhead".
<p></p>Not all boogerheads are fundamentalist; and not all fundamentalists are boogerheads.  Some are,  and some aren't.

            I was trying to say that fundamentalism does not necessarily mean <em>unreasonably</em> strict and  unyielding.
<p></p>For example,  I have views on genocide that are incredibly strict and unyielding; and I am not willing to compromise on such.  By that standard,  my views on genocide are fundamentalist.  Just because one is fundamentalist on <em>that</em>,  doesn't mean one has to be fundamentalist on anything else; and it doesn't have to have any effect on whether or not one is willing to be polite,  reasonable,  open-minded,  and open-to-change.
<p></p>I am truly against close-mindedness,  and boogerheads; don't get me wrong.  I agree that said fundamentalist nutcases are fundamentalist nutcases; but I seem to have a different view of what the word "fundamentalist" means than anyone else in this century.
<p></p>But I digress.  Let's agree to disagree; and agree that we're both against fundamentalist close-minded boogerheads.  Okay?

            Hmmm.... Haflinger might work. It's close enough that people will probably get the reference.
<p></p>For context,  Spike is offering Pinkie cookies,  and this happens:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">“I've got chocolate chip,  oatmeal raisin,  and quartz chunk.  You probably don't want the quartz chunk though.  Twilight had one once and chipped a tooth.  They're on another plate..”
<p></p>“Chocolate chip,  duh!”  She skipped down the stairs,  and stopped dead as she saw the plate of cookies on the table.  Her face went white as a sheet and she gasped as if she had seen a ghost,  or maybe a zombie.  Zombies were scarier than ghosts.  “D-did you put both the chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin cookies on the same plate!?”
<p></p>“Um,  yes.”
<p></p>Pinkie reared up and flailed her forelegs. “NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!”
<p></p>Spike just stared. “What's the big deal?”
<p></p>“You never put oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip cookies on the same plate!  If you eat one,  you don't know which one you're getting and you always always always pick the wrong one!  Do you know how awful it feels to take a bite of what you think is going to be a sweet and ooey-gooey-chewy chocolate chip cookie and realize that it has raisins?  It's one of the greatest disappointments in life,  right up there next to not getting into the Wonderbolt Academy or being sent back to magic kindergarten!”
<p></p>Spike blinked. “That bad,  huh?”
<p></p>“Well,  maybe not that bad.  But it's still pretty bad.”
<p></p>“Can't you just like,  smell the difference or something?” Spike asked. “Raisins and chocolate smell different,  don't they?”
<p></p>“That's just what they want you to think!”
<p></p>“What who want you to think?”
<p></p>“The cookies!  They want to trick you into eating the wrong ones!”
<p></p>“Why would the cookies care?” Spike scratched his head. “Don't they want to be eaten?”
<p></p>“Exactly! That's the problem!” Pinkie stomped her hooves. “The oatmeal raisin cookies want to be eaten,  so they try to smell like the chocolate chip cookies!  Sometimes they even smell more like the chocolate chip cookies more than the real chocolate chip cookies.  They're very devious.”
<p></p>“Yeah...”
<p></p>“But the chocolate chip cookies know that,  so they start trying to smell more,  too!  Unfortunately,  the Oatmeal Raisin Confederacy tries to counteract it!  They infiltrate the ranks of the Chocolate Chip Alliance and leave raisin smell everywhere so you'll think that the the chocolate chip cookies are the imposters!  But they know that you know that they do that,  so they leave some of the raisin smell on themselves so when you pick up a cookie that you think is a chocolate chip cookie that smells like raisins,  but it's actually a genuine oatmeal raisin cookie! Watch!”
<p></p>She leaned in close to the cookie bowl and began to sniff.  “Hmmm... see?” She picked up a cookie,  and balanced it on her hoof.  “It smells just like chocolate!”
<p></p>“So,  does that mean it's....”
<p></p>“I have no idea!” Pinkie declared. “It's my theory that right now,  this cookie is neither chocolate chip nor oatmeal raisin!  It currently exists in an unknown state,  which will only be determined when I take a bite. At that point,  it will turn into whatever cookie I did not want.”  She took a bite,  and her face scrunched. “See?  Raisin!”</div>

            Morgan is indeed a horse breed.  It was named after the founder of the breed Justin Morgan.
<p></p>That sounds like a cute scene JT.  The cookies are in an indeterminate flavor state until bitten into... hah!
