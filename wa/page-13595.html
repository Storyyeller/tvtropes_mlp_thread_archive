            First song - bit corny.
<p></p>Second song - still a bit corny.
<p></p>Third song - Oh,  that is nice!
<p></p>Forth song - getting used to all the songs.
<p></p>Celestia song - That is beautiful!
<p></p>Coronation song - it feels so right!
<p></p>I like how I slowly grew to like the musical setup.
<p></p>Plus,  the ending reminded me so much of Star War IV:  A New Hope ending.

            I think the spell had a lot to do with it. Considering tha it caused the elements to vaporize her physical form and transfer her o a star-plane where her essence was remade and all that.

            Well that... I'm kinda not sure what to think of that.
<p></p>I mean,  I LIKED that episode. I loved the songs,  I thought they handled the whole ordeal pretty well... though I kinda had hoped that the book would have been something bigger than just fixing a half-assed spell. But on the other hand,  I do kinda have to wonder where they're gonna go with this. Alicorn is one thing,  but princess? What happens to Twilight's duties now? What's this new kind of teaching? Will Twilight still be living in Ponyville? Will they be shifting over to an adventure-type format? In a medium where traditionally <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>,  this is one HELL of a shakeup,  I'll admit.
<p></p>That said... The scene in the starry place? Super excited about that. Totally feeds into my fanon. And the standard joke:
<p></p>"What happened?"
<p></p>"You died!"

            Honestly,  my main problem isn't the speed of the resolution,  that made sense,  so much as the fact that we never got to delve into the implications of their destinies getting screwed up.  We just got "RD sucks with animals! Rarity sucks at weather! AJ sucks at making dresses!" and never got into their heads much.
<p></p>@Kegisak: Yeah,  if anything,  the #1 complaint I have is that there's no indication of WTF is going to happen now. We don't know what Twilight is doing,  or how the sudden ascension really affects her.
<p></p>That said,  I really like the fact that they based it on how much she's learned and the fact that she had to work for her rather than just going "You're the chosen one,  lol".

            it wasn't satisfying for season finale you would like a feast. This was an appetizer not even that barely even a free sample. They shut the plot points in our facess and it felt like the spit take took up valuable screen time everything was going by so fast.

            My guess,  the S4 premiere will cover the "what do I do <em>now</em>?" aspects of it.
<p></p>And yeah,  I'm not looking forward to all the inevitable RUINED FOREVER complaints. I just hope that if it bugs them that much,  they just drop the issue and go elsewhere rather than hanging around to complain about it.
