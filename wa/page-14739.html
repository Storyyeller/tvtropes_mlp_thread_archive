            So we're talking about dreams now,  huh? I've had a couple of odd pony dreams,  but there's only one that I can remember at the moment. Basiclly,  I had this dream where someone managed to make a Offical Mlp Fim spin-off that had a bit of a diffrent animation style to it {Albiet one that's probably more like some fanart pics},  but not so diffrent that the charectors looked bad or unfamiler. Apparently this episode ended with the recent <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> {Not sure if it was one of the canon Big Bad's or a new villain entirely} taking over Equestria and turning it into a wasteland. And somehow {I don't remember exactly what happend} this was apparently Twilight's fault that it happend,  which lead to most of her friends abandoning her to try and survive as well as taking care of their familes. It was kind of like what happend in the first part of the S2 finale,  only worse since Equestria was in ruins.
<p></p>But there was one pony who still stayed by her side despite this. Who was that pony? Rainbow Dash. Not only that,  but she was also the only one who wasn't really upset at Twilight about what happend. The episode ended with a rather hopefull cliffhanger indicating that Twi and RD came up with a plan to fix everything,  get their friends to join them and save Equestria. And then the episode and my dream ended and I never got to see what happend next. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokingMode" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokingMode">*Go's into a corner and cries like a little girl*</a>
<p></p>Also,  the dream kind of implied that Twilight and Rainbow Dash might have been together in a romantic sense too. Make of that what you will. :P

I volunteer to do a quick errand for my dad despite having this work to do and stinking to high heaven and the police nab me for briefly not wearing a seat belt.  That's a Â£30 fine right there.  My bottled up rage slipped out too.  Lets just say things got nasty and personal and both me and the two cops aren't feeling very good at the moment.

<p></p>But seriously,  I suggest to you â Applelight â that you find a safe and personal way of taking out your anger and other pent-up emotions. I personally find that talking to a counselor helps.
