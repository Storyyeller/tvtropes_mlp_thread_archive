            As far as I can tell,  [Grimdark] mostly appears to be "everything's gone to the crapper,  let's all wallow in... whatever ponies are supposed to wallow in". [Dark] just takes your normal pony setting and paints it in a more tragic light,  but there's at least a decent chance of a thought-provoking end.
<p></p>Mind you,  I know both probably have their share of gems,  but [Grimdark] just happens to be something I'm never in a mood to gamble on.

            Oh right,  I forgot that Ginger doesn't appreciate having spoilers hidden,  so <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the pegasi closed the sky and abandonned the other ponies after Cloudsdayle was destroyed.

            Well his backstory isn't really that tragic,  Ginger. As for <em>seeing him</em>,  not until they get to Fillydelphia. You <em>hear</em> about him for a good portion of the story,  but you don't actually <em>see</em> him until you're a good ways in.

            The thing that really,  really always irked me about Fallout 3 (again,  the only one I've played) is that it's been more than 200 years after the nuclear war,  and yet the entire landscape is still this big ruined wasteland.  There is no vegetation.  Nothing has been rebuilt,  people just squat in centuries old ruins,  which,  by the way,  still have electric power for some reason.  No one cleans up after themselves,  their houses all look like landfills and nobody seems to eat anything except centuries old trash.  It's utterly ridiculous.  There entire society is based around cannibalizing centuries old stuff that has no business still existing.  The whole thing is pretty much an <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotSetting" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotSetting">Idiot Setting</a> in my opinion (that should really be a trope).

            I have nothing against Grimdark in and of itself (I've read <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Berserk" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Berserk">Berserk</a> for crying out loud),  I just think that combining it with ponies pretty much destroys a lot of what makes the ponies fun to watch in the first place.  If I wanted to see characters get put through the wringer I'd read/watch a work that structured around that.

            I've read far more then bits and pieces,  it's just that I've read bits and pieces at a time.
<p></p>My issues with <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalloutEquestria" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalloutEquestria">Fallout Equestria</a> <em>are</em> with it's construction,  in fact with it's over all premise and execution. The greatest strengths of the show are not only in it's overtly human characters,  but also their relatbility,  and the over human themes and ideas that the show expresses,  Grim Dark fanfiction's purpose is the explore who these same themes and concepts hold up in a less idealistic setting.
<p></p>This is not what <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalloutEquestria" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalloutEquestria">Fallout Equestria</a> does.
<p></p>FE is just what it seems to be,  nothing more and nothing less,  a fanboy's attempt to merge two very different fandoms together. And that on it's own is fine,  and in that regard it is successful. But it's nothing more then that,  the Fallout elements are not there to further the MLP themes,  there is no real relateable humanity to it,  it the tone and elements of Fallout slapped onto to MLP,  just a little darker,  it feels like stuff was added because "Hey this would be cool!" rather then "Hey this would further the story!". It losses the humanity of MLP,  and instead of exploring the impact of these things on the ideas,  values,  and themes of the show,  it just tosses them on with a bunch of flashy lights and the barest semblance of symbolism. It's like reality TV: the view is tricked into believing they are having a profound emotional reaction by the bells and whistles when in reality there is very little of substance to be had.
<p></p>Combine that with it's uninspired dictation and how people are proclaiming to be on par with literary masterpieces and classics,  and it's recipe of my disdain.
<p></p>As a fanfiction FE is above average (there are still better ones out there) but it dosen't hold a candle to anyone's published worked.

            I'm not insulting you Ginger.  I just think you get too hung up on villains,  and therefore would presumably completely miss out on good pieces of work that don't have much in the way of a villain,  like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseOfLeaves" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseOfLeaves">House of Leaves</a> or Persona3 (just two random examples).

            @Ginger: I think he's just going off the fact that literally <em>every</em> time someone suggests a story or work to you,  your first question is almost always along the lines of "but does it have a cool villain?"  You can't really fault him for assuming that the selling point of a story for you when it seems to be the aspect of the story that you care most about.
