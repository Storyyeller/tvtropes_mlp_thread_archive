<p></p>Oh well.

            I <em>do</em> think it's one of the weaker episodes,  but at the same time I don't consider it nearly as awful as a lot of people seem to.  It just needed another round of editing before being put into production.

            a LOT of editing. Yeah I'm one of the ones that rates it as the worst episode of the series. mostly just for how out of character EVERYTHING felt,  not just the Mane 6,  RD,  but the entire setting. It simply did not feel,  at all,  like the rest of the show does.

            I don't think that makes it bad though.

<p></p>1. Made it clear that it took place over a longer period of time
<p></p>2. Shown the cast trying to talk to RD about her giant head before jumping right to the MMDW ruse
<p></p>It would be one of the better episodes.

            So I've just finished the "dreaded worst episode of the show" so was it gut-wretchingly bad as I thought it would be? Not really no,  now don't get me wrong this episode was still pretty bad,  the characters were acting really out of character and weren't acting like they should,  it felt like I was watching a completely different show with this episode and felt like I was watching a marvel superhero show rather than a show about multi-coloured rainbow ponies...it just really took me out of the show and quite frankly distracted me from what was going on. And the plot holes.....oh god the plot holes in this are astounding...I refuse to believe that this was going for days when the way they were describing it felt like a day than a week or so.
<p></p>People keep on saying it's the worst ever but to be honest,  I think I had more frustation with The Cutie Pox than I did with this episode. While it's not horrible enough to rival Not All Dogs Go to Heaven or The Great Divide,  it's certainly not a great episode by a landslide.

            No it's the consensus of the fandom overall though,  it always tops every single "Worst episode" poll by quite a wide margin.

            The construction zone wasn't that bad,  and the dam wouldn't have been a problem if not for the "Hydroelectric" part.
<p></p>As for the death cliff,  I actually heard a really good theory about it: It's a takeoff ramp for Pegasi hauling carts.
<p></p>@Story: Around here it's not,  but in the fandom at large it's one of the few episodes that people won't jump on you for complaining about. Even the people who <em>like</em> it admit that it has problems.
<p></p>My least favorite episodes are probably "Over A Barrel" and "Dragon Quest".  The former focused too much on side characters and the resolution wasn't very good,  and the latter set itself up like it was going to give us some information about dragons and Spike's past and then wasted it on the teenage dragons.

            @starscream: That was more or less the reaction I expected.
<p></p>I actually make something of a distinction between between episodes I think are the worst and those that are my least favorite.
<p></p>I think the worst episodes of the series are MMDW and the season three finale,  but my least favorite are Lesson Zero and It's About Time. . .yeah.

            Plus being made out of concrete by the looks of it,  something we've never seen even a hint the ponies had. A dam,  yeah,  THAT dam,  hell no. The construction things was freaking ludicrous. A crane? A full on freaking CRANE! Yeah it's made out of wood but,  still,  no,  just no. Plus the building they were making was completely at odds with every other structure we've seen,  and makes no damn sense in and off itself. The floors were so damn small,  and stacked so high.. it was like no one even tried to care about anything there.

            @Seraphem: Cranes aren't <em>that</em> complex.  Concrete isn't exactly out of place by the series' tech level either,  given that the <em>Romans</em> were known for using the stuff.  Just because they don't use it often doesn't mean they <em>never</em> use it.

<p></p>EDIT But let's discuss more pleasant things. In clebration of my new avatar,  let's match ponies to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeychainOfCreation" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeychainOfCreation">Keychain of Creation</a> characters.
<p></p>Misho = Twilight. Duh.
<p></p>Secret = Fluttershy
<p></p>Unless Fluttershy is Blossom.
<p></p>Sunset = Nova
<p></p>Marena = Rarity
<p></p>Karen = Applejack
<p></p>Ten Winds = Rainbow
<p></p>Mew Cai = Spike
<p></p>Pinkie = ... ... ... One of the fey brothers?
<p></p>Any other suggestions?
