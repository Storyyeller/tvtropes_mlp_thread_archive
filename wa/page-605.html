            I wonder how a transgendered pony would be received,  actually - in-universe,  that is,  since obviously Hasbro would never touch the issue.  Zecora's reception shows that ponies aren't universally loving,  but I wonder how much of that was that she mostly <em>appeared</em> different.  The ponies don't usually wear clothes,  as Applejack pointed out,  and I don't think there are any coat or mane colors that are exclusively reserved for male or female ponies (again,  from an in-universe perspective); the best a transsexual pony could do in everyday life would be to change his or her mane and tail style,  I think,  and there's the difference - Zecora is a zebra,  so I wonder how an outsider <em>pony</em> would be received.

            ^I was gonna mention that,  yeah,  but I didn't know how to phrase it without saying something along the lines of 'Yeah,  but of <em>course</em> they were afraid of her,  she <em>looks different</em>'.
<p></p>Anyway,  my point is that a transsexual pony wouldn't be immediately identifiable as 'other' barring mane styling and such,  and thus might not get as badly ostracized as poor Zecora did.

            That was the conclusion I came to,  as well. Just re-style your tail/mane and,  I guess,  undergo voice training and you're done.
<p></p>But then I started wondering if they would actually need voice training,  or if they could just have a unicorn magically give them a different voice.

            ^Maybe there's a unicorn who specializes in physical alterations.  Twilight's transformation magic only lasted as long as she was concentrating on it,  right?  That'd be rather disastrous if it were someone's larynx that had been transformed.

In one fic they simply crossdressed,  but in another they,  uh...<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">Gelded</a>,  though that wasn't strictly trans-ponies who did it.
<p></p>Basically,  most theories purport that surgery of the sort does not exist in equestria. It's likely for the sake of writing,  since they're clever enough to realize how little they know about the process and steer clear,  but there's a decent in universe explanation:it's hard to perform complex surgeries like organ transplants without hands. There are unicorns,  admittedly,  to take care of that,  but there's also plenty of other reasons. Cost,  possible social stigmas,  donors,  the issue of whether or not such treatments would even <em>exist</em> - keep in mind,  the first gender reassignment surgery was performed in 1930 - a time period which the ponies have not quite reached even to judge from the most advanced iterations of their technology.

            That's a fair point,  and an interesting one.  Surgery in general has to exist,  but reassignment surgery's on a rather more complex level.

            Yeah,  I thought about this at length a few weeks ago and I sorta reached the same stumbling block. I figured that SRS is too complex to be done without,  y'know,  hands,  but I started wondering how they handle other types of surgery. I mean,  they must have some form of medical treatment,  right? We've seen they have nurses,  at least.

            I was thinking the surgeons would have to be unicorns or something. Certainly not handling tools with their mouths.

            ^^Surgery definitely exists.  Fluttershy has a suite of tools in her house,  after all,  and not every injury can be fixed with a bandage and a lollipop.  Actually,  the theory I advanced in my fic 'Second Chance' is that Fluttershy takes home bodies (animal bodies!) she comes across in the Everfree Forest and studies them,  Vesalius-style.  I don't imagine anyone taught her what she knows,  after all,  and she wouldn't risk trial and error on a living creature.
<p></p>^Practicality aside,  it'd be unsanitary as all hell.  Maybe some enterprising pony invented a sort of hoof brace that can mount several surgical tools?

            There's the possibility of adhering the tools to the hooves somehow,  but the still lose out on a lot of manual dexterity without fingers. It may simply be that surgeon is a race-specific career,  like weather control.

            It's like they made 5 molds (Rarity,  Pinkie,  Applejack,  Twilight,  Rainbow) and then decided they never needed to make another one again. Fluttershy didn't even get her own.
<p></p>Also I don't get the "glitter" ones. Even the 8-year-old girl in me doesn't want those.
