            Don't see all that much in the race that would push Rarity's athleticism to the test,  the running is mostly short sprints,  most of the events are more about cooperation or skill. The only one that really would have taken strength is basically throwing Sweetie over the box stack.
<p></p>The egg carry was all about teamwork.
<p></p>The wi...grape juice vat,  Applejack could have just clued Rarity in before hand "hey jump on this end and they all fly right in" since that's probly what Applejack/Bloom do every year. Which would take some jumping accuracy but all that much.
<p></p>The pie eating,  I just figure was developed from hanging out with Pinkie to much,  either you get that food in your mouth ASAP or watch Pinkie grab it as you try and bite into it.
<p></p>And the most athletic parts would be wading through the mud hole,  which Rarity skipped by hiding at the far end,  and the final stretch with the hurdles,  which is where they ended up falling behind and losing.

<p></p>Unless you are attracted to them BECAUSE they are ponies,  in which case you're a furry.

            So I just got done watching the episode and catching up with the thread.
<p></p>I was completely surprised by Muddity as well. I didn't notice the eye color or hidden horn at all. Of course,  I spent most of the race trying to watch Derpy and Berry Punch.
<p></p>I do wonder how Rarity got so atheletic. Even if she isn't as fast and skilled as AJ,  she was still very talented.
<p></p>Edit: I guess ^^^ kind of makes sense.

<p></p>I noticed that she was Rarity when I got a close up of her horn,  and then I started to suspect it. I wasn't ENTIRELY sure,  since I didn't notice the eyes,  but I was genre savvy enough to know that that was probably what had happened.

            I still wonder how football is even supposed to work in Equestria. Like how do they throw the ball? Do they just kick it using magical pony kicking dexterity?

            So! I finally got a chance to watch the episode! I swear,  I need to start getting up earlier on Saturdays so I can watch them on the streams,  or something.
<p></p>I was... sort of underwhelmed. I mean it was a good episode,  and I like it,  but... I was so excited to see Sweetie's personality unfold,  and I guess I was just a little disappointed. I guess I was expecting something... I dunno,  cuter? Still,  I like how a lot of Rarity's traits come through in her too - she's got that stubbornness,  and that resentful streak. And what little personality she had before was definitely there too; her lack of forethought and single-mindedness. She just seemed sort of... irritable through the whole thing. But then again she wasn't exactly at her best in it,  and when she was upbeat at the beginning she was a lot of fun (I loved her scooting around on Rarity's floor when she was bored). So yeah,  I guess in general It was still a really good episode,  And I'm really glad to see Sweetie getting characterization,  but it's ultimately going to count among the slower,  less well-remembered episodes. Which is fine,  I guess,  as long as we still get to see a bit more of her character as the series goes on. She really is one of my favourites.
<p></p>And as a final note Rarity's parents were pretty funny too. I sort of got that 'going out of one's way to <em>not</em> be their parents' vibe. Also,  was anybody able to catch a glimpse of her dad's horn under that hat? Because I didn't... so Fluttershy may not be the one who ends up being half earth-pony.

            I never really noticed the dragging-self-on-ground thing she did till it was pointed out,  but I agree it was adorable. X3 I want to see more of her as well.

            Oh,  most definitely. She'd love having lots of foals running around to look after... and she'd probably have plenty of fun getting there too.

            You notice how when she runs out of gems for making her suit later in the plot,  she goes to find Sweetie's drawing? This means she's planning on taking them off an using them. Which means that they are perfectly usable after being put on the arts and crafts thing. Which means that she could have used them after Sweetie Belle glued them on. Which means <strong>she didn't have to go find anymore and didn't have to flip out on Sweetie!</strong> Why did she do this when she could just take them off and use them?????? It would take all of a second with her telekinesis!

            She could probably find one or two that are intact,  but the rest might be covered in glue.
<p></p>Or maybe she didn't want to take all of them off Sweetie Belle's picture,  but thought she wouldn't miss one.
