            I actually thought Pinkie was pretty good in this episode. She really only had one major gag,  and for the rest she was pretty stable,  and pretty sweet.

            I wasn't especially impressed with the episode on the whole but there were a few nice homages and the aesop was spot on.  And 'Shy managing to be assertive at the end has definitely helped my view on her.

But the part were Fluttershy flips out on Pinkie and Rarity,  you can see why Pinkie Pie was used,  because Applejack wouldn't put up with that stuff! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_evilgrin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="evil grin" title="evil grin"> even if it was Fluttershy.

            Such a cute episode! Although I was kind of disappointed other ponies didn't show up. But I'm looking forward to Rainbow Dash in Hurricane Fluttershy. I would love to see their relationship explored more. (And for new fics to form from that XD)

            Yeah,  I'm guessing they went with Pinkie and Rarity because AJ and Twilight would probably have stopped the Flutterbitch transformation in it's tracks,  and RD probably would have thought Iron Will was awesome.

I can understand raising the price of tomatoes a little bit if you're short on stock or something,  but running the price up like that is just nasty.

            Still think the goats were running the show. Iron Will consulted with them a couple of times.

            I do not like Iron Wil/Iron Will. Yes he was nice to Fluttershy in the end but his lessons were horrible ones as were the way he went about teaching them. And he didn't seem to change at all when the horribleness of his lessons were pointed out to him.

            @ginger: It works for me. Just step it up bit by bit until they give in... and Fluttershy even has my back up - intimidate.

It seemed to me like it occurred to him to be a bit more polite in the end of it. Mostly as an afterthought I'll admit,  but still.

            Yeah,  I thought I felt the kinder Pinkie coming to the fore in this ep. Good to see Merriweather is consistant about her.
<p></p>Flutters' rant against her was still REALLY satisfying though. Probably BECAUSE she felt more like a real person when it happened
