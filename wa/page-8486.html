            I appear!  However briefly that may be.  I don't think anybody who isn't already anti-pony is going to complain about the threads unless we're just spamming them.  If they're legit discussions,  there's no reason not to have them.
<p></p>I'd suggest a topic of conversation,  but I'm probably only going to be here for like five more minutes.

            @Ginger I don't think anyone was "cheering gleefully". There was one "Oh,  that's good, " comment,  and that's about it. In any case,  the constant cycle was getting a bit annoying. It always went a bit like this:
<p></p><ul><li>Ginger asks for spoilers,  gets angry when people try not to spoil him.
<p></p></li><li>People spoil Ginger. He gets angry because of the now out-of-context information he has from said spoilers.
<p></p></li><li>People argue about Ginger's points of dissension for several pages. Ginger remains angry.
<p></p></li><li>Ginger eventually reads the chapter. His overall response is "-_-".
