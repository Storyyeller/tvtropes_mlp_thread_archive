            @Mio There's ALWAYS someone out there who's better than you. It's the way the world works. If you want to be a hero or an athlete then it's absolutely VITAL that you get it in your head that someone WILL eventually outshine you. I'd say it's better that RD got the message punched in her head by her closest friends,  (who really were only trying to help) early on,  than having her learn it much later (and her ego would only grow the longer this went on btw) from someone she doesn't know,  and who she's much more likely to be volatile around.
<p></p>Talking generally doesn't work on RD,  she's far too egotistical for that

<p></p>I guess I just don't understand why her friends felt they needed to intervene on this occasion  rather then on other occasions where she behaved far worse.
<p></p>Also I have been on the receiving end of a somewhat similar plan to "correct" my behavior from my loved ones and let me tell you it <strong>did not</strong> have the desired effect (though admittedly they were try to teach me something different).

<p></p>but you get where I'm coming from though,  right?
<p></p>One thing they should've done though: I think this episode would've worked better if the mane cast were actually REMORSEFUL over what they did to RD. They may have been in the right,  but the cast were still going out of their way to outdo their best and most loyal friend. If they'd had more of a "We did what we had to. You NEEDED to learn this lesson. Can you ever forgive us?" kind of attitude... then I think it might've sat better with the fandom

That'll happen in third season. Scoots will get something related to dancing/athletism,  Apple gets making stuff and SB singing,  they just don't realise they don't have free will.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">She's acted worse? I can't recall.</div>
Yup,  "not rescuing someone who's in danger because she's being busy with her fans" is the worst thing she's ever done in the series willfullingly,  it is also an OOC moment - you know,  she <em>is an element of loyalty</em>.
<p></p>I also don't like it how the mane cast fails to realize her craving for attention only becomes worse as they keep one-upping her.

<p></p>I guess I can see where you are coming from. They did have the best of intentions at heart,  and it was probably better that she learned this lesson from friends now then later on from a terrible disaster.

She was sure Applejack cheated on her first. Notice how Applejack then cheated back,  so it's not impossible for the element of honesty to cheat. That is definitely not worse than endangering someone's life against their will.

Becuase by that point the race had stopped being about speed,  and devolved into who could win by any means necessary. At which point the only rule was win,  so therefore not sheating to do anything to win.
