            Also,  the security crackdown might have been bad enough that all outgoing mail from Canterlot had to be carefully sensored to prevent intel from leaking.
<p></p>I'm still amused that a good human actor could out-imitate any Fair Folk with decent practice without dropping as many hints as Chrysalis did.

            @Ginger: I dunno. Personally,  I think she's more like Trixie,  all about illusions and the like. If there was a near-deific being running around the countryside before,  things would probably look a lot less serene.

<p></p>We never saw her using any of her powers on anypony who wasn't Shining Armor,  and that also begs the question of why Twilight was the only one seemingly unaffected (though I guess you can chalk that up to her knowing Cadence better).

            Or maybe it was the queen's influence over SA? I know she didn't have full control over him until the wedding day,  but mayhaps the love drain was still influencing him a little bit and writing a letter to twi himself just didn't enter his head because of it

            Sorry,  I just never liked the idea of Luna being stronger OR more skilled. Maybe it's beause I like older siblings being the strong ones and I like to think that:
<p></p>subtlety = greater power.
<p></p>Luna shows off her powers on a whim but Celestia is very delicate and sparse in their use

            I still think that Cadance had to change bridesmaids because they noticed something.
<p></p>Also,  Twilight's special talent is <em>magic</em>. Using it against her may not work as well.
<p></p>Also,  I also want to see the happy couple in season 3.
<p></p>EDIT: I agree that Celestia is stronger. But Luna may not need to hold back as much. Also,  I happen to <em>have</em> a younger sister who is <em>much</em> stronger than me,  so I see no problem with it in fiction.

            Re: AJ's "OOC-ness"
<p></p>It wasn't,  there is a HUGE difference between what she was assuming "Cadance" did and what Blueblood did,  which is the comparison your drawing. First off she didn't SEE Cadance do anything,  she only heard about it from Twi,  and even then she just took it to mean Cadance didn't care for the tarts,  but was trying to be nice to spare her feelings. Perfectly resonable.
<p></p>What Blueblood did was insult her food,  he dind't just say it was bad,  he basically called it garbage JUST becuase it was "commoner food" There is a huge difference between simply not liking the way something tastes,  but being polite,  and insulting something just becuase you think it's beneath you.

            I think this is something you guys should know about me. Whenever I get myself into any product,  I strive to enjoy it. So when I see people nitpicking products that I think are overall good,  I think,  "Are you trying to find ways to hate it?" The only time I willingly nitpick is when the flaws are to hard for me to explain away using cannon material.
<p></p>I may be in the minority in this regard,  but that is how I am.

<p></p>For the last week orso,  perhaps. How long would they have known about this threat? Twilight didn't only not know about the wedding,  she didn't even know that Shining was dating Cadence in the first place. Assuming that ponies do have some sense that means they have been together for at least,  say,  half a year. Considering the oh,  so special bond Twilight and Shining shared,  she would have known at least that much.
<p></p>I'm fine with people liking the episode,  but if they are going to make up shoddy excuses like that,  I get slightly annoyed.

<p></p>exactly.
<p></p>And we don't KNOW anything,  that's the issue your saying "oh this should have happend" or "He/they/she should have done this" with absolutly ZERO knowldge of just what was going on,  we don't know how long they were together,  we don't know how long the shield was up. You can't be pissed becuase people did not act a certain way,  when you have no idea what was going on at the time.
<p></p>And as other stated the letter from Dragon Quest could very well have been telling Twi about her brother,  we DON'T KNOW. Seeing as there is just as many perfectly logical explanations that fit all the WE KNOW FOR SURE,  as there are the opposite..reasons that make everyone look idiotic. There's no point intentionally trying to find the most negative possible explantion that requires making assumptions there is no basis for.

<p></p>For how long? How long had he and Cadence been dating? Weeks? Months? Whatever it is,  Chrysalis had only switched with Cadence in the past few days.
<p></p>If Shining Armour is half the brother he's been described as,  he would have written Twilight about the fact that he was dating her beloved foalsitter long before any changelings got in the picture.

            @Sereg,  what I mean is that I see Celestia as being more experienced in using magic because she's both older,  and hasn't been loked away on the moon for 1000 years,  so in my head it makes sense for her to be stronger and more skilled. You know me,  experience trumps natural ability in my head EVERY time
