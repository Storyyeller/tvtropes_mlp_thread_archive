<p></p>Oh well,  /art/ on ponychan is a risky but effective measure of trawling if you hide the nsfw stuff,  or just dig hard into Derpibooru lol.

            That was a very weird and wild episode,  in my opinion.  I was a little bothered that Twilight won by basically tricking Trixie,  rather than doing it herself,  but then I realized that it was Twilight beating Trixie at stage magic,  which is what Trixie usually does.  It was also subtly showing that good stage magicians have assistants who help out and aid with the process of making illusions (and are willing participants).  And at the end,  Twilight said that she actually couldn't do those kinds of spells for real,  rather than lying and making others think that she could do things that she actually couldn't (like Trixie claiming she could defeat an Ursa Major).
<p></p>I don't really think it was that predictable,  if I hadn't read the spoilers beforehand,  I probably would have fallen for Twilight's age spell,  although I wasn't quite sure how she had done it and that was the only one I knew was a trick so at first I also thought that she had aged up Applejack and turned her into a boy.  I didn't know what "the six" was supposed to mean until it was pointed out on this forum,  I had thought it had something to do with a 9 upside-down.  I also did NOT expect Fluttershy to be in that log,  either,  I thought she was going to slip out really fast while the dome was lifted up or something,  or that they were going to cut a hole through the dome somehow.
<p></p>This one sure had a lot of shout-outs and continuity nods,  too.  As well as the reference to Winter Wrap Up and to Pinkie's past on the rock farm,  it also had Golden Harvest running off with Dinky,  and I remember they were seen together in earlier episodes.  While the dome was something I saw as being similar to the Simpsons movie,  the shop at the beginning reminded me of Borgin and Burkes from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a> instead,  and Trixie being corrupted by the amulet made me think of the One Ring from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordOfTheRings" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordOfTheRings">Lord of the Rings</a> (or the locket Horcrux from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a> as well).
<p></p>I was also most relieved when Pinkie finally got her mouth back at the end of the episode.  When I saw Snips and Snails were back to normal,  I thought that Pinkie would be too,  but the poor girl had to spend most of the story with no mouth!

            Just finished watching the new episode.
<p></p>I wonder if that shop in the beginning has <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gremlins" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gremlins">mogwai?</a> and did anyone hope for a cave with Twilights doppelganger in it?
<p></p>Glad the ending ended the way it did though.  After seeing what Trixie went through after Boast Busters I felt a bit sorry for her.

            Interesting facts here:
<p></p>Despite R63!AJ actually being Big Mac in disguise,  Ashleigh is credited as voicing "Male Applejack". Also,  Lee Trokar voiced the shopkeeper and the beavers.

            I'm surprised shippers haven't leapt at Rarity and AJ snuggling together early on.  The two actually seem to be getting a lot of moments together so far this season.
<p></p>My head was spinning trying to keep track of all the continuity and callbacks in this episode.  Also,  4th wall-breaking Twilight.

            I really love Trixie design from episode. Well  that addition of cloak,  amulet and evil colors. I love mix of blue and red (especially with blue body and red eyes).
<p></p>To bad we probably don't see  that again. Trixie will not use that amulet.
<p></p>Unless Twilight father get this or  Luna.

            I'm overall satisfied with it,  though,  since they managed to keep Trixie true to character even when apologizing. She more or less incapable of being humble in the slightest. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
