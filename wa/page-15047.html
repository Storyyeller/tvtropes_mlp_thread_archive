            @Syd: His full name is <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigMcLargeHuge" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigMcLargeHuge">Flash Sentry</a>. And they do make some efforts to give him dimension,  although admittedly at this point the dimension is mostly in the sort of 'noble and true' type. But he does enough important stuff over the course of the movie that it's pretty clear he's got some potential for an interesting personality. Persistent,  a tad snarky,  investigative,  that sort of thing. He could make for an interesting character,  and lets face it - it's not like the other male characters <em>aren't</em> a bit one-note.

            @Pykrete:
I guess that's the more critical way of putting it,  but,  yeah,  pretty much. Flash and Sunset really needed better development than just following their character archtypes completely by the books (Though I did like a few moments with Flash). It's decent. Much better than expect but not that great.

            Well,  EQG sounds like it turned out okay. The only thing I'm worried about is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> potential romance involving the canon cast.  Not because I have anything against the idea or because it gets in the way of shipping,  but because unless it's done <em>really</em> well I can't see it really adding much.  It's just not something I want to see in the show proper because the show just isn't <em>about</em> that kind of thing.</span>

            If I had to guess from right here,  right now,  I'd say <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Twilight will have a few run-ins with him and will be cute and awkward,  but it's unlikely it'll ever be an actual plot of an episode,  and it's 50 50 if it'll even <em>go</em> anywhere or if it'll be just kinda there. There's definitely no chance of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> and any overall relationship I'd say would be a sort of relaxed,  comfortable background thing</span>
<p></p>Because you're right,  really. I mean,  balancing romance with relationships would make for a decent moral,  but there's just no call for it given the show's target market,  so I doubt they'll go there.

He is a general nice guy and is willing to really help out Twilight when she needs it so if he does show up and they give him a decent showing then I can see him develop into a good character as well as a good match for Twilight.

            Flash Sentry is close to a synonym for Shining Armour. If Twilight ends up with him I'm gonna call incest shenanigans.

            @storyyeller: Unless Flash makes an appearance or the mirror is used again,  I can't really see it affecting season 4 in any way.

            @Sereg: All of those were isolated incidents that didn't follow over into other episodes.  All other romance is between characters who were already together.  And honestly,  I don't count any of the Spike stuff.  That's a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush">Precocious Crush</a> that would require a <em>lot</em> of development to actually be a legit romance.
<p></p>@Kegisak: Glad to hear it.
<p></p>Also,  I have a random question: What would be the pony equivalent of a driver's test?  Something they'd have to pass an exam to get a license for.  Anything is workable as long as it's plausible that Twilight might have one.

            Isn't there a trope for that?  Where a character goes to another world or back in time and has a romance with someone,  and then when they come back there's a copy of that person that they can have a relationship with despite it not actually being the same person?  That trope has always really bugged me.

            I'll admit it would be amusing if Twilight tries to hook up with the pony version of the guy and he has no clue why the Princess is suddenly so interested.
