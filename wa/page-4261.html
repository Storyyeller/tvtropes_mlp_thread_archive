            Serperior is calling censorship,  but aside from that people seem relatively cautiously balanced about it.

            Like I said,  I'm not mad about the change. I get it,  and I like the new voice. I just don't like how the fandom is reacting. But it's a fair point that this's probably just the initial fallout from the people who care too much anyways.
<p></p>The one thing I noticed is that RD's voice sounded very <em>different</em> in the new dub. Almost like it's someone doing an imitation of Ball,  and not Ball herself. Anyone else notice that?

            That's a different kind of moral though.   When you respect your elders it's more out a sense of respect for their history.  Respecting the disabled is about not letting someone's differences affect how you treat them.

            and I really don't see anyone in this thread getting all THAT mad,  most of the angry posts are about people being angry about other people being angry to which I say,  CALM DOWN,  right now it's just an initial venting,  something like this you CANNOT go by the first few hours,  of course THAT"S going to be a bit nuts,  give it a few days to settle and maybe get clarification on and see where it goes.

            I think the Granny Smith example was more a "Wisdom of the Elders" moral and not so much of a "People with disabilities are still people" type episode.
<p></p>Similar but not exactly the same.  Youre right that it might be too soon but perhaps if there are more than 13 episodes in S3 .. maybe in the second half of that season.
<p></p>Maybe they could have worked in a "Derpy has to wear an eyepatch or goofy glasses to fix her lazy eye"  I know there are plenty of kids going through that sort of thing and showing them theres nothing wrong with that would be a good thing.

            and checking the EQD comments,  even those seem to be claming down,  far far more people either being angry and people being angry or being the voice of reason,  so everyone,  it will be ok

            You know,  I seem to remember there being a lot of effort trying to get Ginger to not care so much about what everyone else thinks. Shouldn't the same apply to everyone here? People freaking out,  people freaking out about other people freaking out,  etc.
<p></p>I go into stuff just liking it for whatever reason I want. I don't care what the fanbase thinks,  and I don't care what they say unless I agree. I'm going to continue the love the show because it's good,  and I'm not going to spread blame over how x fanbase ruined it,  or y episode ruined it. Nothing can ruin the show is or was for me. The best you can do is ignore it.
