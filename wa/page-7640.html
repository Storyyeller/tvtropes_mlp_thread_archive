            Really Ginger?  You wouldn't take advantage of her?  You wouldn't at least say "Hey I know this is a little late for this,  but you really <em>were</em> kind of an ass to that donkey"?
<p></p>Yeah I'd probably just hug her too... then see if she can hold a game controller and get her to play some <em>Bubble Bobble</em> with me.

            I'd hug Pinkie too :3 Maybe I'd try to bring her out of my cramped apartment or something. We could totally go out and hang out somewhere,  maybe prank someone.

            @Moe Not while we're in bed together. Calling her out on her bullshit would come a lot later. Remember,  I sometimes hate Pinkie because of the way she's used in the show and portrayed by the fandom. I don't hate her as a person

            Soryy Ginger. Had to pop out quickly. So chapter 8? Okay. Just bear in mind what I said when you read chapter 9. I hope that you'll enjoy most of it. You'll at least see a bit of what the Mean 6 are like there.

            I've noticed that dreams often are about stuff that happened recently in your life. But then sometimes,  it's just random. For example,  yesterday I had a dream about <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildThornberries" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildThornberries">The Wild Thornberries</a> for no apparent reason.

            I remember dreaming about being constantly being chased by zombies in a parking lot. They never seemed to move beyond a shamble,  yet everytime I turned around they were a tiny bit closer.
<p></p>My most reccuring dream though is that I'm watching tv,  then I notice something in the backyard. I walk over and I see a pitbull with human eyes at the end of my backyard staring RIGHT at me. I get freaked out and try to close the curtains but they've magically vanished. I turn back to the dog and it's INSTANTLY in front of the window. It's also suddenly turned into a ventriloquist's dummy in the shape of a pitbull. It holds up a gas can and there's a massive explosion. The fire turns blue and I see mewtwo inside it, ,  writhing in pain.
<p></p>I then wake up. I had that dream every night for about a month a few years ago

            @Devnator:Personally I'm really enjoying it. There's a couple of issues I have with it,  but I'm willing to overlook those. I'm more impressed by how much Ginger enjoys it. (Then again,  it does have good villians.)
<p></p>I get the impression that the author would do better writing original fiction though as he's better at working with <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs">O Cs</a> and worldbuilding than he is with handling the canon characters (not that he does a bad job with the canon characters).
<p></p>EDIT: Creepy. the most common dreams I remember are recurring nightmares as well.

<p></p>I think you're more likely to remember nightmares since you're more likely to wake up in the middle of them.

            Huh.  That reminds me of a dream I had not too long ago where I was chased by a donkey with blood-red eyes.
<p></p>Most of my dreams are too weird to summarize,  but one recurring element is that they end up taking place in my grandmother's house (said grandmother died three years ago,  but my family used to basically live with her so I spent a lot of time there).
<p></p>But I've been trying to direct my subconscious to focus on Ponies.  To that end...

<p></p>I've got <em>a little game</em> for you all:
<p></p>Imagine you're making you're own season of MLP.  It can be either 13 or 26 episodes long.  The challenge is you have to come up with a <em>title and a summary</em> for every episode in the season.
<p></p>Who thinks they can do it?  Post your results!
<p></p>I've got one but I'm not satisfied with all of mine yet,  so I'll wait and see if there's any challengers.

<p></p>Well I've never dreamed about entering another dream,  but I did once have a dream,  where I was dreaming and then woke up,  only to discover that I was still dreaming twice.

            I made an edit.
<p></p>Also,  Ginger,  yeah,  I think that he handles Applejack fairly well. He exagerates Pinkie a bit too much and I understand your annoyance at the fact that he makes Twilight so powerful (though I understand that) but her personality is about right. Applejack's role on the team is rather well done and her personality is close to canon,  but I think slightly off. Rarity's pretty good. Fluttershy is a little indecism which makes sense but her personality wavers a bit too much. Rainbow's mostly good but some of her reactions I'm not sure about. Mostly it's excellent,  but a couple of very minor issues makes me think that it would be slightly smoother if he used <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs">O Cs</a> rather than canon characters.
<p></p>EDIT: Well,  most of my issues are here. There's also a little too much dependancy on the Law of Narrativium at some points and Discordia can be a little too <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a> for me to understand why she commands so much loyalty,  but none of those are big things. Just small issues that I'd nitpick if I was asked why it wasn't my favourite fanfic.

            Have you ever dreamed about obtaining something that you want in real life?

<p></p>I was always able to suss out that I was in a dream though (because things would be going TOO perfect) That was always depressing to realize <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">
