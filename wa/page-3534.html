            The moral was <em>delivered</em> weirdly in Luna Eclipsed,  but I think the moral itself works. It's a moral <em>about</em> Luna (or people like her),  rather than anything Luna herself had to learn.
<p></p>Personally,  I am not of the opinion that anyone but Pinkie was "faking" being scared.

            They weren't faking,  it was pretty clear to me they were pretty terrified and Pinkie was doing her derndest to make things worse.

            Personally,  I found it strange that they even had such a holiday yet no one was capable of recognizing Nightmare Moon in the first episode apart from Twilight. And even she had barely heard of the legend.
<p></p>Luna herself makes up for the flaws in the premise and execution,  though.

<p></p>I've never been more annoyed with Pinkie than I was in <em>Luna Eclipsed.</em>  I wanted to confiscate her precious candy and send her to her room.
<p></p>Now,  why do you hate Saturdays?  More questions on your blog?  Trying to catch up to this thread?

            I thought that Pinkie's train of thought was something like "Oh man,  Luna's got the best "costume" <em>ever!</em> And she's totally got the "voice of command" thing down pat! How can I help her routine? Oh! I know!" *panic* "Awesome. This is gonna be the best Nightmare Night ever!"
<p></p>And yeah,  the others weren't faking. Since she seemed to scare them so much without intending to (after the <em>parade in her honor</em> a while back? What?) Luna basically had to figure out a way to play up the whole "scary" angle in a way that screamed "totally playing along with it",  rather than "Ungrateful WHELPS!",  so that they could be more comfortable with getting close to her and knowing the real her.

            Wait,  I conflated the moral with how Twilight got there. Anyway,  I do have some problems with "children like being scared" being the only conundrum they had to solve considering that the adult population are genuinely scared,  but the letter to Celestia works in that context.
<p></p>Actually there Is one other episode whose moral seriously raised my eyebrow but I can't remember which one right now.

            @Syd,  no,  I work at a cinema and as an introvert I am mentally drained by over-stimulation by large numbers of people. The standing for 7.5 hours without break didn't help either.
<p></p>I had a great morning chatting with everyone and watching arguably one of the best episodes of season two next to Lesson Zero,  and then people saturation. I think people are trying to get their movie on before that football thing going on on Sunday or something.
<p></p>I'm not worried about questions anymore,  I'll answer them at my own pace which is still rather swift,  I simply need fun and the latest Rainbow Dash presents looks good enough. The satire it had on Equestria Daily it had in the beginning I found to be quite apt. Calling it "Trixie Variety Show" was the perfect name for it.

            I know a lot has probably been said about this episode,  but I really liked the subtle misdirection with the mental patient near the end. It was only halfway through the chase that I noticed that they didn't have a dog with them.
<p></p>And if you look closely you can see a silhouette of her during the chase.

Sounds like the same problem as that pirate version of Feathermay I once saw!  Well,  I guess her wings could have been hacked off in battle; that's some real pirate action there.

            I daresay Rainbow Dash would make for a decent story-reader,  at least for an action-adventure series like Derring-Do's adventures. She has the voice for it.
