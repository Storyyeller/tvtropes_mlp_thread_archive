Either way,  he doesn't really count as a "Hearts and Hooves Day" reference,  since he first appeared in "The Mysterious Mare Do Well" and has been in the opening since "Lesson Zero".
<p></p>As for Manehattan Snowglobe Derpy,  don't forget that this is a universe with unicorn magic. That probably wasn't actually a real pony in there.

<p></p>Also,  acordding to Seth of EQD "I mean,  everypony loves Pinkie. Anyone who doesn't is probably an ass. (Ha,  foreshadowing and a donkey joke! I'm full of comedy gold today!) No,  I don't think you're an ass if you don't like Pinkie... but you're probably confused,  because repeatedly breaking the fourth wall is pretty awesome.)". it's a joke but still seemed funny to me

            I was thinking,  "What is it about Pinkie that ended up endearing her to Cranky?"  And then I realized that it's probably her persistence in trying to give her apology to him.  He was very persistent himself in traveling all over Equestria for his lost love,  so perhaps he ended up respecting that she had that trait as well.  Also,  I suppose the fact that she gave him what he had been searching for would also be a major factor in him deciding he at least sort of likes her.  It is rather odd to me that he suddenly said they were "friends, " however,  given the enormous amount of ponies who Pinkie considers to be her "friends, " it may just be more what the average person would consider to be a friendly acquaintance.  Pinkie MAY be the type who considers anyone who isn't outright hostile towards her to be her friend,  and thus she has a much broader definition of who could count as a "friend" to her than I would,  as an introvert myself.  Still not sure Pinkie and I would get along very well in real life,  although I do share her love of singing and goofy randomness.  Applejack,  Twilight and Fluttershy would probably get along best with me of all the ponies,  and Rainbow Dash the least (braggart jocks and I do NOT get along at all).
<p></p>I'm also very pleased with all the continuity they're acknowledging from previous episodes,  including what was stated in the very first episode ever.  If I remember correctly,  it was in the very first story that Pinkie said that she knew everyone in Ponyville,  so that being mentioned in this latest story would be yet another example of consistent continuity in the series.

            Id like Pinkie if she were all about fun and games and partying and less about being a socially awkward borderline psychopath.
<p></p>Imagine if a person came up to you acting like her... then proceeded to do what she did to Cranky...  you'd be calling the police right?
