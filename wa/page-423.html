            Since friendship is magic,  that technically makes Twilight's element friendship.  So then the opposite might be solitude.  I took that interpretation in writing the narration for the comic pages I've been doing (although alternate dimension Twilight technically didn't get her element in that continuity either,  since I didn't give her a crown).  But I basically had her seek personal power at any cost.
<p></p>I also finished colouring my friend's OC pony,  which can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://no-contest-creations.com/2011/07/15/request-ariel/">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.  Pitch black coats cause so many problems (I went with a really dark grey on <a class="urllink" href="http://no-contest-creations.com/mlpfim-self-ponification/">my pony<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> so I could still use the pitch black for outlining and the like,  although it's still a little hard to see).

            ...that doesn't sound right.  The title,  "Friendship is Magic",  is using "magic" as an adjective.  Technically,  it should read "Friendship is Magic<em>al</em>",  but it doesn't.

            <div class="quoteblock">2: An episode where everyone's minds are switched. For the mane 6,  it could be based on which of the ponies are each others opposite. Fluttershy switches with Rainbow Dash,  Pinkie switches with Applejack,  and Twilight switches with Rarity </div>
<p></p>But Rarity is Applejack's opposite,  and Pinkie Pie Twilight's.
<p></p>Also,  I think it would be absolutely crucial to switch up Rainbow Dash with one of the earth ponies or unicorns. It would be far more interesting to see how she would do without wings. By the same virtue,  Twilight should switch with one of the earth ponies or pegasi so we could see her without magic - unless of course it was necessary for her to be able to fix everything with a spell.

            <div class="quoteblock"> What I'm thinking is,  in episode 23,  during Twilight's flashback,  she goes all glowy-eyed and it looks like she might not snap out of it until Celestia intervenes.
<p></p>So what if she didn't? A perverted Element of Magic could be a Reality Warper with Power Incontinence,  exactly like what Twilight almost was. </div>
Yeah,  see,  this is how I would tie everything together in the "mirror universe": Have all the personality shifts stem from Princess Celestia actually being a cruel tyrant.  And it's really easy to come up with twisted versions of the main 6 because this show's not afraid to let them all hit rock bottom a couple of times,  meaning you just have to imagine they have mental breakdowns and reach their lowest points but then <em>stay there</em>,  as no one cultivated a friendship to pull them out of it.  So maybe Twilight Sparkle never got into Evil Celestia's good graces,  and now Twilight's a paranoid recluse who abuses her magic powers to get others to do what she wants,  whose plans never make sense,  and who comes up with wild ideas about her enemies coming to get her.  (Maybe the library isn't really hers to live in in this timeline,  but she does anyway because who can stop her?!)  Pinkie Pie would be the other crazy recluse,  perhaps sitting around in a messy,  forgotten room of the Sugarcube Corner all day,  with no friends at all because she can't help scaring everyone she meets with her disheveled appearance and random,  despairing laughter.
<p></p>Then you could have Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash as the ruthless enforcers of the regime,  with Rainbow Dash getting a thrill out of hunting down suspected rebels and doling out painful amounts of lightning,  and Fluttershy only using her "motherly" shtick as a pretense to abuse the young and the small for not living up to some spartan standards.  You could have a scene where she shames the Cutie Mark Crusaders for not having earned their marks yet!
<p></p>Applejack and Rarity would then be the status-seekers who no longer enjoy working hard and use their connections to reach positions where they can have everything done for them.  Because farm work is hard,  especially now that the princess is extending daylight hours yet again,  so Applejack might as well be the one working the workers,  preferably from a cushy office!  It would be great,  too,  if this Rarity had married Prince Blueblood and now devotes her time to buying more and more pretty things to make herself look good,  totally shunning the common pony.
<p></p>The really great thing is that the "bad guys" might have turned out more humble because of this too.  I once had this idea that Trixie's history was similar to Rainbow Dash's: She went to a magic school for a while,  but got kicked out for her showboating and bullying.  So in the mirror world,  Trixie could have wanted to put on a good,  clean show,  but flunked out of magic school because no one saw how that kind of magic would benefit the defense of Equestria.  Whereas Twilight Sparkle is now the bully,  but she's also the real deal in terms of powerful magic,  and she sees herself as being in competition with Princess Celestia.  I think that would help viewers appreciate what a difference a kind and just leader makes.

            I like the sound of that 'undercover Celestia' episode,  though I think the mane cast has already loosened up a bit with the Princess after the Gala.
<p></p>As for the mirror-universe ponies,  I'm not actually sure they <em>are</em> using 'magic' as an adjective.  There are a lot of instances,  including the pilot episode,  where friendship is literally a form of magic... so a completely antisocial Twilight,  one who is absolutely uninterested in making friends at all - since regular Twilight was interested underneath her initial disdain - would seem like the anti-Element of Magic to me.  And we'd need Pinkamina to be the anti-Element of Laughter.

Yeah,  that's why I'm leaning more towards "undercover Luna" now.  I even thought of a way to tie it into Trixie's return.  See,  my idea was that Trixie would "learn her lesson" that if she really wants to humiliate other ponies,  she needs to do lots of research so that she can "debunk" all their achievements.  So Trixie sets up a "Secrets Revealed" show in which she demonstrates how she believes the "Nightmare Moon Hoax" was pulled off,  driving Twilight and friends bonkers,  when suddenly a certain masked unicorn shows up to challenge Trixie to a duel...

Yeah,  but there's still room to improve their relationship,  if we're to assume that the episodes where Celestia has appeared are the only times they interact with her. It'd be a really interesting episode,  as it would flesh out and give more insight into Celestia's character (as well as make her more of an interesting character),  strengthen her relationship with the mane 6,  and further subverts the idea that all <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal">princesses are proper,  pretty and polite</a> every second of the day,  which Celestia's character has already done in small doses

<p></p>I always thought that Trixie's return would have her losing it and growing more and more unstable over her one definitive failure. She just wouldn't be able to get over that one black spot on her career. then she'd try to steal something that could make her more powerful than Twilight,  and let her ego run out of control once she got it. She would go back to the people who humiliated her and try to have her revenge. Course this would only work if they were planning to make Trixie irredeemable because I don't know how she could reform from that. Rainbow Dash for one would be pissed and it'd be nice to hear a line like: "I told you I should've gone after her."
<p></p>btw I always had the idea that unicorns who misuse magic would have their horns removed,  seeing that sentence being handed out to Trixie from Celestia could be potentially gut-wrenching

<p></p>One more level of creepiness on top of that: What if at the end of the episode Celestia came along and just told her guards to restrain Trixie's head,  then apparated an Ax out of nowhere without even telling the Mane cast what she was going to do

            ^^^^That's my point.  Nightmare Moon attempted genocide and she was only banished,  though that could definitely be because Celestia knew Luna was still rescuable and didn't want to kill her younger sister.  I'm also wondering where people are getting this 'Trixie comes back as a fledgling mass murderer' vibe,  too,  because that's the only thing I can think of bad enough to merit mutilation - in some dark and twisted Equestria that practices it.

Becoming more and more unhinged as she went,  and starting to simultaneously doubt herself AND glorify herself even more. Conflicting emotions brought on by her humiliation could drive her to violence. If she started stealing items of great power and used them to terrorize the mane cast JUST to affirm in her own mind that she is the best. I'd say it's better if she doesn't have magic at all
