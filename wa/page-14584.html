            I've had girls being envious of my hair and nails.
<p></p>Some have described it as a rich brown with blonde streaks. Anyway,  I need a cut every 3-and-a-half weeks or it starts getting shaggy in a month.
<p></p>Same with nails,  I need them trimmed every two weeks.

            I still like the idea of 'the bearded' being an ironic title. But that's a lot less likely since he's been confirmed as male.

            Well considering that very few stallions seem to have beards,  growing a beard may be difficult. So,  if Star Swirl had a mighty beard,  that might be a big deal for ponies.
<p></p>Conclusion? Star Swirl either: A) Made a spell that enhanced beard growing,  or B) Traveled forward in time,  took a page from Fluttershy's book,  and used beard extensions.
<p></p>If it's the latter,  Twi would be crushed.

Who did you hear about this from? Is it possible they were using a different definition of <em>beard</em>?
