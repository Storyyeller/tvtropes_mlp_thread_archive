            Could've formed some kind of partnership,  even. Rarity marks the dig sites,  Spike and the Diamond Dogs collect the gems,  they split the goods 50-50 (or something like that),  everyone goes home with a lot of gems.

Maybe they were just stupid. and wait,  Twilight uses a spell to locate the area of the mines which has the highest concentration of gems right? and figures that the dogs would've taken her down that way,  but wouldn't Rarity have had the dogs dig up all those gems,  and if she didn't,  how would the dogs have known to take her down that way if they NEED her powers to find gems?

I assume they were capable of finding gems before Rarity showed up,  she just makes it way faster.

            For some reason I thought that Rarity was trying to make the cave collapse on the dogs,  when she was marking X's on what looked to be Support pillars. I thought she was just complaining to disguie what she was doing XD

            So I felt like dumping this list of my <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a> plot ideas onto this thread for no reason other than the fact that I want attention and to talk about them
<p></p>1: This idea I heard might actually be one of the plots to one of the S2 episodes (though it was never confirmed): For some reason or another,  Princess Celestia has to disguise and act like a normal pony for a day. So using magic,  she forms herself into a regular looking pony and joins Twilight's group of friends. At first,  the mane 6 are incredibly overwhelmed by her being with them,  but slowly but surely,  Celestia reveals that she's very casual and not very royal when not in public
<p></p>(The following are 2 underdeveloped stock episode plots that I think might fit the style of the show)
<p></p>2: An episode where everyone's minds are switched. For the mane 6,  it could be based on which of the ponies are each others opposite. Fluttershy switches with Rainbow Dash,  Pinkie switches with Applejack,  and Twilight switches with Rarity
<p></p>3: An episode where the mane 6 meet evil "mirrored" versions of themselves,  maybe based off of the Elements of Harmony: an Applejack that constantly lies and cheats and is lazy (Deceit),  a Fluttershy that is rude and mean to everyone (cruelty),  a Pinkie Pie that shows no emotion and/or is always depressed (despair),  a Rarity who wants everything for herself and doesn't care who she takes it from or how (greed),  and a Rainbow Dash that is always abandoning someone or leaving them behind (aversion) (that last one's kind of lame,  but it's difficult to reverse the element of loyalty)

            Other opposites for loyalty could be treachery (in this case caring for oneself over others,  I think) or solitude.

            I favor the twisted versions of the elements,  truth put to bad use,  or excessive love,  or whatever.
<p></p>Twilight is the hardest to reverse though,  perhaps an intensive focus on knowledge.

            Twilight's defining trait is Intelligence,  I think,  not Magic. Magic is just one of its expressions.
<p></p>I think Twilight's evil twin would be a vapid,  superficial frat girl with no interest in learning. Combine the worst traits of Rarity,  Pinkie,  and Gilda into one person; that's Evil Twilight.

Most of them actually aren't at all defined by their elements,  so if you're looking for inversions of their personalities,  you should drop the considerations of elements - Applejack's personality is more prominently rooted in the fact that she works hard at everything,  Rarity is better placed as an artist and creator than a,  er,  philponyist,  Rainbow Dash is all about her outgoing,  competitive nature... thus an evil Applejack would be one who takes shortcuts and cuts corners,  an evil Rarity would be out to destroy the work of others,  and an evil Rainbow Dash would be... well,  a lot like Rainbow Dash in episode 13.  That is to say,  still competitive,  but more concerned with winning at any cost than with actually earning her victory.

It's also easier to think of an excuse for in universe,  since they're a vaguely magical thing and can possibly be messed around with easier than entire personalities

            If you're just looking at the Elements,  then an inverted Rainbow Dash,  an embodiment of disloyalty,  would be a backstabber.  Abandoning people isn't really much of a character trait.  Pretending to be loyal while outright using people is.  Twilight's would be... er,  anti-magic?  Maybe sort of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingWasteland" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingWasteland">Walking Wasteland</a> deal?
<p></p>EDIT: Wait,  let's consider what Twilight said about magic.  "REAL magic comes from within."  What would an inversion of that be?  It's... drawing something in... to...
<p></p>...
<p></p>...dammit,  evil Twilight is a vampire.

            Maybe it could be about Twilight fixing the problem because it was her that caused it in the first place? I can't imagine how any of the other ponies would be able to solve a magical based problem anyway. Or cause it,  for that matter (unless it was come kind of intentional thing by a villain or something)

            What I'm thinking is,  in episode 23,  during Twilight's flashback,  she goes all glowy-eyed and it looks like she might not snap out of it until Celestia intervenes.
<p></p>So what if she <em>didn't</em>?  A perverted Element of Magic could be a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a>,  exactly like what Twilight almost was.
