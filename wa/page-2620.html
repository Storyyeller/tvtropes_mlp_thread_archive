            I'm not inventing an issue,  I seriously have a problem with the idea that there's something that will never change. At that point,  how much of their personality is <em>real</em>? How much of it is just predetermined? Does anything they do have meaning at that point,  or are they little better than animals with strange instincts?
<p></p>Maybe it is a matter of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue and Orange Morality</a>,  but this legitimately bothers me. It's one thing if their passion just happens not to change. But if it <em>can't</em> change? then what's the point of even having it? It's no longer them,  it's some almighty force's twisted game.

It's <em>impossible</em> for them to get a CM that they aren't contented with.  Whether or not they can or can't change it doesn't matter because they're never going to want to.

Like Fluttershy's issues in "The Best Night Ever",  RD's breakdown in "Sonic Rainboom",  etc.  Basically the idea is that when a pony fails in utilizing they're special talent they suffer a brief identity crisis.

            @Ginger: I agree.  I get the feeling that if ponies learned that humans don't have cutie marks,  they'd probably wonder how the heck we manage to function despite not knowing what we're supposed to be doing.  You know,  a sort of "But if you don't have a CM you don't even know who you are!" kind of reaction.

            But the language used seems to imply that a CM is predetermined. Oh sure,  they're <em>happy</em> with it,  but it's all they know. Does that make it right?
<p></p>The idea that there will <em>never</em> be anything that can change it just... bothers me. Yes,  our thoughts are based on chemicals,  but we can still alter and determine the basic way in which those chemicals act. With effort we can consciously change our brain structure. If they can't how much of their thought really is conscious?

            @CMFIS: It's not from any one episode,  just the observation that most of the snaps we've seen have resulted in some way from the girls being unable to fulfill their passions (and thus their cutie marks).
<p></p>Are we seriously having the 'cutie marks destroy free will' point raised again?  We're not talking about <em>careers</em> or <em>hobbies</em>,  we're talking <em>callings</em> here.  Think of every person who's been with a company for their entire lives,  or every person who's gone into the clergy or other religious service,  or anyone else who you could imagine using the phrase "my life's work" unironically.  Do they sometimes get worried that they picked the wrong path,  or maybe that what they're doing isn't right for them?  I'm sure they do.  But at the end of the day,  after the worry fades,  their passion for what they do brings them back to it.  That's the kind of constant we're talking about.
<p></p>If I may construct another silly metaphor,  it's like getting married if you started glowing when you kissed your true love.
<p></p>^It could still change; if Cheerilee decided she wanted to be a gardener,  for instance,  her mark suddenly represents her love of flowers.  The marks are inherently meaningless without the perspective of their owner,  and only their owner can really say what a mark means to them.
<p></p>Also,  let's not go too far with 'Equestria is only happy because of magic brain slavery' there,  keg.

            @Kegisak: But it's <em>not</em> all they know.  There's nothing to stop them from trying new things and then reinterpreting their cutie marks to fit it.  Like Cheerilee could totally become a gardener or an author or something and reinterpret her cutie mark to fit it.
<p></p>EDIT: Dangit Red,  not only did you say what I was going for,  but you even used the same pony as an example.

            @kegi Well how do we know that WE'RE right? "Everything can change" is all we've known. All we can do is act based upon what <em>our</em> world percieves as the norm.
<p></p>People in Equestria are happy. EVERYTHING about them barring that mark (which in and of itself is vague and open to interpretation) can chage,  and <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMs">C Ms</a> lead to their own host of issues (like CMFIS)

            ^^^Probably not.  In my opinion,  it's not so much going contrary to the cutie mark as it is going completely against the pony's personality that causes them to get upset.  It's very intertwined; Fluttershy starts getting upset because the animals don't like her,  not because her cutie mark is being good with animals and she can't do it.

            @Red Savant: You can't deny it's related though.  Fluttershy's special talent is handling animals,  and she broke down because it didn't happen.  Granted there's more context to it than that,  and I doubt that CMFIS is <em>canon</em>,  but I think the basic idea that ponies have identity crises when it looks like they're skill isn't manifesting is sound.
<p></p>@Kegisak: I don't think anybody here <em>is</em> saying that.  All I'm saying when I mean that there's some aspect of their personality that doesn't change is that there's some common thread that works it's way through their lives,  and those things are vague enough that there's plenty of wiggle rooms since the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMs">C Ms</a> are all up for interpretation by the pony in question anyway.

I simply prefer to think of it as being something changeable,  thinking that the mark can change,  rather than some absolute constant.
