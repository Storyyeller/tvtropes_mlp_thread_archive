            Eh,  depending on how closely one looks at the 'cutie marks as puberty' allegory(Which when you think about it really makes no sense... it's more like Apple Bloom is having a seriously early Quarter-Life Crisis) 13 is REALLY late. Like,  distressingly late. 10 or 11 would be my guess,  assuming I remember health class correctly.

            Which is what I figure. She's 11 and a half to 12 in Call of the Cuty and ages from there being 14  by the time of One Bad Apple. Though I head canon her as the oldest in the group with the others trailing a few months behind.

            Surely it's only a year? During course of the show Pinkie Pie and Twilight have had birthdays and no-pony has had more than one,  also the Cake Babies are still the same age in S3 as they were in S2 - there's a timeskip of like... a month between the babies being born and Pinkie babysitting right?
<p></p>I'ld say 1.5 years fits the series better,  enough time for Twilght to have settled when the alicorning happens.

            Two at least,  season 1 covers summer,  fall,  and spring so the first season alone is around a year. Besides,  Winter Wrapup to Heart's Warming Eve is a year from winter to winter. Not to mention there's a summer festivel in One Bad Apple.

            Ya know what? I'm getting real bored with me not having an Avatar when I'm on this thread so why not? I'll take you guys up on the search for an Avatar thing. And plus it'll distinguish me from the rest I guess.

            <em>Two at least,  season 1 covers summer,  fall,  and spring so the first season alone is around a year.</em>
<p></p>Considering that Winter Wrap up is episode 11 and Fall Weather Friends is episode 13,  I'm not sure how closely we can really hold the world's chronology to its seasonal changes,  unless we accept that like half a year passed with absolutely nothing episode-worthy happening but the formation of the Cutie Mark Crusaders.

            Well,  why do we assume episode order means chronological? I take it that season 1 is pure anacronic order over a year. It's easier if you stack up the time markers in season 1 in American holiday order and go from there.
