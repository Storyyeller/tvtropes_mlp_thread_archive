            Hey keg,  if the idea you have for the Four Kings doesn't pan out into canon,  why not just add a 'seventeenth' book in that,  in-universe,  was written by a fan who thought that the sixteen canon books had set up a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> that just was never addressed?

            Well,  given the nature of the final book,  I think it makes sense to have everything culminate here.  What with the eldritch horror thing going on (so is probably SHOULD require a ton of artifacts) and its status as doorstopper would allow ample writing space for all the loose ends to be tied up.

            My own art style is highly anime influenced,  I wouldn't just out and out disregard the style,  it's when no one evolves from it is when I get annoyed. The person who did that other pic did fine,  had a sort of Wakfu sort of look to it,  it's.... nice.

            @Seraph: My idea at the times was that each of the four kings (ie one king for earth ponies,  pegasi,  unicorns and sea ponies) would each get at least one weapon and one 'lesser' artifact. Like,  The trident was the sea pony weapon and the goblet was their lesser artifact. The staff of Starswirl was the unicorn weapon and the Crown was their lesser artifact. Each of them in the original thought would also have a special region - like the Cove of candles was my idea for the sea pony region,  the mountain in the yeti's curse the pegasi's,  the garden's of equestria's the earth pony's,  etc. Trick is I don't know <em>exactly</em> what the artifacts are,  so I can't peg them all.
<p></p>@Red: Possible... but to be honest I don't want to push for anything too solid,  in part because I'm taking really heavily from <em>The Colour You Bleed</em> canon for it. The four Kings would relate <em>really</em> heavily to an idea I had for a possible overarching plot,  Blueblood would have to go all over the continent (and even outside of it,  to places where the world basically went non-euclidian as a result of an ancient magical war) picking up a representative of each race to sort of replace the original four kings and go up against an old god - as in,  a Discord style creature that was responsible to creating one of the elements of reality. Possibly time,  but might be something else. SO I kinda don't want to feel like I'm pushing the four kings angle <em>too</em> hard,  even though it wouldn't be directly related to that.

            I like that Idea Kegi. Only addition I'd make is adding something tied directly to NMM as well,  which would come from Alicorn's Shadow. As well as my idea that the true end treasure in Unity is something connected to both Royal Sisters,  with the Trials and the last fake artifact that acts as a trap being made so that only both Sisters together can access it.

            Aheh... thanks,  guys. Kind of a shame it's only fanfiction... Still,  Thinking about it it's not <em>that</em> hard to re-purpose it all as an actual novel. And yeah,  it's related to the old souls idea - Basically there are two kinds of gods; old souls and old gods. The old gods are figures like Discord,  who are related to an element of reality,  ie. chaos,  harmony,  time etc. Old souls are figures like Celestia and Luna. The four kings were the first old souls,  and the first of their respective tribes. After they died for the first time the tribes went to war,  nearly destroying the planet with their magic. Then the spirits of the four kings came back,  told them to cut that shit out and physically bound themselves to the planet to keep it from falling apart. I had a cool idea for a scene where Blueblood actually has a conversation with Noble,  the first kind of the unicorns - who at that point is basically the living flow of magic.
<p></p>@Mousa: That... is awesome.
<p></p>@Applelight: Well,  not that he'd really appreciate it...
