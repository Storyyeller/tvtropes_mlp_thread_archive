            from about a billion pages back (last time I was here,  anyway):
<div class="quoteblock">Harry Potter And The Methods Of Rationality which is extremely author tracty including altering canon for the purpose of author tracts,  the author hasn't bothered to read all the canon books,  he has some very stupid approaches to plot and characterisation and his views are stupid.
<p></p>I haven't read his work yet,  but I get this mostly from his words and praises that people heap on him. </div>
<p></p>I recall once reading a selection where Dumbledore criticized the logic of <em>Lord of the Rings.</em>  IIRC he said something about how Gandalf should have just kidnapped Frodo and taken him to Rivendell and said eff all to any morals or civility he may have had.
<p></p>According to the Trope Page,  Dumbledore is supposed to come off as kind of crazy,  but the piece taken out-of-context struck me as the author using a character as a mouthpiece for his "rational" reasoning.  In general I take no stock in rationality,  because it's often <em>less</em> rational (and less practical) than whatever it is the rest of us do.
<p></p>I mean,  if I see a Chupacabra,  and you try to go all Occam's Razor on me,  I'm gonna say "shut the fâ€”- up.  It was a Chupacabra.  I'm pretty sure I know the difference between a humanoid lizard goat-sucker with big red eyes and any possible natural animal you're claiming I mistook it for."
<p></p>... So what's all this about Pinkie being put on trial?

            yeah the way they did it in FOE was great,  they din't change them or invert them,  they just showed how even a virtue can be truned bad if it's taken to far and not balanced.
<p></p>Blind loyalty to nothing mroe then the contract,  regardless of what it requires you to do.
<p></p>Forcing laughter to try and hide you fear and pain by putting up a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Stepford Smiler</a> front,  instead of letting the laughter come naturally to lift you up out of the depression.
<p></p>Honesty taken to part of getting yourself killed rather then just shut up.
<p></p>'Generously" forcing what you think is best for ponies on them no matter what it takes.
<p></p>etc... yeah that was REALLY well done.

            <em>IIRC he said something about how Gandalf should have just kidnapped Frodo and taken him to Rivendell and said eff all to any morals or civility he may have had. </em>
<p></p>no,  the arguemnet was that as soon as gandalf even suspected the ring was The One Ring he should have goten Frodo to safety,  not kidnap him,  just get him moving just like he ended up doing,  only sooner. THEN confirm his findings,  instead of waiting till he was sure he wasn't mistaken. That way if hew's right the ring is already relativly safe,  and if he's wrong then all he's done is inconvenienced Frodo...who would have been fine anyway since he lways intened to travel and see Rivendale eventually anyway...and made himself look a bit paranoid.
<p></p>but again,  much like with a lot of poeple's critisms of FOE backstory,  hindsight's 20/20 and it's easy to judge a character as stupid when you have information they had no way of knowing.

            ok that came out bad. the arguement was that the only reason gandalf waited to confirm it WAS The <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneRing" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneRing">One Ring</a> was he was scared of looking like a fool if it turned out it wasn't. Dumbledore said Gandalf should have just taken the risk of looking foolish rather then potentially leave the One unguarded. He din't say he should have done anything cannon gandlaf didn't,  jus that he shouldn't have waited to make sure he wasn't making a mistake.

            well the rant wasn't the spell itself,  just at how stupid it was for a student to use a random spell,  ANY spell,  on someone when they had no idea what it did . Which is a good point.
<p></p>also it was Quirrel that did the rant.
