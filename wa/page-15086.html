            Was the Pinkie microcomic officially released,  or was it a leak? because the main series was only out last week,  and usually they stagger them.

<p></p>...Pinkie seems to have taken a leaf from the Inconvenient Trixie tumblr.  <em>Despite probably being drawn several weeks before it was.</em>  Which,  really,  is a very Pinkie thing to do.
<p></p>The clown has a box marked "EXPLODING THINGS".  Cue FBI search.
<p></p>Apparently Twilight can play a circus pipe organ.  I can't help but think she's playing this.

<p></p>Come to think of it,  the comics are basically a G-rated hitman's anthology.

            Never accidentally deleted,  but I've had my computer overheat and abruptly shut down during a project because I forgot the intake gets blocked when it sits on my bed.
<p></p>Thankfully it had periodic autosaving and crash recovery stuff that kicked in when I turned it back on,  so I only lost a few minutes' worth.

            Yeah I know. And I'm always thankful.
<p></p>Just...Be appreciative for what you've got,  it's never the same after you lose a part of your body. Despite my best efforts,  I still hate the world for what it did to me.

            @Seraphim: I know that you're looking for completed FOE fics to liveblog. I don't really know any (I've only read the original and the first few capters of Project Horizons and what Pannic's written),  but if you're willing to go for other postapocalyptic Equestria's,  ho about The Archer and The Smith. It's the first in a verse,  but it's still stand alone.

            Okay. Maybe I'll try that. I do want to try read more Project Horizons sometime though. I read up to where the first "test to see if you can handle this much" is and while it was dark,  I could still handle it at least.

The protagonist is more a concept than a character,  but the approach is neat enough that it's a nice read.

The hard part,  is making this guy look like a relative of Fancy Pants yet being suitably different coloured and younger and fiercer.  His mane and tail are bothering me too.  I don't want him to look like a simple clone of Shinning Armour either.
<p></p>His personality and back story is coming along nicely though.  I have him kidnapped as a kid by pirates,  and he's rescued by a great privateer hero (in the course of which,  Free has to take the helm of the air ship and gets a taste for flying,  hence the CM).  So yeah,  he has a long connection with flying/sailing and adventure etc.  Magic to go with such a CM is tricky to get though.

            I suppose that's an advantage in that I can get relatively cheap transportation within limits via Disability Transit. Hate the name,  but for 3 bits a ride and able to go 40 miles around my area,  I'll take it.
