            I think it's sort of a consequence of the way she's written in the show. They've summed it up pretty well.

            @Purple Dalek: Regarding Ginger,  there also seems to be the fact that in the fanbase at large,  Pinkie seems to be incredibly popular,  which frustrates him a bit because his favorite mane cast pony doesn't get nearly as much attention.
<p></p>But yeah,  it's mostly annoyance at the fact that her "wackiness" lets her get away with stuff that the rest of the cast couldn't pull without getting called out on it.  Since she's "the crazy one" she's held to a different characterization standard than the rest of the ponies.
<p></p>@Edvedd: Normally I'd be sad about that,  but I have so much other crap to do that I'm kinda glad to have a break from the reviews.
<p></p>@Dragon Ranger: That's weird.  Maybe you should go ask about it in the Wiki Talk forum or something.

            Ok,  now  that I am finally on a proper PC I can get this out.
As I said back on <a class="urllink" href="../wa/page-3942.html#post-98534">my previous post<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> I wanted to share my thoughts about <a class="urllink" href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/we-dont-really-post-4chan-news-much.html">the news I read this morning<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  well not the news itself (could careless if it is sincere or a rouse,  time will make that clear) but the comments that were posted below is what stirred my interest and got me to really think or contemplate this fandom some. I think in order to set up what I am about to say I should state how I became a brony myself to put this in context.
<p></p>I had not really been "on" the internet for sometime (being consumed by <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>) but I still checked on some of my favorite sited periodically,  which in Cracked.com where I came across <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-4-most-unexpected-fan-bases-in-pop-culture/">this article<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographics" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographics">Periphery Demographics</a>. After initial readings  of it I was not really drawn to MLPFIM out of curiosity/discuss/interest at all,  what peaked my interest was the entry on Lionel Richie's popularity in the Middle East. So when I looked down to the comments section to see some of the typical funny/stupid remarks on that I was somewhat surprised to see the argument going on about Bronies as I thought mysel that it would get slammed and people would move on but this was different. I had never seen so many people of a "niche group" argue back so ferociously like that. It wasn't like the typical flame war that breaks out there and it seemed to overshadow almost all of the other topics that were discussed there (with the exception of yaoi-ism among middle-age women) and it left me puzzled but I didn't think much and went on to something else.  A round two weeks later I remembered the article and took another look at it out of curiosity,  and people were still commenting on this one group! Now I knew were I would have to go to understand this phenomenon...<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisWiki" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisWiki">This Wiki</a>,  which I have been on for about 4 years this February (although I was basically lurking for the first 2 years,  still need to make a troper page). It blew my fucking mind how detailed and catalogued this show had been; I had came to TV Tropes from an Anime forum and Ihad seen a few Troped out and re-troped pages in my time but it had been a while since I saw something like this. I must have spent at least 2 and a half hours reading everything before <em>finally</em> deciding to watch the first episode and <em>give the show a shot</em>,  of course by then I was a brony and didn't even know it.
<p></p>Sorry for the long post! I will now attempt to put this whole thing in context by sharing my thoughts on the responses to the 4Chan news and the implications I think it may or may not have on the fandom's future as well as what may become of bronism in the future regardless. (I know most will state that this is not a big deal,  or nothing to think much of but...I still wish to share these thoughts somewhere and being a troper I thought of this place first. Also I study a lot on history and philosophy so my view on things are usually long,  detailed,  and some what exisitential(think <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard">Kierkegaard<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> not Nietzsche)) Also since I 'm doing a lot of typing I will not be able to immediately respond to any replies to this post until my follow-up post. Please just bare with me on this friends and I will have it all out of my system by my next post.
