            This might be an odd thing to bring up,  especially coming from a newbie,  but am I the only one who prefers G1's designs when compared to G4's? They just look so much more like horses to me. I still like FIM,  don't get me wrong,  and it greatly improves on the original in almost every single way. It's probably just the nostalgic little girl in me.

<p></p>It's fairly common in Japanese writing. Kanji (the more complicated characters that you see in the image) is technically its own alphabet as well. The more boxy looking characters are katakana,  which is used for loan words (like the pony names). The simple characters are hiragana,  the most basic of Japanese writing. :)
<p></p>Looks like my four years of Japanese in high school have finally become useful...on an internet forum.

            @Applelight - People get old and die (or earlier),  and anyone who seeks to create any creative content goes through failures (unless you are one of those geniuses who can churn out bestsellers in one go,  and you can bet you are not one of them) multiple times. You better get used to it. Learn from it. Then try again. Rince and repeat.

<p></p>At my school we had a teacher who was legendarily strict and scary. When she went out of the room,  some of my classmates would play a game where you run up to the board,  write the word 'Penis' as big as you dare,  then quickly erase it and run back to your seat. Whoever wrote it the biggest won. Amazingly,  noone ever got caught.

<p></p>I don't know what the future holds for MLP. Personally,  I hope that it will be a continuation of the series appealing to children of all genders and ages. I want to be able to watch it with my children and STILL enjoy it.

            @Story: In my school there was a game where,  when the teacher's back was turned,  you would stand on your seat and touch the ceiling with your elbow,  then sit back down before they turned around. I think every school has one of those.

            @Posey: Welcome.  I actually prefer the G4 designs for the exact same reason you mentioned: They're more stylized. The G1 designs are too horse-like for me to find all that cute.  Horses fall more into the "cool" group of animals than the "cute" group.
<p></p>Re: School games: We had a couple of those.  One of them was "Stealth".  We weren't allowed in the hallways during lunch,  so we had a game of who could sneak into the halls and hang around the longest while evading the teachers.  The other one was where we'd take a ball of aluminum foil,  and toss it back and forth in the classroom.  Whoever got the most throws without being caught won.
<p></p>Then there were the tic-tac boxes. Not really a game,  but my class ate a lot of tic-tacs,  and we decided to see how many we could line up on the top of the chalkboard in the back of the room before the teacher caught on.
