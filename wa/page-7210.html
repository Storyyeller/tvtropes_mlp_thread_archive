            Glad you liked it,  and yeah thought you might not like Pinkie,  but hey at least the Doctor stopped and asked "How do you know that? No seriously,  HOW do you know that."
<p></p>Like I said,  sequel is even better,  less Pinkie,  though as I said there is one spot where Twi goes Super Saiyan Mama Bear to protect Spike.
<p></p>So anything else to say? about it?

            I don't really get why the author chose the Carrionites to be the villiains. If you're going to use a DW villain,  use a good one like the Daleks,  Cybermen,  Silents,  Weeping Angels etc.

            Yeah,  I dislike it when the fandom makes Pinkie an all knowing savant who's unphased by almost anything and just KNOWS things inexplicably.
<p></p>Anything else to say? I liked the Carrionites and the Smooze and the plentiful technobabble. Everything felt very in character and it was surprisingly <em>dark</em>
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> Why not? The Carrionites are awesome,  and they allowed the author to pay homage to the G1 movie. (which had three witches trying to summon the Smooze)
