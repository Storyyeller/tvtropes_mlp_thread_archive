Problem is,  I hate that kind of humour unless they're using it against someone who deserves it. Twilight... didn't. Not by a long shot.

            @Fallen Technically Twilight's mane is 3 colours: purple and pink streaks on a purple tinted navy blue.  And Twi does care enough about her appearance to at least fix her bed mane in Bridle Gossip.
<p></p>As for the socks,  well,  it was the ATG theme,  but you should note that I never played the theme completely straight.  I played it for laughs instead of cuteness. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

<p></p>@Gault If it's any consolation,  I believe Lauren Faust herself freaked out a bit when fan concern about the implications of that moral were brought up with her.
<p></p>@Death There's no denying that Pinkie often breaks the 4th wall and engages in some massive <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation">Offscreen Teleportation</a> abuse,  though.  So while fanon tends to exaggerate things as usual,  I have to disagree with you.

<p></p>Why everybody who complain about this episode act as it was only Twilight bashing/abusing in this? Forgeting that she have <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMoA" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMoA">C Mo A</a>  at climax.

Pinkie seemed to be in control for that entire episdode. I've mentioned it before,  but it was mainly that self-fulfilling prophecy that annoyed me. It made it seem like Twilight never had a choice whether or not to accept Pinkie's power,  as it was already fated to happen,  and would occur no matter what.
<p></p>also guys... What do you think is the most rewatchable episode of MLP <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a>?

(sigh) but it felt like they were all fated to beat the Hydra because Pinkie had already predicted that Twilight would accept her. Until that happened,  nothing bad would befall them.

<p></p>First thing,  and this is in no way a defense of the episode,  ginger,  you're mixing up cause and effect.  Things are predicted because they're going to happen,  they don't happen because they were predicted.  Assuming strict linear causality,  it's not necessarily some supernatural "fate" that allows for accurate predictions,  but rather,  to the forces that enable the prediction,  the entire universe behaves in an ordered,  understandable,  completely predictable way,  and this includes how individuals think.
<p></p>That said,  I completely agree that Twilight was punished and made a fool of for simply being <em>rational</em> and trying to <em>understand</em> things,  things that she could simply have dismissed outright and ignored.  And then in her moment of righteous indignation,  she gave up.  Not cool.

            No,  she <em>didn't</em>. She acted scientifically.  She attempted to understand a phenomenon through observation.  She formulated a hypothesis (that Pinkie Sense wasn't real) and attempted to gather data,  but only got hurt.

Just because certain types of magic exist in a fantasy show,  doesn't mean that all have to. It also doesn't mean that certain types of magic are exempt from justification when others are given perfectly reasonable explanations for existing. Unicorn magic seems to be a measurable force that can be studied,  honed,  and directed. "Pinkie Sense"... wasn't.
<p></p>Unicorn magic is much like our science to equestrians. It's a proven force with basis in their world's logic. Being told: "There are something's you just can't explain,  so just accept it." Is one of the most horrible things you can hear as a scientist.

            Regardless of setting and intent,  she used the rational method - the very definition of rational. Not to mention that,  in this setting,  magic is treated as a science.
<p></p>And she doesn't ignore any facts at all. When the evidence points overwhelmingly to the pinkie sense,  she gives in and belives in the pinkie sense. Eve while she was testing it,  the issue wasn't truly that she believed it wasn't happening,  it was that she didn't <em>know</em> what was truly happening. That's why she strapped pinkie in a machine - she was trying to measure the exact details of what happened when one of Pinkie's twitches went off.
<p></p>Think of it like the Turing test. A computer set a against the Turing test will be tested by psychiatrists,  scientists,  and religious figures,  to test if it can reason,  think like a human,  and imitate the 'soul'. The latter of these figures would want nothing less than for a machine to demonstrate the soul. they would likely spend the majority of the testing period fighting the thought for as long as they can. But,  three computers to date have passed the test. That means that,  despite their initial misgivings,  they eventually succumbed to evidence. Twilight did the same. Therefore,  her test was no less rational than one established by scientists in our world.
