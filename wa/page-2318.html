            @Ginger: The main reason I don't see that is because Rarity was doing it for <em>free</em>.  If they were commissioning the dresses,  then yeah,  she should go with their specifications.  But since she was doing it purely because she felt like it,  they were less in a position to complain about it.
<p></p>EDIT: Oh,  Mage is up to FPK?  Well,  let's see how he reacts before starting to argue over the moral again.  I'd rather not have another fight.

            @JT No,  I agree that they were wrong to complain because she was doing it for free. I just don't see the act of them not being satisfied with their dresses as being all that bad.

            I took the moral more as someone who does something for a living knows more about it than you. Which,  working in a creative industry,  is a moral I can appreciate. But then there's no accounting for tastes,  which play a heavy role in Rarity's career as well. So it's a bit of a fine line.
<p></p>Also,  I just thought that you may want to know I just got back from having dinner in a place called the Tea Story. I pretty much was thinking of Tealove on and off the whole time.

It is both ironic and describes what he does. I hope his Cutie Mark is two Juggling Pins,  that's what I've got written down.

            ^Yeah.  Open,  frank dialogue between the creator and the client is the best course of action,  usually,  and definitely in this case.  I kind of got the feeling that Rarity decided not to refuse any of her friends' requests the second time around simply because she felt bad that they didn't like her first dresses.

            Feeling Pinkie Keen is actually one of my favorite season 1 episodes,  even with the "controversy" it seems to be surrounded by. I can't adequately explain why,  but in general,  I just think the episode is hilarious. Mostly because of Twilight.

            I think the main issue is that they made her go to the work of making a second set of dresses when she was already overworked.  Not liking the first set of dresses was okay. It's when they went to "she has to redo everything" that there's a problem.  A middle ground option would have been the best; i.e. they give Rarity advice,  but Rarity holds a sort of veto power,  or at least gets them to think it over.
<p></p>AJ: I want Galoshes
<p></p>Rarity: Galoshes wouldn't fit with the rest of the dress; maybe some yellow slippers.
<p></p>Or something like that.

            @Apple: Oh yeah,  pretty nice. A little hipster for a nice little tea shop,  though. they served sandwiches made of waffles.
<p></p>@Ginger: Oh yeah,  they can still offer stuff - but they shouldn't be pushing in like they know best,  is what I mean. They can offer little bits like "oh,  I want it to look cool",  or "can it be a little less fancy, ",  but they shouldn't be taking over the process. To equate it more to my job I'm fine with someone saying "I don't find this fun because it's a bit too slow",  but I don't like it when someone start listing off mechanics I should be including. Basically I can alter my vision slightly,  but it's still <em>my</em> vision. Similarly these are dresses Rarity was making,  and while she was making them for her friends and wanted to make them happy she shouldn't have given in so easily and compromised her vision just so that they would all be pleased. She should have been able to keep a bit of her original design in there instead of just following instructions.
