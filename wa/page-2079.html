            It must be bad luck for them,  almost everytime Dashie sees them something goes bad for them. Poor Wonderbolts.
<p></p>@kegis: I like to think Twi needs to cast her spells as executable code,  because I like magic that can be broken down into PHYSICS that we haven't learnt yet. You must have the latent ability to understand programming language or something like me,  since I can talk/type like that without actually knowing more than HTML and possibly BML scripts,  although I <em>have</em> played with the rule.ini file in Command &amp; Conquer before.

            The Wonderbolts are ponies that Rainbow Danger Dash looks up to. Considering she can do feats of mythical proportions I'd guess the Wonderbolts must be pretty impressive.

            Good episode,  not great but good.  I love all dragon stuff.
<p></p>Interesting new thing we learned about dragons. I still thing they get grow age normaly with time and that  what hapen in this ep is other way,  more terrifying,  if baby dragon can grow so fast during one day and become greedy monster rest of world must have big problem with dragons.  Good thing that he remain wingless,   so fanon about Spike growing wings is finally jossed.
<p></p>I like that many other character showed up,  Cherilee ,  Zecora,  Wonderbolt (and they do other stuff that Air  Show,  I allways whanted  to them to do more stuff).

            I'm imagining a strange episode where Dashie realizes that she is awesome enough even without joining the Wonderbolts,  yet accepts becoming a honary member gracefully because she still likes them even though her training has finally made her surpass them in ability.
<p></p>@thefran: Pinkie's place at the Sugarcube Corner is spruced up because she insists on it and puts her bits into it. Rarity pimps out her house because it's also her boutique and must look as good as her fashions. Twilight enchanted her treehouse with self-restoration or something,  Dashie can fix her house as she pleases,  AJ's farmhouse is always done up the Traditional Apple Family way (passed down over a thousand years of Apple Family traditions!),  and Fluttershy's cottage is tended by some of her grateful animal friends.

            is there a trope for magic as programming? I think I've seen it elsewhere...
<p></p>but it makes sense. Take the force itself (Data) and focus and change it through various parameters. Subsitute say,  runes for variables,  then at the end you 'package' the rune order,  then just run the magic through it later to cast the spell. At that point magic becomes an issue of learning/writing the speel once and then just having the power to use it...
<p></p>spell.exe. I like it!

<p></p>Don't forget that she was in a dive the whole time,  while they were unconscious and only falling as fast as gravity could take them. Dash was in a proper diving posture,  increasing her acceleration,  and they were conked out in various weird postures that didn't exactly reduce their wind resistance.
<p></p>They weren't falling in a vaccuum; their speed was dependent on friction.
<p></p>And is a dive really the best context in which to judge their <em>flying</em> ability,  anyway? A dive is <em>literally</em> falling with style.
<p></p>Anyway:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I bet it's a bad pointer definition in her casting script,  only the exception handler managed to parse it as usable coordinates and targeting so the spell resolved glitchily. She should really run a debugger enchant or doublecheck her code before casting-compile. </div>
<p></p>Ace,  you have the best spell explanations and I love that I can actually parse that,  due to my programming classes.

            wait,  something's occured to me: Spike was easily the size of other dragons by the end of his growth. But he <em>never grew wings</em>. Does this mean he's really awingless breed,  and not just that he'll grow them later like some people think?

A copyright claimant would only need to do it once. In fact multiple copyright claims <em>of any sort</em> are generally trolls.
<p></p>Speaking for myself,  I'm grabbing the episode to my desktop once the imge quality gets to 720. I <em>could</em> go to 1080,  but 220 takes up about half the space and is still HD.
<p></p>I'm considering setting up a torrent for the season; trolls can't touch us on an FTP.

            @Ginger: It's more a distant future thing. It's also more Dashie realising she was <em>always</em> awesome and realising her dream was merely a stepping stone. Wonderbolts are cool ponies,  mind. I always felt for Dashie's inner fears that she was really a nobody,  and understand that part of her standoffishness and jerkish behavior stems from deep-seated insecurities and hidden self-esteem issues.
<p></p>On the whole spellscript thingie: I just thought it logical that codified Unicorn arcane magic would have been studied thoroughly and decompiled into the basic casting "elements",  which can be defined as a form of programming language. It's like using <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Discworld" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Discworld">HEX</a> to study thousands of spells to reverse-engineer and decompile and whatever so you can cast a better Summon Party Pony spell.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_down.png" alt="[down]" title="[down]" height="16" width="16"> I suspect Spike's growth spurts this episode are a residual from when Twi's magic ran rampant back during her entrance exam.
