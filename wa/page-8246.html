            Bringing up the previous discussion for villains,  anyone think something of a tragic antagonist would be an interesting twist to the show,  sorta like a foe the heroes would regret having to take down?
<p></p>Sorry,  as has been pointed out today,  I'm a big fan of grey morality.

            @ginger: That's a point I like too,  though this is less in a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">Designated Villain</a> case,  more one that we know has to be taken out,  but is sympathetic enough that even the heroes are empathetic about it.
<p></p>I don't like villains that are so relatable and pitiful that they make the heroes bullies,  but that's a different scenario to what I'm thinking.

            I agree with Psi on that topic. Sympathatic villains are some of my favorite kinds of bad guys,  along with the brillaint ones {Especially when they happen to also be a sympathatic villain as well} and the pure evil and vicious ones as well.

            Similar to how I like a Straight Man to have at least one vice,  I like a villain to at the very least have some charismatic charm or redeeming aspect to them,  not to the point he's MORE likeable than the heroes but to the point you can <em>almost</em> get a gist of why they act like they are. Most of the villains in the series are kinda one note nasty,  par maybe Discord,  who,  while still obviously evil,  is <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">Actually Pretty Funny</a> (at least to Pinkie).

            you could try some of the Fire Emblem games,  those usually have decent villains,  and require a lot of planning and thinking to beat even the mooks.

            I like sympathy in the form that what motivates their actions are understandable. What I don't like is when their actions don't match their motive. Like their too far down the redeemable path.

            @ginger  Freespace (space sim) - Shivans.  Both games of series when those guys show up it become hopeless war very fast,  and you as player will see this in many missions.

            Mostly I prefer cartoony villains over serious ones,  though they can still have tragic or sympathetic motives.
<p></p>@Chadaman: I agree I don't like villains that are too redeemable yet treated with a black and white manner by the heroes,  again <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreamstone" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreamstone">The Dreamstone</a> (I know I refer to this show a lot but it did <em>everything</em> wrong in developing hero characters that it frustrates me to no end). Again this is about getting the right chemistry from the heroes and having them need to deal with them in more complex manner.
