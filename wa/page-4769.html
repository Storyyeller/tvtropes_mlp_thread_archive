            @latenight: It's not so much the lack of creativity as it is a huge inaccuracy and the appearance of a lack of awareness of a concept that's much older than the film. Of course I'm just being crotchety about a film I've never seen and it's definitely more memetic than 'recursive x'.

            Alright,  I just managed to catch up on all of the pages since the preview clip came up in one go. Because I am totally the Element of Logic,  it's time to dissect the possible rules of Time Travel here.
<p></p>Here's what we know about the spell:
<p></p><ul><li>The traveler can only stay in the past for a short period of time,  limiting possible interaction.
<p></p></li><li>The spell cannot be easily repeatable,  otherwise you could just come back again later and the time limit would be meaningless.
<p></p></li><li>The spell is moderately destructive to the area around it both on arrival and upon wearing off. This is most likely just <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule Of Cool</a>,  but realistically,  it's a very good reason not to use it to go anywhere/when that you don't know exactly what will be there when you arrive.
</li></ul><p></p>There are also plenty of ways that time travel can be used without being the be-all-end-all solution to a problem:
<p></p><ul><li>As mentioned before <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">StableTimeLoops</a> pretty much prevent paradoxes by having the time travel already be a permanent part of the timeline,  and the timeline is unchangeable.
<p></p></li><li>Time Travel could have <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyEffect" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyEffect">Butterfly Effect</a> style consequences that can either completely erase or severely modify the future at the slightest change in ways that are completely unpredictable except in the most controlled of circumstances.
<p></p></li><li>The time stream is self-correcting,  with probability bending itself to achieve the same outcome regardless of one's actions in the past.
<p></p></li><li>Time Travel doesn't put you into the past,  but instead puts you into a parallel timeline,  so any changes made there don't affect your own timeline.
</li></ul><p></p>I really do love Time Travel,  especially when the characters themselves don't know exactly how it works either and have to figure things out via trial and error. Since Twilight didn't even know it was possible until her future self informed her,  it seems to be leaning toward <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> or Parallel Timelines at this point. Of course,  maybe they'll get really creative. I hope they do.

            When it comes to time travel-afflicted stories,  the biggest gamechanger of all is not Historical Inperative or Narrativium or those annoying Quantum Butterflies,  it's the choices of people. History can try to drag a timeline back into course kicking and screaming all the way,  but a well placed stone on the track of time can derail the course of history - and our choices can become those stones.
<p></p>Of course,  since Twi is probably gonna react predictably,  it'll be a clear-cut case of stable timelooping,  I guess.

            Thinking about the apparent time limit on traveling also made me think of a more elegant solution to the time travel problem. What if the amount of time you can spend in the past is inversely proportional to how far you went back? Go back a few hours and you might be able to stick around long enough to see yourself off. Twilight went back at the most a week (possibly less) and was limited to about a minute. Eventually you reach a point where you would only materialize in the past for nanoseconds,  making it completely useless.
<p></p>Combine that with having the spell be rather lengthy to prepare and plan,  and you have a very useful,  but very limited time traveling ability. Of course,  this is all one big WMG,  but it's the best way I can think of to work it without resorting to more cliched temporal correction methods.

            <div class="quoteblock">Since Twilight didn't even know it was possible until her future self informed her,  it seems to be leaning toward Stable Time Loop or Parallel Timelines at this point. Of course,  maybe they'll get really creative. I hope they do.</div>
But then the question would be just how creative they'd be able to get in the short medium of a 22 minute episode. <br> <br>I was excited for the episode before,  but my interest keeps increasing. I'm definitely more interested in seeing how this turns out than I was for last week's episode. <br> <br><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">why.

            I just hope it's not a re-hash of Lesson Zero,  or if it is in some way then it deals with what Lesson Zero doesn't (no,  Twilight,  a lack of problems doesn't give you license to start problems. Ever.)
<p></p>Also this fandom makes me feel old.
