            He is,  but he has a personality outside of liking Rarity. Hell,  he's even made fun of her.  Besides,  it was taken too far where it seemed like an overused gag. It was cute in the diamond dog ones,  but annoying here.

            I agree that episode 2 is really cheesy,  but as I've said before,  I find it cheesey in a delicious way.
<p></p>I just rewatched Pinkie Keen last night and I think that's a candidate for what I feel is one of the weaker episodes.  I know Faust stated that the moral wasn't supposed to do with relgion,  but just the way the episode plays it,  I find it really hard to unperceive the notion that it is.  The slapstick is still entertaining,  but I feel like it really isn't enough to keep the rest of the episode from grating on me.
<p></p>Edit: I can't spell today.

Just a little bit mind,  but it seems that she's almost always the one in the right (Her Pinkie Sense annoyed the shit out of me for one),  she can find books in Twilight's house better than Twilight can. She's faster than Rainbow Dash. She's a lot smarter than she lets on,  and outside of Party of One she never gets tricked or inconvenienced in a way that hurts her feelings. She was also the only one that SOMEHOW knew what the Parasprites were,  and knew how to stop them (fuck even ZECORAH didn't know how to stop them)

            I'd like to ask something of the thread,  if I may. Would someone here be willing to do a bit of photoshop work for the sake of a little experiment?
<p></p>The request is to take <a class="urllink" href="http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/wow/0aaunitednation.jpg">this logo<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small> and photoshop it onto Rainbow Dash. The reason why is that I noticed recently that the shade of blue she was in looks a lot like the very shade of blue that is in the United Nations emblem and I want to see if it looks at all alike. I can't imagine Rainbow Dash herself would object,  given the ecumenical and universally tolerant driving ethic of the United Nations.

            I do agree there should be more Pinkie is wrong incidents. And Applejack should get to be right :| Although I guess with Pinkie the main thing is that she's too easygoing to really be bothered by a lot. If someone disagrees with her,  she doesn't really mind.

            I don't find any of the episodes to be bad,  but the ones I'm about to list,  I don't care much to re-watch.
The Ticket Master,  to me,  had to most predictable plot. The episode with Pinkie twitching made Twilight far more arrogant than she should be. Owls Well That Ends Well was disappointing. It is the only Spike driven episode and they made him out as a jealous type.

            Wort episode? I don't have one,  all of them are good,  some of them weaker (many from first part of s1 or Dog & Pony Show) but I can't pick any to be worst.
<p></p>And for that what other complain:
- I love pilots (second one maybe more),  they are ones of my fav eps
- I love Feeling Pinkie Keen,  it had so much funny stuff and awesome hydra stuff and I can only facepalming about that hole discusion about suposed religious mesage.
- I like Green Isn't Your Colour and Owl That Ends Well to (maybe ending with Owl was little disopiting).

Still that's the good thing of the show. The mane cast is so varied,  their personalities appeal to a lot of people

            I'm probably going to be lynched for this,  but I wasn't a huge fan of Cutie Mark Chronicles *dodges bricks*
<p></p>The only flashbacks that I found all that entertaining were Twilight's and Pinkie Pie's.  The other ones just seemed to me like they didn't give us any new info about the characters.  I mean,  we know Rainbow Dash likes flying,  Fluttershy likes animals,  Applejack is a farmer,  etc.  It wasn't a bad episode by any means,  but I feel like they could have done a lot more with the idea.
<p></p>More obviously,  I'm not a big fan of Over a Barrel either; it relied too much on new characters and the mane cast didn't really do a whole lot.
<p></p>I actually didn't mind Ticket Master that much; the plot has been done before,  but I think that they <em>way</em> they did it made sense for the characters (of course Twilight doesn't know what to do,  she's new at this) and the ways that the other ponies were sucking up to her was pretty entertaining.
<p></p>The overall plot of Owl's Well that Ends Well wasn't that great,  but between Spikely Whiplash and the quest for the Quill,  I thought that it was funny enough to overlook the problems.
<p></p>EDIT: Favorite pony?  That's a tough one.  I probably sympathize most with Twilight,  because she's actually pretty similar to me,  but I also like Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy a lot...argggg...
