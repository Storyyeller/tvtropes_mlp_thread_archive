            @JT I'm thinking more singular stories than television shows.
<p></p>And I didn't necessarily mean an action scene (I'm not stupid) I just meant that the first few pages should work to build intrigue and grab the reader's interest in some way rather than going straight for the mundane characterization stuff.
<p></p>Intrigue is the energy that initially keeps the reader going. It lasts until the characters have become firmly established,  at which point they and the plot at large is what keeps the reader engaged.
<p></p>Sorry if I'm not making any sense. You guys were the ones who took writing classes,  not me. I'm just going by what I've learnt in scriptwriting classes <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            Yeah,  writing scripts for individual episodes or isolated short stories is probably a lot different.  I personally really like long-term setup and payoffs,  so I'm hardly averse if a story takes a bit to establish the setting or whatnot.  But yeah,  it definitely has to do it in way that keeps the reader interested.  It's just that it doesn't have to be in the form of some big action-y thing.  You could have an entire chapter dedicated to the setting as long you can make the reader want to learn more about the setting and make the prose interesting.  It's tougher that way,  but I think it can be done.

            BLUH,  I got interrupted in the middle of the episode (actually more like 6 or 7 minutes in) and now I won't be able to finish it until to tomorrow,  maybe not even then.  Well,  at least I have something to look forward too.

<p></p>This is exactly what they tell you over and over again when you're trying to get published.  I've rewritten the first 5 pages of my novel about 7 times and completely changed the scene from how it began.

            @JT it doesn't have to be an action-thing though,  I never said that. GOD I wish I could articulate myself better!
<p></p>The first episode of MLP does what I'm talking about. It starts with that narration about the sisters,  and the birth of Nightmare Moon. It creates intrigue. Our desire to know more about that is what keeps us going through the early scenes. Until the characters have been firmly established and we've endeared ourselves to them,  at which point our focus shifts. Then we're suddenly watching it for the characters. and our connection to them,  and their adventures is what carries us throughout therest of the series. To hell with the sisters <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

<p></p>Your making complete sense gingy,  what you are talking about is strategy my Creative Writing teacher calls "boom and draw",  it's similar to something music artists do: where they have a loud and/or huge note that grabs the reader/listener's attention and draws them in. The idea is to make the reader care (rationally or not) for what is happening above all else so that they will keep reading.
<p></p>Personally,  my opinion of a book is largely decided in the first paragraph or so. TV is another matter entirely however,  I will watch any show at least five episodes before condemning or approving it. Mostly because it takes much more time to build up intrigue and investment in a Tv Show then it does a book.

<p></p>In the begining we have a Baby,  two magical persons,  and glying motercycle and two dead parents. We arent told why they died or how,  only that they where and that the baby surived for a unknown reason. After that it slowly builds it's characters and setting revealing all of that stuff in time while  winning investment from the reader.

<p></p>No Ginger,  I was agreeing with you.  You're exactly right,  the very beginning of any story is extremely important and you have to start off strong or you won't get any readers/viewers,  whatever.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> I dunno,  depends on the book. Harry Potter took a while to get into gear. So have other books. </div>
<p></p>Well the first two books weren't very good.

It could be any of them though.

            I think Scootaloo ought to get her's first.  She's the only one of the three who has a clear talent that she KNOWS she's good at and actually enjoys doing.  Sweetie Belle is a great singer,  but she doesn't think she's anything special,  and I'm not even sure myself what Applebloom's talent is.

At this point,  it's more likely that Hasbro (temporarily) pulled the episode and the merch while they secured the copyright.  I believe everything is back up now.
