            So I finished reading what is done of "An Earth Pony's Guide to Magic"  I found it really good,  my only concern is that Star Swirl comes off a bit like an Sue-ish Twilight Sparkle expy.
<p></p>I do like the way she analyzes the different magics she encounters though.  Very good theories on how certain things work,  some have become headcannon <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">
<p></p>I look forward to reading the final chapters!

            Sure.  She's been eaten,  smashed,  thrown off cliffs,  beaten with metal bars,  ate things that should've been poisonous,  nearly drowned,  and once had to watch a marathon of Irate Gamer episodes.
<p></p>Never stopped that pony,  and its never going to.

            <em>There lived in old Equestria <br>The Princess fair Celestia <br>Charged with moving the moon and sun above,  <br> <br>She had no partner,  nor a friend,  <br>To aid in her task without end,  <br>She despaired for she had no-one to love. <br> <br>One night she returned to her room,  <br>Her only friend midnight's dim gloom,  <br>She sighed sadly,  and shook rainbow-maned head,  <br> <br>She opened her room's heavy door,  <br>And was shocked to her very core,  <br>A filly was asleep upon her bed! <br> <br>The little one woke with a sigh,  <br>And opened her lovely green eyes,  <br>Celestia felt pure joy fill her heart,  <br> <br>Her veil of woe was shorn away,  <br>And friendship gained upon that day,  <br>The Princess knew that they would never part. <br> <br>Her mane and fur both dark as night,  <br>They glowed softly with their own light,  <br>The filly's eyes were a-glow just the same. <br> <br>Bereft of name; of title none,  <br>Celestia chose for her one: <br>"Luna" would be her friend and equal's name. <br> <br>Sun Princess laughed as sadness died,  <br>Its touch,  its grasp,  its hold denied,  <br>She knew the purpose of this little one: <br> <br>To bring loneliness to an end,  <br>To be both her sister and friend,  <br>To raise the moon when she lowered the sun. <br> <br>She taught her sister what to do,  <br>And proclaimed "Luna,  I trust you,  <br>To take on this duty and do it right,  <br> <br>To you this duty I now give,  <br>And for as long as we both live,  <br>I shall be the day and you are the night." <br> <br>Years uncounted floated by,  <br>The sisters two both shared the sky,  <br>But soon envy stole into Luna's soul,  <br> <br>The envy seethed,  bubbled and stirred,  <br>To Luna wicked whispers purred,  <br>And they slowly began to take their toll. <br> <br>"They all ignore your nightly toil,  <br>Does it not cause your blood to boil? <br>Why bother to continue anyway? <br> <br>You raise the moon after sun's fall,  <br>But no one cares,  no one at all,  <br>They wait for your sister to bring the day!" <br> <br>She paid no heed,  or so she tried,  <br>To this dark voice found deep inside <br>For sister princess she truly adored,  <br> <br>She pushed the wicked thought away,  <br>But it was strengthened day by day,  <br>And stabbed at her heart like a sharpened sword. <br> <br>It tore at her,  it slashed and screamed,  <br>Both while awake and while she dreamed,  <br>The walls within her mind fell one by one,  <br> <br>It breached the light within her soul <br>The darkness took complete control,  <br>And she confronted her sister,  the Sun. <br> <br>"You are the only one they see,  <br>No love is given unto me,  <br>Next to you,  I am merely second rate; <br> <br>I soon felt envy towards you,  <br>But that feeling,  it swelled and grew,  <br>And now for you I feel nothing but hate. <br> <br>I will force them to all love me,  <br>For I shall be all that they see,  <br>I will banish your sunlight infernal,  <br> <br>When ponies look up to the sky,  <br>They will not see you,  only I; <br>For I shall bring forth Midnight Eternal!" <br> <br>To aid her in this wicked deed <br>The demon Nightmare Moon was freed <br>She set about to see this dark work done,  <br> <br>And so the day confronted night,  <br>And so the dark confronted light,  <br>And so that day were seen both Moon and Sun. <br> <br>Nightmare,  defeated come duel's end,  <br>Was begged stop by her sister-friend,  <br>But Nightmare laughed and spat into her eye,  <br> <br>With both a foul curse and a leer,  <br>She swore revenge on "sister dear" <br>And would return to make the sunlight die. <br> <br>With Luna lost to hatred's voice,  <br>The princess made a fateful choice,  <br>Only one punishment could fit this crime: <br> <br>Using her most powerful spell,  <br>She made the pale moon Nightmare's cell,  <br>Her prison forever and for all time. <br> <br>Sun Princess took back night's power,  <br>And from her castle's high tower,  <br>She once again controls both night and day,  <br> <br>Now when she makes evening's moon rise,  <br>Grief-stricken tears flow from her eyes,  <br>For she still feels she failed Luna some way. <br> <br>So should you hear dark envy speak,  <br>No matter how strong nor how weak,  <br>I pray you take this tragic tale to heart: <br> <br>Fight it with all your soul within,  <br>For if you let that demon win,  <br>It can tear friendships and families apart.</em>
