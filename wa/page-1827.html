Others say it wasn't Luna's fault at all and she was corrupted by evil magic space miasma or something.

<p></p>Faust later clarified that she meant there was a force of some kinda that corrupted Luna into becomeing NMM,  but it's was all Luna's decisions. kinda like Darth Vader,  Palpatine was there in the background pushing Anakin into turning evil,  but it was ultimately Anakin's choice to give into it. same for Luna,  there was something driving her to turn evil,  but she gave into it willingly.

I am pretty sure it was both,  like she was discorded or something.
<p></p>She gave in to temptation,  and then the temptation corrupted her. Otherwise it would have meant elements of harmony would be able to brainwash evil people into doing good things.

Inconsistency in aesop delivery and characterization. Acting OOC is perfectly fine if it's justified,  but something like Fluttershy being not concerned with animals getting hurt is not.

Typical tomboys. Both of them. And a pretty realistic portrayal,  actually.

            @Ace: Maybe a cross between Kagura and Tomo,  then?  The main reason I thought of Tomo is because of Rainbow Dash being a prankster,  and I don't really ever remember Kagura doing pranks much,  if at all.  Tomo teases people (mainly Chiyo) more which would also be like Dash.

            Okay,  this is going to be pretty massive,  so just bear with me for a moment here:
<p></p><ol><li>: I think this episode is the most jerkish Dash has been because it's the only one where she actually endangered others by stopping to do her catch phrase before doing the rescue; if the Mare Do Well hadn't shown up,  somepony could have gotten hurt because of it.  In Fall Weather Friends,  the cheating didn't stand to hurt anypony,  and in the race in the previous episode was <em>purely voluntary</em>.  Yes,  the gorge was dangerous,  but the animals only had themselves to blame if they chose to take part.
<p></p></li><li>: I think Discord is a more effective villain than NM because he's actually successful to a degree; pretty much all of NMM's onscreen villainy failed. As for NMM's effect on the status quo: That's only because it was the pilot episode.  It <em>has</em> to set the tone for the rest of the season.
<p></p></li><li>: Coming off of that point,  regarding the whole <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">Growing the Beard</a> thing: It's not that people dislike the pilot,  it's just that the later episodes are more character driven because they don't spent half their time introducing the cast.  We get to see them just being themselves rather than watching the episode trying to summarize their characterization so quickly.
<p></p></li><li>: In response to the whole "Ponyville is OOC" thing,  Pacific State wanted me to post his thoughts on the matter:
</li></ol><p></p><div class="quoteblock">
You think the New York of Marvel Comics feels anything like the real place? No,  for the purpose of the story,  we were in comicbook world. RD was basically Superman with the attitude of Darkwing Duck,  and the Mare Do Well was Batman with Darkwing's design and a bit of the Phantom,  who happened to the Legacy Character and whose mask was donned by many.
<p></p>As for the rescue plots,  the dam is from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLantern" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a>,  the baby is from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerRangers" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a> (it was the episode where Bulk and Skull started their <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel Face Turn</a>),  the cart (WHY DO PONIES RIDE IN A CART?) was from Superman (except it was a Jumbo jet,  but ponies don't have that... yet) and the construction site collapsing was <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderMan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>.
<p></p>Plus,  the events in this episode could have been spaced over months. It's just that each episode has one theme and as little continuity as possible and thus you don't get a series of subplots taking place simultaneously.
</div>
<p></p>I think he's on to something with the superhero references,  but I'm still not sold on the idea.  Ponyville has been portrayed in a certain manner for pretty much the entire show,  and this episode disregards a lot of it.  I don't think being a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout Out</a> to something else really justifies changing the setting so much (if Twilight suddenly started acting like Tony Stark,  it would still be OOC,  regardless of whether it was an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronMan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronMan">Iron Man</a> reference),  but if his list of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">ShoutOuts</a> is accurate,  it makes a bit more sense.
<p></p>I feel like there was something else I was going to give my 2 cents on,  but I can't remember what it was.  Oh well,  time for lunch.
