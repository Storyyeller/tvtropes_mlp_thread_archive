            <div class="quoteblock">Wow,  that's pretty rough. Kind of makes me wonder if Twi ever had any profs like that. If she did,  I can see that really influencing her perception of Celestia's expectations (if the hard ass prof is really tough to please,  logically speaking,  the princess must be even tougher).</div>
<p></p>Yeah. As I said. Insane. Plus my Afrikaans teacher that year didn’t like me (to be fair,  I don’t think she liked anyone,  unlike my accounting teacher who didn’t like me specifically)
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">@Sereg: Wow,  good lord. Hell,  Canada only technically has two languages - good luck finding someone outside of Quebec or Nova Scotia who actually speaks french. Does South Africa at least a have a decent language education system? Aside from the insanity of course. Because Canada's is worthless... we have mandatory french classes for eight years,  and most people will come out of school not speaking a word of it aside from motherfucking pronouns.</div>
<p></p>We have a mandatory second language course as well. I think for even longer. Might even be for all twelve years IIRC. I got a D. Lowest passing grade is an E. My Afrikaans is considered by most to be really bad but serviceable. There was actually a girl in my first year of university who would chat to me in Afrikaans and only realised I was English a couple of months later. I was surprised. She thought that my difficulties were just me being a foreigner with a weird accent. But me being an English South African explained it. We also typically have some compulsory third language training for a couple of years that we are allowed to extend. I ended up also having a fourth due to a quirk,  but that was only for a term. There’s also the fact that most South Africans do what we call “Menging our tale” (Meng is Afrikaans for “mix”. Tale is Afrikaans for “languages”. You never add the suffix “ing” to an Afrikaans word ever. Not even then.) So you can throw in the vocabulary and grammar of one language into another. I must admit that French grammar made zero sense to me. Zulu grammar did though. My sister says that Zulu grammar gets much harder at university level though.
<p></p>Of course,  I also know a <em>tiny</em> bit of some other languages. My handle name comes from Sindarin after all.

<p></p>Actually,  there was a good point in the comments.  Celestia makes a big deal about Twilight being able to choose her destiny now,  but then makes her a princess and spirits her off to Canterlot to be saddled with tremendous soul-crushing responsibility and political red tape.

            Word from the staff is that Twilight isn't going to leave her friends or Ponyville for a while,  right?
<p></p>With a new Princess living there,  I don't think Ponyville is going to stay a rustic backwater for very long.

            @Pykrete: I don't know about that. Flying is easy. <em>Landing</em> is hard.  I'm personally hoping that the first scene of S4 is Twilight flying into a tree.

            They could still probably do it. Twilight turns out to just be really <em>bad</em> at it. There's more to flying than gliding,  sort of thing.

Was the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">alicorn-ation</span> the desired effect,  or was it supposed to reveal one's true destiny?
<p></p>And are spoiler tags still needed?

            Dude,  how many new faces have we gotten lately? I don't think I recognize half the people here anymore...
<p></p>Erm,  but no,  no spoiler tags necessary. We all know what went down by now. It's accepted here that spoiler tags are only necessary until the episode airs.

            @Gleam: It's never explicitly stated what the spell was supposed to do,  but my theory is that Star Swirl was trying to make a spell that can turn somepony into an alicorn. He just didn't realize that the elements were required.  Then Twilight inadvertently completed it.

            I've noticed how some people comment on how Twilight is flying without even taking lessons. A couple of things I'd like to point out:
<p></p><ol><li> We didn't see her take off. That means she either had a running start or...her friends grabbed her and tossed her,  like Shining Armor did with his wife Cadence. Twi-Tossing! &lt;Smirk&gt;
</li><li> That part at the end was a clear instance of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">Breaking the Fourth Wall</a>. Instances like that are played for laughs and should not be taken seriously.
</li></ol><p></p>I hear that Season 4 is going to open with a two-part episode. Well,  actually,  it's three parts and "Magical Mystery Cure" is simply the first part of three. I wonder what will happen next. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">

            I serioulsy was expecting Twilight to smack into the "camera" at the end of the episode.
<p></p>As to the spell,  well,  if we take the original snippet,  and put Twilight's verse on to it,  it comes out as this:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">From one to another,  another to one. A mark of one's destiny singled out alone,  fulfilled. From all of us together,  together we are friends. With the marks of our destinies made one,  there is magic without end.</div>
<p></p>Anyone want to venture a guess to what that all <em>means</em>?
<p></p>I think I can see why the first verse did what it did. In the context of the spell as finished by Twilight,  it's something about power shared between them,  but without that context,  it literally moved the marks of destiny "from one to another".
