            Yeah,  it's like I pointed out when the episode came out,  magic when you're a baby seems to depend more on your base desires,  like how Pumpkin was able to use magic to get the toys over to her because she wanted them. And Rarity did say that they had fits of magic that come and go. It's probably that she'll have to learn finer control over her abilities to actually make them do a specific thing,  rather than something general.

            It wouldn't necessarily make RD a jerk; it would actually give her a pretty good opportunity to finally show her better side.  Like she's totally willing to help Scootaloo out,  and Scoots feels bad when it doesn't work or something.  As long as they made Rainbow Dash more of an enthusiastic teacher rather than a drill sergeant it could work.  In "Call of the Cutie" she was totally willing to help Apple Bloom out.

            Yeah,  if anything I see Rainbow Dash being a bit too gung-ho when it comes to teaching.  I think she'd be enthusiastic but accidentally push too hard.

            Aww,  it sounds like this is setting up a scene where Scootaloo tells off RD and stops idolizing her.  Even if it's only temporary that would make me really sad.

            She never got upset with RD in that one,  she just got distracted by another pony.  And even that depressed me a bit.  Scoots!  How could you?

            I've just realised an interesting implication of my earth pony parents hypothesis. If I'm right,  then if they were raised by their parents,  the Apple siblings would be even stronger than they are in canon!

            Hypothetical episode idea: Scootaloo asks Rainbow to teach her to fly; Rainbow blows her off and tells her to ask Fluttershy instead.  I dunno how that would work out.
