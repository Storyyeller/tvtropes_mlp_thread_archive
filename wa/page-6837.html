<p></p>Someone already explained what it is,  but here's a video of the attack in action.
<p></p>Massive spoilers for G Gundam,  if you care. What you need to know is that Domon's the main character,  Rain is one of his love interests/his partner in the Gundam Fight,  and Domon is part of something called the Shuffle Alliance,  with the codename "King of Hearts".
<p></p>Oh,  and that the dub is extremely cheesy. Skip to 0:53 if you only want to see the attack.

            Even if I talk about which episodes I like the least,  I don't actually outright dislike any of them. You know how you tend to nitpick things apart over time? I end up doing the opposite,  so even the very few episodes that left a bad taste in my mouth have grown on me to the point of being quite enjoyable as I find lots of little things to like in each of them.

            Really. The line makes perfect sense. Luna was merely enforcing a Curfew. I suspect if it wasn't Twilight,  said pony running around would have gotten a heavy dose of Royal Canterlot voice (And a few hours of interrogation by the guards)

            He ordered the cook to come before him. The cook was terrified when he heard this order,  and he said to All-Kinds-of-Hair,  "For sure you let a hair fall into the soup. If that's true,  you'll get a beating."
<p></p>When the cook came before the prince he was asked who had cooked the soup,  and he answered,  "I cooked it."
<p></p>The prince said,  "That is not true,  for it was made in a different way,  and much better than usual."
<p></p>The cook answered,  "I must confess that I did not cook it,  it was the strange little filly."
<p></p>The prince said,  "Go and have her come up here."
<p></p>When All-Kinds-of-Hair arrived,  the prince asked,  "Who are you."
<p></p>"I am a poor filly who no longer has a father or a mother."
<p></p>He asked further,  "What are you doing in my castle?"
<p></p>She answered,  "I am good for nothing,  except having horseshoes thrown at my head."
<p></p>He asked further,  "Where did you get the ring that was in the soup?"
<p></p>She answered,  "I do not know anything about the ring."
<p></p>Thus the prince could learn nothing,  and he had to send her away again.

<p></p>Right. Canterlot is on high alert,  so Luna's informing her of the cerfew.

<p></p>Well,  that video I posted throws in little captions to "correct" the dialogue. I don't know if I want to see a fandubbed version that changes the lines. G Gundam's dub is so infamously cheesy that I don't think it <em>should</em> be changed.

            Oh,  yeah. I guess I should do some compliments. Favorites would be Sweet and Elite,  Sisterhooves Social,  and Hearth's Warming Eve. Oh,  look at that,  Rarity popping up in my favorites. What a surprise. It's just that Rarity is the most entertaining to watch and has the best interactions with others. I actually can't think of many issues I had with any of these three,  if any. <br> <br>Surprisingly,  I actually liked Dragon Quest. I'd guess it's because Spike wasn't being a silly kid/hormonal monster. The music and settings really had a lot to do with it,  too. <br> <br>Ponyville Confidential was great. We always need more Diamond Tiara and Sweetie Belle being smart. <br> <br>Also a fan of Cutie Pox for humor reasons. Sure,  it's kind of disturbing,  but given how much AJ cares,  there was no way she would've allowed the pox to stay. I also have to give them credit for making so many talents show up. <br> <br>And yeah,  the worst I have is that the episodes are somewhat forgettable. Secret of My Excess being the bottom of the list,  with the only scene I really remember being the Wonderbolts one. <br> <br>Stop posting so much,  I've had to add so many sentences/paragraphs. <br> <br><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">But what is she thinking about?

            Some time later there was another banquet,  and All-Kinds-of-Hair,  as before,  asked the cook for permission to have a look. He answered,  "Yes,  but come back in a half hour and cook the bread soup for the prince that he likes so much."
<p></p>She ran to her cubbyhole,  quickly washed herself,  then took from the nut the dress that was as silver as the moon and put it on. Then she went upstairs and looked like a princess. The prince came up to her and was delighted to see her again,  and because a dance was just beginning,  they danced together. But as soon as the dance was over she again disappeared so quickly that the prince did not notice where she went.
<p></p>She ran to her cubbyhole,  turned herself back into a strange filly,  and went to the kitchen to make the bread soup. While the cook was upstairs she got the golden spinning wheel and put it in the bowl,  so that the soup was prepared on top of it. Then it was taken to the prince,  who ate it,  and it tasted as good to him as the last time. He had the cook brought before him,  who again had to confess that All-Kinds-of-Hair had made the soup. All-Kinds-of-Hair again came before the prince,  and she answered that she was only good for having horseshoes thrown at her head,  and that she knew nothing at all about the little golden spinning wheel.

            I'm pretty sure it' a fairytale.   It very closely parallels the French fairy tale Peau d'Âne,  or Donkeyskin.

            @Drenius: I'm quite sure I've read a really ancient fairy tale that's quite like it,  from a time when the grammar was a little different but still parse-able.

            When the prince gave a banquet for the third time,  everything happened as before. But this time the cook said,  "You are a witch,  you strange filly,  always putting something in the soup that makes it very good and taste better to the prince." But because she asked,  he allowed her to look in on the ball at the appointed time.
<p></p>This time she put on the dress that glistened like the stars,  and thus clothed she stepped into the hall. The prince danced again with the beautiful mare,  thinking that she had never been so beautiful. And while he was dancing he placed a golden ring on her tail,  without her noticing it. Further,  he had ordered that this dance should last a long time. When it was over,  he tried to keep hold of her by her dress,  but she tore herself loose and jumped so quickly into the crowd that she disappeared before his eyes. She ran as fast as she could to her cubbyhole beneath the steps,  but because she had stayed away too long,  more than a half hour,  she could not take off the beautiful dress,  but instead just threw the cloak of hair on over it. And in her haste,  she did not cover herself entirely with dirt,  and one hoof remained clean.
