            Pretty sure we've had some thumpings more recently than that,  though the only ones I can think of right now were troll posts.

            It's true that old DW had very decompressed serials,  the special effects were <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm">Narm Charm</a> at best,  and some docs were better than others,  but the revival series often treats the Doctor as a messiah figure with piles of angst.
<p></p>There was never any doubt that he could get out of that week's scrape,  but they at least tried to make the escapes and solutions work according to the rules of that particular serial rather than pulling out a blatant <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaosixMachina" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaosixMachina">Daosix Machina</a>.

            Hence why so many just start with the new series. Because there is SO much behind it,  it takes so long to get through most stories,  and it's so damn hard to actually find most of them.
<p></p>None of which makes it bad Dark. It's still a freking amazing show all around.

            @dark:  Yeah,  that's one of my biggest problems with New Who.  Way too often the ending of an episode relies on a bunch of technobabel  The Doctor just pulls out of his ass at the last minute.
<p></p>@JT:  Seriously,  no one gets into Doctor Who by watching all the old series.  You don't need to worry about that at all.  Just start with Nine and keep going until you catch up or decide you don't like it.

            Yeah,  DW is one of the few shows to have a ton of continuity and rarely makes it plot-critical. In the old series at least. The revival is pretty plot-based and more or less stands on it's own as a separate section of the universe. You'll miss some nods and a few semicritical stuff like why planets ingulfed in flames is the Doctor's biggest fear,  but you can start Nine just fine.
<p></p>Though if there was any classic Doctor I'd recommend on their own merits,  I'd say Three and Seven.

            I'd suggest just picking a particular Doctor/companion combo and watching all their episodes.  That keeps things at an easy to watch one or two seasons,  and if you enjoy it you can continue from there.

            The episodes I've seen so far are Midnight,  Closing Time,  and Blink. Closing Time was a bit problematic since it relied a lot on continuity.

<p></p>I think what happened with Posey demonstrates why that is never acceptable (because some people are in such a fragile state they might actually take up your 'suggestion').  As someone who lost a family member to sucide I don't think highly of those who suggest it,  but kudos to you for trying at least to take a conciliary approach.  Educate rather than punish might be enough...maybe.
<p></p>Although I have wished death on people from the headlines in other threads.  Child killers mostly.  So maybe I'm a hypocrite.
<p></p>And that op goes ok Thirk.
