<p></p><ul><li>Dragon in Dragonshy
</li><li>The Cockatrice
</li><li>Flutterrage in "Best Night Ever" (and that's more frustration than explicit anger)
</li><li>This episode.
</li></ul><p></p>There are probably a few more occasions that I've missed,  but there really aren't many occasions where she gets actually angry.
<p></p>@Badwolf: Yeah,  that's what I get for trying to finish it up at midnight rather than waiting a day.  I'll go fix that.  I'm really not sure what to say about the goats,  considering they don't really do much other than act as assistants to Iron Will.  They don't really have any real effect on the episode.  I might edit in a paragraph about them later.

            Big,  sappy,  personal,  almost,  but not quite,  offtopic post.  Spoilered for those who just want ponies.  I know it's coming out of nowhere,  but I feel like it's something I should share and you guys are good enough friends to appreciate what it means.
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> I actually had an important insight into myself last night.  For several years now,  I've been thinking about the kind of person I want to be,  specifically,  what kind of person I would be if I extrapolated my basic personality into the best possible version of myself.  Over time I accumulated a large,  somewhat nebulous collection of traits and an overall impression,  but it was never concrete enough for my satisfaction.  </span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then last night,  I started wondering why it was so easy for me to write that Fancy Pants letter in my blog,  while I struggle to write a single line of dialogue for characters who I've analyzed more and understand much better than him.  Everything from the language to the progression of the letter,  to the balance of dignity and resolve to do the right thing came out on the first try.  That's when it hit me.  I hadn't really tried to write that from Fancy Pants's view,  I'd tried to write it from the view of my "ideal self, " because he's so similar to a lot of the things I want to see in myself.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It wouldn't be strictly true to say I've recieved life direction from this show,  because all the thoughts and feelings involved pre-date my entrance into the fandom,  but it's served as the catalyst for insight.  In that moment of realization,  the big cloud of fuzzy ideas folded into itself and became a single,  solid,  usable insight into myself,  and for the first time in my life I was able to look at something and say clearly,  "This is who I want to be."</span>

The video in question was one let's player standing up for another and calling for people to support him. It was really sweet,  but it's since been deleted.
<p></p>So,  somebody who doesn't agree with my entry can just delete it. And like it or not,  Bronies aren't widely accepted. We're about as accepted in the general public's eyes as gays were in the 1950's.

            Bad: I agree to an extent.  The goats seems to have a pretty sharp eye when they were scrutinizing the crowd during Will's speeches.  While I think Will is the boss of the operation,  going off of that little huddle before ceding to Fluttershy,  I'd say he definitely seems to trust the goats to give him feedback and advice.

            I don't think I've ever had one of those giant epiphany moments,  at least not about my current self.  It's always been more of a reflection on what I did in the past and realizing exactly why I did what I did and how it lead me to where I am now.  But really,  I think that kind of thing differs from person to person.  For me it's a long,  gradual shift,  while for others it might be a single rapid change.
