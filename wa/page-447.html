            new thought after reading the WMG page. the CMC haven't got their marks yet because their trying to force it. the just need to stop and realize what they like and are good at. and all three of the Crusaders talents have been hinted at. Scootaloo's a dare devil,  Sweetie Belle's a singer,  and Apple Bloom's a handy-pony.

<p></p>Hm.  It's kind of interesting to note the discussion that was going on when I came into the thread; it was about what a pony would (or should) do if their cutie mark was something they didn't like doing,  if I recall rightly.  That's actually closely related to the Crusaders' view of what gives one their cutie mark,  and just as wrong.  It's not a duty that's assigned to you randomly,  to be carried out for the rest of your life once you find out what it is; it's proof that you've found your calling in life.

            I wonder if it's possible for a cutie mark to change later in life due to some major life changing event,  like one's Patronus can change in the Potterverse.

            I like to think so - I have an idea for a fic that revolves around that.
<p></p>Really,  the question comes down to whether it's a 'destined' course,  or a 'decided' course. If someone,  as a child,  decides that they want to be an Olympic athlete and get the seven rings as their mark,  but they suffer a crippling injury,  and they go through a funk or something and someone helps them out of it,  and they're so thankful they want to be able to do that,  they might get switched to a psychology cutie mark. But that's a chosen path - if it's destiny,  well,  sucks to be them,  they're now stuck with a crippling injury <em>and</em> permanent CMFIS.
<p></p>Personally,  I think the first one is more appropriate for the universe.

<p></p>Problem is: When you say "calling in life",  do you mean: Something they really want to do,  or something that they're really good at? because I can tell you,  I'm good at a lot of things that I positively HATE,  and shit at a few things that I love.

            I think part of the implication is that it's something they're good at <em>because</em> they love doing it.  Or possibly vice-versa.  They develop a skill by having the will to learn it,  or have a natural talent that they appreciate.

            Being a Silversmith is important!  Or a royal taste-tester!
<p></p>Actually,  we don't know what their cutie-marks mean,  as the story wasn't about them and their role in life.

            @gingerninj. the whole idea is that a pony's special talent is something they're good at AND like doing.

            Yeah and Diamond Tiara could also mean she's in a position of leadership.
<p></p>And nothing in Show Stoppers indicated that the CMC DISLIKED the fields they were talented in.  They just didn't realize how much they liked their real skills.

            I think what RS means is that the two options of what the cutie marks could be are as follows:
<p></p><ul><li>They just appear at random,  deciding what a pony's purpose in life is.
</li><li>They appear as a result of the pony finding their desired purpose in life; or to restate it,  they appear when a pony realizes what they want spend their lives doing.
</li></ul><p></p>I lean towards the latter,  and I think it just makes more sense in view of the show itself.  With that interpretation,  Silver Spoon didn't really get such a raw deal; there's nothing she wants more in life than to just be doted on,  so that's what she's going to be.  She doesn't aspire to any other purpose,  so the cutie mark reflects that. If she <em>wanted</em> to be something more than what she is,  the mark would be different.
<p></p>It still raises the question of what happens when somepony's "purpose" changes,  but I'd guess that either the cutie mark changes,  or they find a new purpose that could still be reflected by the same mark (i.e. Silver Spoon becomes a silversmith or cook or something).
<p></p>My favorite CMC is probably Apple Bloom because she's adorable,  and has the most <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>.  I like the other two (and they're also adorable),  but Scootaloo seems more like a stock tomboy character,  and Sweetie Belle just doesn't seem as interesting when compared to Scootaloo or Applebloom,  probably because AB got more episodes,  and Scoots' personality is a lot more active and in-your-face.

            and regarding an earlier back and forth on Sweetie Belle,  "ditzy" definitly is the wrong word because on this wiki,  it means "the dumbass character" and she's just a little slow on the uptake. the real dumbasses of this show are Snips and Snails.
