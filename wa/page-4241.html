            hehe @ ginger/kegi debate,  reminds me of junior year English classes,  at least once a week I'd get into the "meaning vs. entertainment" debate with her,  of course,  didn't help that she insisted on finding the meaning in EVERYTHING even shit that really didn't have one,  she's the type that would try and tell you what Tolkein meant by this or that,  when Tolkein himself said there WAS no deeper allegorical meaning to anything he wrote because he hated that shit.
<p></p>oh and about 80% of everything ever written apparently had a deeper meaning that was some how tied to sex.

            That may well be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor">Death Of The Author</a>,  Seraph. An artist naturally includes their opinions on certain things into a work whether they want to or not.
<p></p>Now granted,  analyzing this serves only to learn about the creator. If he explicitly din't want to include a moral,  then there's no reason to go looking for one.

            Something interesting I learned while lurking today: Light is the only <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> villain Ginger doesn't like. Just because he's the main character doesn't mean he's not the villain.
<p></p>Now as for Order,  I'd think it would turn the Elements of Harmony against themselves,  as some of them are naturally orderly. In fact,  it pretty much splits them down the middle,  with Loyalty,  Honesty,  and Generosity representing order,  and Laughter,  Kindness,  and Magic representing chaos (or spontaneity,  if chaos has too negative of a connotation).

            @Blue Media itself is manipulative by nature. It plays us into caring about the characters and worlds that it creates. I'm ok with that.
<p></p>I don't like being AWARE that I'm being manipulated though. THAT is why I don't like things that are incredibly meaningful (or if I do,  then not for all of the meaning horseshit)
<p></p>You may say "Oh,  that's just because it was heavy handed in how the message was delivered" Well I haven't seen a SINGLE film/book/game that's done it right if that's the case. I don't like feeling as if the writer is wallowing in his own cleverness.
<p></p>Focus on making something ENTERTAINING! Focus on making the characters sympathetic.
<p></p>When something was made purely because the creator "wanted to make people think" I INSTANTLY turn off.

<p></p>Well the Auditors have several weaknesses. For example,  they disappear if they use personal pronouns or eat too much chocolate.
<p></p>@Bluespace,  have you played the game <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Iji" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Iji">Iji</a>. It sounds like you might be interested. You can play through the whole game without killing anyone,  and some of the events and dialog change depending on who and how many you kill.

            @Sky Magic is more neutral than anything,  but it's very existence <em>does</em> disrupt the natural order. I'd say that a personification of order would very much try to destroy magic.

            I like media that has meaning beyond it,  even if it's only on a personal level,  I mean that's how I found this place to begin with. The way media influences is always fascinating,  and how media is influenced,  the chicken,  the egg,  the cycle,  the state of the human condition at the time... So... Fascinating....
<p></p>Right,  order,  what would order look like when not in neutral cube form? If Discord's mosh mash menagerie is meant to represent his chaos,  what creature would represent perfect order?

            @bad Since it's the only place that acts "natural" in all of Equestria,  I'd say it's the perfect example of natural order. Animals taking care of themselves,  weather patterns happening unaided.

            @Storyyeller: I haven't,  but I've read a lot about it (discovered by this wiki in fact) and have considered playing it many times... I just have a weird aversion to playing things on computer,  so I haven't gotten around to it yet.
