            I don't hve it out in front of me to check,  but I don't remember too many deviations offhand.
<p></p>There were a few scenes that showed a small flashback shot of the Hamburg incident,  and I recall that the fight with the troll was much more bloody in the book. Aside from that,  it was mostly the same as the book,  if I recall correctly.

            My completely unrealistic hope is that Trixie uses this as impetus to start throwing herself into it Marisa-style and ends up kicking ass and rivaling Twilight on her own steam.

            Trixie has the attitude,  alright,  but she doesn't have the magical ability to qualify as Marisa. (Unless you count the amulet as a mini-hakkero equivalent,  but then Marisa only uses it for Master Spark,  I think.)
<p></p>Twilight,  on the other hand,  can pick up spells like nobody's business,  and is a bit of an astronomy buff on the side. (Marisa's spellcards are full of stars. My god.) Except her disposition is much closer to Patchouli.
<p></p>Now I kind of hope Trixie is in <em>Fighting is Magic</em>.

            You know who has <em>both</em> those aspects? Rainbow Dash. (And also the rainbow part.)
<p></p>Then again,  she's more like Meiling,  overall.

            That's the thing though.  Hakkero aside,  Marisa didn't get awesome by inheriting some ridiculous artifact or being a prodigy or anything.  She got awesome by <em>working her ass off</em>.  With the right lesson learned,  Trixie could totally do that.
<p></p>I feel like Dash would be more Reimu than Marisa.  Lazy prodigy — CHECK.  Also it means Tank is Genji.
<p></p>Twilight would probably be Alice,  for being a shut-in,  Twixie lulz,  and Smarty Pants as Shanghai.

            I can't help but try to imagine the CMC as the Three Fairies,  except I can think of two fits for Sunny Milk and none for Luna Child.

Someone needs to make a sound clip out of that. Preferably in the voice of Robin Williams.
<p></p>@The amulet: I think the name comes from the shape and the fact it grants great power boost (on par with an alicorn?). It doesn't really mean anyone can use it.

            Ok,  I've finally gotten a chance to watch the episode. Let's go!
<p></p>A mysterious hooded mare enters a old store full of magical artefacts. I can probably guess who that is.
<p></p>Alicorn Amulet? Well,  nothing to do with Sombra then. Still,  this looks interesting. I wonder what the story is with that?
<p></p>Wow,  where did Tri- That mysterious mare get that much cash?
<p></p>An interesting start,  Not out of place in an adventure Film. This episode looks like it could be very good indeed.
<p></p>Note to self. Do not harm Fluttershy's animals. Death will ensure. (Damn,  Flutter's is scary when she wants to be.)
<p></p>So,  Twi appears to be training levitating multiple living objects/entertaining Fluttershy's pets. Spike is right,  she is getting way better with magic,  and she was good to begin with!
<p></p>Saddle Arabia delegates? That would be the horses from the adverts then.
<p></p>And Trixie has returned! And starts up by attacking Rarity with her worst fear. :P
<p></p>And Twi and Trixie instantly hate each other. (Take that,  shippers. ^_^)
<p></p>Snips and Snails still idolise her. They need to pick better role models.
<p></p>Wait,  Trixie just zapped them. Not surprising,  considering they were partly responsible for what happened last time.
<p></p>So,  Trixie is doing this solely as revenge on Twilight. She really holds a grudge,  doesn't she? Though to be fair,  it seems like her whole life was ruined over it. Also,  Rock farm!
<p></p>OK,  Trixie deleting Pinkie's mouth was funny You think the animators got that idea from playing with flash?
<p></p>Well,  it seems like the correct fan interpretation of Trixie is 'The great and powerful jackass' Trixie.
<p></p>Ahh,  Magic Dual! This should be good! It looks like it has set rules to it,  like no harmful attacks on the other caster,  and you lose if you can't counter the opponent's spell.
<p></p>Wait,  What that the Wilhelm Scream? XD
<p></p>Still with the worship,  Snips and snails? You would think they would have learned by now...
<p></p>So,  Twilight can't do an age spell. Not Alicorn levels of power then,  presuming that is what the amulet gives.
<p></p>So,  Trixie places a dome around Ponyville? <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsonsMovie" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsonsMovie">Where has I seen that before?</a>
<p></p>Yay,  Zecora!
<p></p>Wait... ZECORA CAN DO MAGIC?! Well,  she is a zebra,  not a Earth pony... I guess Zebra's have magic powers too.
<p></p>Wow,  Trixie is going full on evil overlord here.
<p></p>Twi:"I just can't stop thinking about Trixie". There we go,  the shippers have something to use. ^_^
<p></p>Fluttershy,  you need to learn to speak up.
<p></p>Wait,  Corrupts the user? Actually,  Considering the red eye flashes,  I should have guessed that...
<p></p>A Fluttershy stealth mission? Yay!
<p></p>Snips and Snails are finally working out that Trixie isn't that great. Took them long enough!
<p></p>Well,  Trixie is nice enough to let beavers though the dome. Also,  Flutters is so in that log.
<p></p>Called it. ^_^
<p></p>Mix your magic,  use the six? Wait,  she doesn't mean the elements of harmony,  does she? But does she mean the stones,  or the bearers?
<p></p>Twi's new amulet is fake,  isn't it?
<p></p>Why is Mayor mare in a cage?
<p></p>OK,  dual two! It seems Twi's plan is to involve the other elements. I guess that means Twi is stronger with the others. Also,  filly AJ and Rarity are cute. :3
<p></p>Wait,  can't Pinkie play ten instruments anyway?
<p></p>Twi Turned AJ into a stallion. No comment. XD
<p></p>Yep,  called it. Twi's amulet was powerless.
<p></p>Oh,  I see,  Twi was simply cheating. That makes sense. Guess Twi isn't stronger with the others. Magically,  anyway.
<p></p>And yep,  Pinkie can still do the impossible.
<p></p>Ah,  On to the display for the Horses.
<p></p>Trixie begs Twi for forgiveness,  and Twi accepts? Looks like the shippers actually got alot to work with after all! Turns out repentant Trixie is the real Trixie after all. Still not humble though. Good. ^_^
<p></p>OK,  I found Trixie falling over when leaving way too funny. XD
<p></p>Ah,  Twilight found the fourth wall! Also,  Pinkie seems to be yelling at the <em>Animators</em> to give her her mouth back.
<p></p>Well,  the episode is over. I loved it. ^-^ Now to read though the thread to see the reactions.

            I have nothing against the plot of FE per se. I even drew <a class="urllink" href="http://callingctulhu.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=24#/d4jqfpi">fanart<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of it. I just dislike the complete HURR GRIMDARK of the setting,  and the atmosphere of the original cartoon barely pokes through. Oh,  and the fucking fucked up fates of the original cast. I mean,  geez louiz.
<p></p>Edit: Oh,  and the gratuitous swearing. I know you have to show that the setting is all Dark and Edgy and stuff,  but when Technicolor ponies drop the F-Bomb in every other conversation,  it becomes kind of jarring.
