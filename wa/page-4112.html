            Okay,  now,  Ginger,  here's the thing about Celestia.
<p></p>She is not a dynamic character. As it stands her defining character trait is being... well,  perfect. She's wise,  kind,  humble,  gentle,  generous,  warm... the list goes on. She has literally no character flaws beyond the occasional bout of trolling,  and even that is normally spun quite positively because ponies always learn a lesson when she does. That's not an interesting character; there's no inherent conflict there. Nobody wants to watch a character being good at stuff for 22 minutes.
<p></p>Now,  if you gave her an episode that showed her with flaws,  she would suddenly become much more interesting,  and probably more popular. Which is an unfortunate catch-22 - she needs focus to get focus - but it's unfortuneately how the fandom works. Why do you think almost all fanon of Celestia is alternate character interpretations? He canon character isn't that exciting. IT <em>could</em> be,  but it isn't currently.
<p></p>He's an interesting idea: An episode focusing on Celestia and Luna,  mainly on Luna. Luna is starting to resent Celestia again,  because Luna is barely scraping by as a leader while Celestia seems so perfect. She keeps trying to one-up Celestia,  or even just be as good as her,  and keeps failing. Until near the end we see Celestia away from all the crowds and she just... breaks down. She drops the act,  or she just drops,  or something like that. BAM! instant new level to Celestia's character,  huge leap in their relationship,  enormous lesson right there.

<p></p>I'm just trying to give you perspective,  Ginger. There's always a reason for something like this,  and sometimes you need to take it into consideration.
<p></p>For what it's worth,  a lot of people probably really like Celestia. Does that mean they want a whole episode about her? I'm sure if one was <em>announced</em>,  people would be excited,  but they wouldn't go looking for one.

            I love Celestia. But I agree with kegisak she is so idealised as the person everypony tries to be =perfect. That she loses a lot of "character coolnes". The letters are the highest proof in that she is what everypony tries to be like.
<p></p>Celestia needs more flaws IMO.
<p></p>Luna is much more flawed and much more relatable even tough she has apperead less than her sister.
<p></p>Still I would be super exited about a celestia episode.

            @kegi I would go looking for a Celestia focus episode,  because I know that the show runners would never air an ep that was just 20 minutes of Celestia being perfect. They would have to flesh her out for it to work. I'll never understand how people could fail to understand that
<p></p>Thing is,  what I respect most about Celestia is her intellect. I like her competence.I wouldn't want an ep focused around her to make her look stupid/incompetent <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">
<p></p>Flawed? Yes. but not incompetence. ANYTHING but incompetence.
<p></p>I think Luna is less interesting because of all her flaws tbh. I feel like an alien

While that would be fun,  it wouldn't be very interesting from a character perspective.

            liking a character is like liking a person it will depend on everyone if you like the character or not but...
<p></p>I have yet to see a fictional character that is deep and interesting without flaws.
<p></p>Celestia is an awesome character. She just needs to be developed more I think and episode about her fighting Discord in a flashback would be awesome for instance.

            That's why I'd prefer it to be a luna/celestia episode. Their dynamic is the most interesting,  because they're foils. They have the same responsibilities,  but very different characters. For example,  Luna is allowed to be imperfect - no one expects her to be perfect after what she did. But Celestia... I could honestly see Celestia envying Luna.
<p></p>The thing you need to understand about people is... consumers are stupid. An individual is reasonable and intelligent,  but you lump them together and everything just goes down the drain. Trust me. My industry pretty much panders to the lowest common denominator as a rule,  because that's the only thing that sells the millions of copies that it takes to actually turn a profit. You can repackage the same game and sell it for nearly two decades straight.
<p></p>It w9ould be nice if that weren't the case,  and you can certainly sell a good chunk of people a very good,  intelligent profit. But when you lump them together the idiots overwhelm them,  and guess who you're suddenly selling to.
