            Well,  no. Spike <em>did</em> steal his possessions,  so the dragon being angry is justifiable (by dragon standards).
<p></p>If you mean he's slightly more justifiable for attacking a baby dragon,  then I don't see how being afraid of Spike's growth spurt has anything to do with it.
<p></p>Edit: OK,  gotcha. What I remember from that episode doesn't really suggest it,  but I'm not trying to argue with you here.

            If he DID suspect that Spike was under the effects of his greed instincts,  what else could he have done about it? Spike showed the capacity to lie convincingly to Twilight in that state,  he could've easily lied to the dragon and told him that he wouldn't come back.

            It certainly puts a lot of the behavior of that dragon in perspective.
<p></p>Actually it probably suggest that despite dragons being intelligent they would probably be to paranoid of each other to really form a society.

            Yes,  the dragons we have seen so far do seem to indicate that they have no society whatsoever. Unless those are the mal-adapted dragons that deliberately live far away from their society.
<p></p>Huh,  I forgot this,  but there not being books on dragons also imply that either normally hatching dragon eggs are not part of Celestia's school's entrance exam or the students are not meant to hatch the egg. Otherwise we'd be seeing more dragons running around and there'd be records on how to raise your dragons.

            It's also possible he was under the effects of rapid aging too - keep in mind he was <em>closer</em> to them than Basil,  but they still didn't know about him. How? He was too small to be a problem before. Basil,  on the other hand,  was old enough that the hormone surge had worn off,  and he was just plain old <em>big</em>.
<p></p>Like,  let's use the 'magical defense to make sure they don't get killed' theory. In that case it's likely that they would also be hyperagressive during these times,  which we saw in spike. They're extremely defensive of their newfound hoard,  and highly terrotoreal. Once they've established thier home and hoard,  the hormones wear off and they set in 'big' mode,  where they're allowed to live as they will,  being able to defende themselves.
<p></p>In other words: Their body goes through a spike in growth which kicks the male instints of aggresion and teriatorialism (as well as probably certain ah,  urges,  as well) into hyperdrive. Once the growth stops the hormones recede,  and the rational mind re-emerges. puberty,  in a nutshell.
<p></p>Basil was an adult. Reggie was a teenager. He just wasn't out of the hormonal part of his growth cycle yet.

            Eh,  I still think Reggie took the most logical (if not a little paranoid) course of action. His home had become a ripe target for this invading dragon,  and judging by how insane Spike went over a BROOM,  and when you consider that Spike goes nuts over gems NORMALLY,  there was no way in hell he was going to just leave that cave of gems,  big dragon guarding it or no. Reggie would be under constant threat

            I picture adult dragons (in this show) as peaceful loners.  If somepony barges into their home,  tells them to get out,  and kicks them in the snout,  though,  they <em>will</em> defend themselves.

            It took basil getting kicked in the face for him to become actually defensive. Most people I know would try and swat a pest the moment it gets inside their home. An make no mistake,  Basil probably didn't give a shit about them off the bat.
<p></p>As for Razorfang/Reggie,  I still hold that he was in the horading process when he attacked spike,  and was thusly not in his right mind.

            I don't think he even knew about it - he only found out when he first woke up,  after all
<p></p>@Ginger: I assume you mean what he could do if her <em>were</em> in his right mind... Well,  his only option were to chase Spike away,  really. Spike had already eater a bunch of his gems,  so he had plenty of reason to assume he had hit hoard-mode. And considering it was probably the equivalent of a winter store,  he needed it. So yeah,  his only real options were to tell Spike to piss off,  or scare him away.
