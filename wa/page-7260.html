<p></p>Well,  if you're comparing Schneizel to that,  don't. Schneizel's downfall was terrible,  but I don't think it would've been impossible to pull off. Schneizel DID have an established weakness. He doesn't play games he has a chance of losing,  and he flees if a situation like that arises.
<p></p>That,  and it was clear to me that while Schneizel had more raw intelligence than Lulu,  Lulu was much more CREATIVE...

            @crow A pet name for Lelouch in the show is Lulu.
<p></p>@kegi Yeah,  most of my sympathy for him came in Storm Of Swords,  when it slowly seems to dawn on Tywin that his family is doomed when he dies. His heirs are incompetent,  his grandson/king is insane AND incompetent,  and he's too overome with irrational rage at Tyrion to think that maybe he could salvage the situation. (and he only hates Tyrion because he inadvertanly killed the only person Tywin ever truly loved)

            I never quite got how Aizen's Zanpakto worked. He didn't seem to need to unlock it to use it,  because his sword never changed. It was explicitly stated that his opponent needed to <em>see</em> the blade for the power to work,  though only once,  and that was why only Ichigo could defeat him... but there seemed to be the implication that there was some big ritual,  otherwise why the fuck didn't he just whip it out on Ichigo and beat his ass into the ground? Not to mention what his Bankai must have been like,  if the shikai was so freaking overpowered.
<p></p>Same goes for the guy who's shikai reverses the senses. Why didn't he go immediately to Bankia while fighting Aizen? Why steel for the less powerful form when you're fighting the most ludicrously powerful opponent in the series? Shonen manga is really stupid sometimes.

And is a shame,  because Tyrion would probably be a good heir. I liked him. He was clever.

            Although Bleach could have ended after Aizen's defeat,  I have to admit that the show/manga has improved drastically since then. Tsukichima was an amazing villain with one of the coolest and most creative powers ever,  and the final arc is shaping up to be great as well.

            @Chad: But why would he? I mean,  it's not exactly looking like the Vizards are coming back,  so why not pull out the stops to make them awesome right there? I'll be forever stuck wondering where the hell they all go to.
<p></p>Granted,  the final arc is looking pretty cool,  so my guess is he's going to pull out all the stops. We get to see all the captains bankais,  in theory.

            Ah,  hype aversion then?
<p></p>I don't know... it might be different in the show. Acting can do a lot for that. Truth told he was simply one of the few character I could connect with. There were other good characters,  of course,  but I liked him simply because he <em>talked</em> through his problems. He never fought,  or threatened; he only used violence one,  and he was bad at it. He <em>schemed</em>. I liked that.
