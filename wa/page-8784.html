Not so fast. The season two finale gave her a brother out of the blue. What's to say she doesn't also have a sister?

            Wait,  there are people who tell you self defense is a <em>bad</em> thing?
<p></p>Heck,  when I was getting picked on I was told self-defense was a <em>good</em> thing. By my parents more or less alone,  admittedly,  who then enrolled me in karate.
<p></p>But still,  who the hell tells someone that fighting back is the wrong thing to do?

            When I went to school... fighting back meant you got suspended right along with the person who started beating you up ... so it wasn't worth it to fight back.  You were just as guilty for defending yourself as the person who attacked you to start with.

            Well there were the teachers at my Primary School,  the playground monitors at my primary school,  the teachers at my secondary school and so on and so forth. If you get bullied the proper course of action is to go to someone about it,  if that is not feasible (perhaps due to being assaulted) then the proper course of action is to allow them to do it and not fight back because then you get in worse trouble.

            most of them don't actually believe the defender should be punished,  they just don't want to deal with pissed off parents screaming that there little angle would NEVER start a fight and so fuck over both kids equally.

            I skipped nursery school after my first day because I found the whole experience strange and terrifying. I just wasn't ready.
<p></p>My grandma had the odd opinion that missing nursery school was the reason I didn't learn to fight.  WTH?

            I was hassled and picked on as a kid too.  Then one day,  I just went for the guy...he won,  but I managed to bust his face up pretty good.  And that started a circle of me just attacking him every time I saw him.  That ended that bulky,  and then one day after i slammed his fingers in a door,  he even tried to turn it around and say I was bullying <em>him!</em>
<p></p>I won that war eventually....got him after school...ripped his face up with my keys.
<p></p>This is were I get my fighty streak from.  I learned by myself that when people hassle you and attack or confront you,  go nuclear.  Always works.

            One time I told someone while the attacking was in progress who proceeded to do nothing. I then got in trouble for punching the person when it was obvious the teacher's sit there and watch approach was going to stop it. I said as much and they didn't have an answer for me.

            Careful with your inner anger,  Apple,  don't fall headlong into the Dark Side. Discretion is the better part of valor,  and I prescribe going assassin/rogue rather than berserker. Revenge is a dish best served with tinfoil-hat-inducing paranoia fuel,  because you never even have to sully your hands with their tainted blood when you can <em>break</em> them with a little trolling.
