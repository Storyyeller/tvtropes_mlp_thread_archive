            If ponies do live really really long lives,  then that would make things easier for Twilight and Spike's friendship,  since their lifetimes might be a little more comparable in length than was previously though (and the same goes for the other girls' friendships with him).

            @ Death:  Because the flashback was mostly black-and-white,  young adult Granny Smith looked like Applejack with braids.  I don't think she had any freckles,  though.

            I agree,  the fact that they are flawed is what makes the ponies so great. It's not a lack of flaws that make characters great and interesting,  it's learning from and overcoming there flaws.

            Would this work?
<p></p>1. Load up a version of "Family Appreciation Day" that's as close as possible to the original colors,  then take screenshots of the present-day Zap Apple at around 13:29 (when it's finished growing) and the flashback Zap Apple at around 18:18 (when it's turned sideways,  to make sure the fade transition is completely finished).
<p></p>2. Try applying different colors to the flashback screenshot until you find the color that makes the Zap Apple look as much as possible like the Zap Apple in the present-day screenshot.
<p></p>3. Take that color and apply it to other flashback screenshots (or even the flashback itself,  if you're good at editing videos) from the same version of "Family Appreciation Day".
<p></p>If this would work,  has it been done yet?

            @Fallen: Hence why I'm ambivalent about her.  On the one hand,  her flaws make her a more interesting character,  but on the other hand,  that specific flaw of hers (lying in order to sustain or gain social status) is a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> for me.  I'm just glad that it IS portrayed as being a flaw within the story (whereas I thought Sweet And Elite made it look like Rarity was at least a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a> when she did the same thing).  I certainly wouldn't want Apple Bloom to be boringly perfect,  though,  and as I said,  I do think it makes an amusing contrast to Applejack being the Element of Honesty.  At least she stood up to Diamond Tiara at the end of the story,  and for that I would cheer for her.
<p></p>Of course,  I'd lay most of the blame on Diamond Tiara for starting the bullying in the first place,  as Apple Bloom probably wouldn't even be as worried about the whole cutie mark thing in general if it wasn't for DT's bullying (and she was perfectly fine with Granny Smith's behavior until Diamond Tiara came and ruined her good mood).  I don't think anyone else was making fun of other ponies for not having their cutie marks yet besides Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon.
<p></p>Thinking about it more makes me pity Apple Bloom rather than be annoyed at her,  as she must really have been desperate to not be bullied,  given the lengths she went to in order to get Granny Smith to not come to school.

            Sure,  nopony flat out called her out on it,  because she never got caught. But that's because the episode didn't need to spell it out for her or us. She realized as she was doing it that it was wrong,  but rationalized away why it was right. And the lying caused her A LOT of extra stress and worry,  all of which turned out to be for nothing,  as her friends would have excepted the truth in the first place.
<p></p>I for one loved that the episode subverted most lying aesops,  by never having her get caught,  yet still showing all the negative effects lying was having on her,  instead of only getting punished because she was caught.

            With types like Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon,  it's either sucking up to them and be their friend,  or be left out of all the cool parties and other events that everyone will be talking about months from now. Seen it happen in my own class.
