            I started watching FIM when the Hub was having a "Mareathon" in April or May of last year.  The first full episode I saw was <em>Winter Wrap Up</em>.

            I remember I started watching the show the week before Cutie Mark Chronicles aired,  since that was the first episode I actually had to wait for.  I remember thinking,  "Wait a minute,  this season <em>hasn't ended yet</em>?!".
<p></p>I also remember I only gave the show a chance after watching the clip of Fluttershy's jazz singing.  I just had to know the context of that scene,  and since I always like to watch stuff in order,  I ended up hooked by the time I got to that episode.

            About Fluttershy being scared of Twilight levitating the animals but being fine with them flying through Ghastly Gorge,  two things I thought of.  One is that she may simply be afraid of the fact that the animals are left to Twilight's mercy and magic,  meaning that Twilight is magically moving them,  whereas with the Gorge race,  the animals in that part were doing it all on their own.  That is,  they were in control of their bodies and their own movements.  Also,  if I remember correctly,  the animals Twilight was moving with TK were generally smaller and probably ones that Fluttershy would worry about,  whereas the ones in the Gorge race,  aside from probably Tank and the bat,  were physically sturdier in general.  Also,  I could be forgetting something,  but weren't all the animals Twilight was levitating all animals that couldn't fly?  Perhaps that factored into Fluttershy's worries as well,  like if Twilight's TK suddenly stopped for some reason and they fell.
<p></p>And about her being afraid to see Zecora,  she probably wasn't afraid of going to Twilight so much that she was afraid of what Trixie might do to her if she was caught,  perhaps?  Or what Trixie might do to her animals as a threat?

            I started watching during the hiatus separating seasons 2 and 3.
<p></p>I was aware of the series almost from the beginning,  and was slightly bewildered as the show's popularity exploded on TV Tropes. Eventually,  I checked out a few fanworks (<em>Camaraderie is Supernatural</em>,  <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Hoofstuck" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Hoofstuck">Hoofstuck</a></em>) because they were crossovers with stuff I already liked,  or they were made by the authors of stuff I already liked. I also absorbed some of the memes purely through internet osmosis.
<p></p>Eventually,  a brony friend of mine started reading <em>Homestuck</em>. Since I had been fanboy-ing over <em>Homestuck</em> at the time,  I figured I should return the favor and give <em>FIM</em> a proper try.

            Rainbow: Fluttershy always seems more hesitant on her own.  I think the prospect of having all her friends' hopes riding on her without any back-up from any of them was a bit much for her.
<p></p>In Return of Harmony,  she had pretty close to a full on panic attack once she was isolated in that hedge maze.
<p></p>And with Stare Master,  she practically broke down in front of the entrance to Everfree.  I think the only thing driving her forward was the possibility of the CMC being in danger getting that inner <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Mama Bear</a> rolling.

            I started watching the show about 2/3rds of the way through the first season,  but I wasn't really active in the fandom much until after the season was over,  mainly because I wanted to watch the whole thing before jumping in and had to play catch up.

            I began watching after Cutie Mark Chronicles.  I think there was like a month break between that one and the next episode,  so there was an extra bit of a wait after I caught up.

            I'd been aware of the fandom literally since the /co/ thread that started it all,  but I never really could give it a shot until Boast Busters (the TV provider I was with at the time didn't offer the Hub on our channel-tier level,  but it was on free preview once and that's how I saw it).
