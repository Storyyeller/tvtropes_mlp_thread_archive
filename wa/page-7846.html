            Anyway,  ramblings on the chapter that I was typing out as I went:
<p></p>Yadda yadda,  here's Littlepip's moral outrage again. I remember last chapter she had a whiny bit when it came to Calamity looting the place,  which seems odd given what I remember about chapter 4.
<p></p>Attempt to be funny discussing trains,  doesn't quite work for me. Calamity has an actual funny bit. Good. Now he's registering as more than "hat and accent."
<p></p>Oh,  there's our drug addiction thing.
<p></p>More blatant typo. "A chuckled at myself,  shaking my head." Who the hell is A?
<p></p>...
<p></p>Time skip to being attacked with a flamethrower? Not that I'm objecting to having the boring action scenes more concise,  but c'mon,  be coherent...
<p></p>Okay,  why do we have things like "Ow. Ow. Ow."? Is this supposed to be past-tense narrative or stream-of-conciousness? Maybe if the narrative was third-person it'd be more appropriate to have interjections like that.
<p></p>Also,  wait - you're waltzing into a slaver town,  with no backup except for a sniper,  and you're shooting shit up? That's... kinda foolhardy,  really.
<p></p>Oh. Next chapter introduces Velvet Remedy proper. Maybe it'll make up for the complete non-impression she left back in the beginning. Kinda a shame - I tend to like pacifist characters and I'm well-aware that this aspect of her characterization doesn't last.
<p></p>Was better than chapter 5,  anyway. Least it didn't take me two different readings a few months apart.

<p></p>You yourself expound how justification can't make you like things. It's just how I feel about it. I,  personally,  do not feel that the setting is believable,  regardless of how it tries to justify it.

            1. Your talking about two differnt sets of ponies with those two
<p></p>2. There's a set of records that goes in great detail just how badly ponies were at handling any sort of long term,  sustained conflict,  let a lone a full out war. Even those that have never been near the front line were starting to get massive PTSD like symptom's just from knowing what was happening. Some even worse. Are they EXACTLY like ponies from the show,  no,  but those ponies haven't gone through at least a decade,  if not more of constant unending warfare,  seeing there society impacted by it more and more every day,  starting to lose hope that it would ever end.....

            Pip and her crew are characterized just fine. Well,  except for some issues I have with Velvet,  but that's not relevant to the topic at hand.
<p></p>My problems are with the chain of events that lead to their characters shattering in tragic ways that I simply do not enjoy reading about. It is only made worse by the flashbacks that quite clearly show that they are still the same characters at heart,  even after years of war,  but their action that we <em>don't</em> see in flashbacks contradict that entirely. Like I said,  I just don't like it.

            yes that helps for novelty,  but even wihtout the Fallout stuff,  the story is just so damn GOOD....and yes as we've said the beginning is the weakest part so not hard to see why your don't really like it so far....and it manages to meld the two almost perfectly. Yes there are a few issues,  but for most people it's not that far past what we could except could happen.
<p></p>is it for everyone? buck no,  if kkat knew how to write a story EVERYONE loved,  she'd wouldn't be putting out fanfic's,  she'd be busy swimming in a country sized money pool. but overall it is a really really well done story that blends two things that shouldn't go together way way better then anyone though possible.

            The early part of the story has no real plot to speak of,  save for "okay,  find Velvet, " which is quickly forgotten until the sixth chapter and then involves a lot of dicking around. Video game crossover is the only real motivation for a reader to look at it where it is so far. If it weren't for that,  would the story have gotten off the ground? Would people have stuck around for what,  eight,  ten chapters for it to get good? I have doubts.
<p></p>And I still don't like Littlepip.

<p></p>Rarity in place of Twilight during finale.
<p></p>Yeah,  when to think about it Hex is really  Disqord.
<p></p>So Megabyte is  Chrysalis - it fitting,  even more in last episodes.
