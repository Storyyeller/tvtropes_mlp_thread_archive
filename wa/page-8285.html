            @Turtlebutter: Eh? Which ponies were in this Wave 2 you ordered from Hasbro? Because I thought the only Blind Bags already released in the USA were Wave 1,  and that's the wave that Hasbro's site sells.

<p></p>Cast of Sonic Satam would be replaced by ponies.  I really want to see small group of pony rebels (and other creatures too) fighting evil cyborg pony and who robotizate everypony and everybody.

<p></p>Now that is an intreasting idea you got their. Would the mane cast play any kind of role in it? And BTW,  if I gave off the inpression that I hated SATAM,  I actually do like it,  it's just that the second season had some pretty big flaws. I actually have the complete series on DVD.

            @Turtlebutter: Most sites only count the 24-pony Blind Bag sets as waves; the box sets (Pony Collection Set,  Friendship Celebration Collection,  Pony Rainbow Collection) and individual releases aren't usually considered waves.
<p></p>Anyway,  BigBadToyStore says that a wave besides Wave 1 is going to be released,  and according to <a class="urllink" href="http://idlehands1.blogspot.com/2012/02/toy-fair-2012-my-little-pony-wedding.html">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> there's going to be another wave besides that one.

<p></p>In my idea it would alternate universe where show  character (or their expy) could showed up in roles inspired by <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatAM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatAM">Sat AM</a> character.  But also that universe could be crossed with with "mane" one. Like ponies from <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatAM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatAM">Sat AM</a> inspired looking for help from FIM world.

            The funny thing is that a few of the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatAM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatAM">Sat AM</a> characters actually mirror the ponies,  albeit a bit more one dimentional (Sonic=Rainbow Dash,  Sally=Twilight Sparkle,  Bunnie=Applejack). It's amusing when the highly saccharine yet complex show about ponies shows how the Dark And Edgy action show could have improved itself.
<p></p>I agree with Marson that a lot of it's problems came during the second season however (though not all of them).
