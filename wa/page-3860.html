            Can we go back to talking about which famous historical figures would have loved MLP?
<p></p>Because no matter what my math teacher said I don't actually think Stalin (who didn't really buy into Communism's principles) would have liked it. It's  far to moral and happy for him. Marx and Lenin on the other hand...

            Yeah FOE takes a few chapters to get good,  I think it was around 20 that it went from good to great,  and really got on track.
<p></p>Also Ginger
<p></p>Yes Watcher is awesome,  even more so once you learn who he is.
<p></p>Ditzy is best pony in FOE.
<p></p>I'll save you a bit of ??'s later,  the only vault that had any ponies from the show in it was Stable 2,  the one Lil'pip is from.
<p></p>And yes the pony you here on the spritebots that isn't Watcher is Red Eye
