<p></p>"The Return of Harmony Part 2": I thought it did have some pacing issues,  but I attribute that more to time constraints than anything else. Overall I found the episode enjoyable.
<p></p>That said,  I <em>do</em> prefer the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a>-style episodes,  and I hope the show returns to that soon,  though that's more a personal preference on my part than anything else.

            I thought it was awesome until Discord grabbed the idiot ball at the end,  and even then it hardly ruins the episode.  It was just a bit of an underwhelming ending.  I'll probably have my overthought review posted tomorrow sometime.

            Highlights from the Jayson Thiessen interview digest linked on Eq Daily:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">•On Lauren's departure: it was personal reasons. Which is to say she just up and told everyone she was burning out,  and she withdrew right at the top of her game. It was a huge surprise to everybody,  and nobody saw it coming,  but they all respected her decision. The upshot is that there weren't any creative disagreements or corporate politics involved,  it was just something she felt she had to do; and she'd mind-melded with Jayson and the rest of the team enough by then that they basically have all the handle on where she wanted to go with it that they need. (I wish I knew why nobody's thought to ask about this subject directly in prior interviews. It's clearly Lauren's story to tell,  but it's nothing that sensitive or mysterious.)
<p></p>•Jayson really understands by this point why it is that we dudes all fell in love with the show: that it gave us an excuse to ditch all the poisonous,  self-perpetuating cynicism and bile that we'd become used to throwing around at the world and each other,  and to just appreciate something sweet and beautiful because it was objectively good enough that we didn't have to feel weird about it if we didn't choose to. He mentioned that there are times when he's reviewing a story and he feels himself start to get choked up over a particularly emotional moment,  or to feel himself getting carried away by something as gorgeous as the meteor shower scene (I suggested that,  he didn't bring it up himself—I must confess I probably did as much talking as he did; let's all feign surprise),  and he says he really understands in those moments what the show means to us,  how we must all feel. He gets it.
<p></p>•By that same token,  he's adamant about not changing the show to suit "our" tastes; he firmly believes that if the show exactly as it is is what we fell in love with,  then by God they're going to keep making that show. (Whenever some fan in the audience would ask some dumb question about "hey are you gonna put some <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs">O Cs</a> of high-profile fandom contributors in the background?",  the rest of the crowd would shout him down or cheer when Jayson said no.)</div>

            It did seem weirdly paced to me too.
<p></p>You know I would have been disappointed by Discord's quick defeat about two years ago,  though I quickly deduced that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he convinced himself he was invincible.</span>
<p></p>As for other things I was rather amused by Rarity's kung-fu defense of "<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallItVera" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallItVera">Tom</a>" and full-on mean Fluttershy. Also I almost cried when Twilight corrupted herself.

            I still wonder if Discord lied and never actually got his hands on the Elements of Harmony,  but one thing he knew that Princess Celestia didn't was that the Elements naturally gravitate to the home of their current user.  So,  knowing that Twilight would eventually find the Elements no matter what he did,  Discord made up that riddle to stall the gang long enough to mess with their minds and render them incapable of using their harmony powers.
<p></p>I'm also not that eager to hear Discord sing a song anymore,  since I can only imagine it being <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4g6-uKVQM#t=9m29s">Give Me Chaos<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> over and over again.

            I just had a thought. You know how Twilight and Co. were only able to re-seal Discord,  despite being the ones to wield the Elements at their full potential?
<p></p>Well,  I think that <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess"> Celestia and Luna <em>were</em> able to wield the Elements at their full potential when they fought Discord. Key words being <em>"and Luna"</em>. The two sisters knew each other so well,  and they really did love each other,  such that they could use the Elements as they were meant to be used. However,  when Luna became Nightmare Moon,  Celestia alone couldn't use them as she once could when she was joined with her sister. All she could do was to seal Nightmare Moon into the moon; a prison that could not last forever,  as she thought Discord's prison would. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">
<p></p>In other words,  the stone prison was the absolute best the Elements can do to Discord,  and they were at the top of their game both times they were used on him.
