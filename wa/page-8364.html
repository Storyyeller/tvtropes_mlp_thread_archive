            Hello,  thread that moves too fast for me to properly partake in,  I'm here to offer my two cents about the Derpy toy.
<p></p>I'm actually surprised they're releasing her as the Comic Con exclusive. They normally have artsier designes,  while Derpy looks kinda plain in comparison. Does this mean Derpy won't appear in the main toyline now? Will she get a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheScript" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheScript">little card with her name on it</a>,  ending the Ditzy/Derpy name debate once and for all?!?
<p></p>Isn't this also suppose to be the 30th anniversary of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a>? Wouldn't it be better to rerelease a G1 pony as the Comic Con exclusive? Why does the Derpy toy fill me with questions and not rejoicing?

            Unsympathetic,  for sure. But it's fascinating. Roxie Hart <em>looks</em> completely innocent,  and she tries to play up the act of a "frightened girl, " of an innocent,  unassuming person who made a mistake and wants nothing more than for everything to turn out alright. But in reality she's just as base,  manipulative,  and self-serving as any of the other inmates,  as Mama Morton,  Billy,  or Velma. She's just so completely two-faced,  and I just find that makes a great piece of viewing.
<p></p>Amos Hart,  on the other hand,  is dumb,  and in his first scene he's a bit of a jerk. He's a flawed person,  but he's just so sincere about everything he does that it's completely heartbreaking how Roxie uses him for her own gain.

The Alliance isn't blackly evil,  and a lot of it is Mal being sore that he lost the war. The main point is that the Alliance is controlling everything,  while Mal and his crew feel that people should be free to make their own mistakes.

            I've enjoyed most of the Joss Whedon stuff I've seen - Dr. Horrible,  Firefly,  Toy Story,  The Avengers. I'm not exactly a huge Whedon fan,  but if nothing else,  the guy can do funny dialogue.

            @Calnos I think you're letting overactive cynicism suppress the joy you should be feeling. The name caused problems,  so they're not going to officially name her,  most likely. Not that it matters,  though,  because we know what her name is. As for the anniversary,  it's more of a celebration of where they've made it to rather than where they've been.

            Yeah,  he was one of the writers for the original <em>Toy Story.</em>
<p></p>Admittedly,  I'm not quite as enamored with <em>Firefly</em> as a lot of people. It really isn't quite your usual sci-fi thing,  which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But in a case like that you enter into it expecting a long plot arc,  when it generally consists of a series of standalone misadventures,  very loosely tied together by Mal's backstory and the River and Sam plot. It's mostly about looking at this ragtag bunch of misfits,  and while they make for interesting characters,  even if it hadn't been <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a> I kinda wonder how long it would've lasted.

            @Purple Everyone has their own pet peeves,  so I can see why you wouldn't like his stuff. I need to start digging around for some tropes I don't like,  because I've become a bit too accepting of media recently.
<p></p>Also,  <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8omJvCrwRdY">Hero of Canton<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is a great song.
<p></p>Question about the Avengers: Who was the red guy after the credits? I thought it was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Red Skull</span>,  but it didn't look too much like him.

<p></p>One thing I liked about Firefly was the general aesthetic. Space cowboys is a cool idea.
