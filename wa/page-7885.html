            You really don't need that much strategy for most RPG's. I mean,  I've found in most games you can get by by spamming attack.
<p></p>I'd recommend the Tales series,  though - it's got an action combat system,  so there's really no strategy involved,  and it's got really good(If somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries">japanese</a>) stories.

I found the regular enemies (not all of them,  but at least certain types) actually pretty challenging throughout the game,  and used strategy on nearly all battles.  Maybe it's because you only use the same characters.  That would make them probably a LOT higher level than my team,  since I religiously trained every party member up to the same level.  Also,  you're play time was a lot higher than mine.  Yeah,  that's it.</span>

            You know what I've noticed about CEQ? Despite all of Twilight's power,  she's actually been the least useful in both the fights agsinst the Mean Six so far. She couldn't even touch Grayscale,  and all she accomplished agsinst Starlight was severely injuring them both.

            @JT I don't hate them,  I just hate feeling like I'm missing half the fucking game by not spending days of my life grinding levels to become strong enough.
<p></p>and the fact that I'm NOT a strategist... at all. I can't think conservatively or cunningly.
<p></p>Again,  I always feel stupid when a game expects me to think like that.
<p></p>Hence why I'll never EVER EVER EVER <strong>EVER</strong> play RTS games

            Yeah,  that'll probably do it Blue. I kept my single team the whole way through. I didn't tend to grind though,  I usually have them at about <em>exactly</em> the right level. Like,  I'm at level 70-ish right now.
<p></p>I still found the monsters challenging,  and there are certainly times when I found it was in my best interests to be using more advanced strategies - I try to keep one stat persona in my team at all times for that reason - but for the most part it's just a matter of finding the weaknesses and using them for VIOLENCE. You do that,  and everything's easy.

Twilight consistently panics in a dangerous situation,  often completely forgetting that she has a spell on hand that would solve the situation.

            @Swasfew,  well from my perspective I technically didn't care much for them but they were all evil and competent and destructive and made you work hard for your victory. I mean I can't recommend the games any more than that  because I like the game for reasons independent of the villains.
