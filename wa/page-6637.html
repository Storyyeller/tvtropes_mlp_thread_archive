            we saw that it took ALOT of effort and energy just to reinforce the spell,  probably took a lot of preperation to actually put it up,  even if he wasn't MC'ed doubt he could have held it up against a determined assault for long before he was exhausted.

            It's most likely that; the Queen taking out both Luna and Celestia working together would have put her on a different level entirely,  and made Cadenza and Armor's victory less believable.

            Maybe she was setting up the moon for night-time? She's (presumably) not as strong as her sister,  so she might need to go to the moon to get everything ready while Celestia can just use her magic?

            <em>Fillies and Gentlecolts</em>! The Royal wedding has been a huge success<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKXlhpeb6wI">according to most<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></div></span>,  and now,  season two has been officially wrapped up. It is time for us to determine just who is <em>Best Pony Season Two</em>!
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="../wa/page-1989.html#post-49701">Here are the results of last time<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. This time,  40 Tvtropes bronies have voted,  which is a pretty major increase compared to last time's 24. Well,  what can I say,  there will always be more bronies every day,  and it seems that we've gained 16 since then. It is good to see the message of love,  tolerance and quality entertainment hasn't failed to reach out to more and more people.
<p></p>Now,  let us get to the main event: we will now announce the official ranking,  as well as <em>Best Pony Season Two</em>!
<p></p><ul><li> <strong>#6: Rainbow Dash</strong>,  with 4 votes for first,  4 x second and 3 x third,  gaining a total of 45 points. Season two hasn't been particularly good to Rainbow Dash. While everyone knows her as the local <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>,  episodes like <em>May The Best Pet Win</em> or <em>The Mysterious Mare-Do-Well</em> seemed to focus to much on the 'jerk' part. While <em>Hurricane Fluttershy</em> did a good job in redeeming her,  it was not enough to save her from the lowest rank. Relatively speaking. We hope to see her do better next time.
</li><li> <strong>#5: Pinkie Pie</strong>,  with 2 votes for first,  3 x second,  13 x third,  for a total of 58 points. Ponyville's biggest party-animal was finally allowed to show of her personality in a way that didn't involve parties in <em>Baby Cakes</em>. While people still seem reluctant to give her the top spot,  she definitely managed to win a special place in our hearts.
</li><li> <strong>#4/3: Applejack</strong>,  who was given 5 votes for first,  7 x second and 6 times third,  which adds up to 71 points. Poor Applejack never seems to be given the spotlight for herself; even on these rankings,  she now has to share the third/fourth place with some other pony for the second time in a row. She's nothing if not consistent. Her lack of obvious character flaws makes for little interesting television,  but we as a whole appear to admire her dependable personality. Applejack may not be the most entertaining pony,  but she posses a character that we should all strive for.
</li><li> <strong>#4/3: Fluttershy</strong>,  with 3 votes for first,  8 x second and 8 x third,  gaining her 71 points. Last time's runner-up will now have to be satisfied with sharing the bronze. While she is most certainly still very cute,  we got to see very few new depths to her character this season,  which might explain why her dropping in the rankings. That said,  she is still a fan-favourite,  and competition was tight. Despite her lowered ranking,  anyone that dares to say anything bad about her will still be lynched within seconds.
</li><li> <strong>#2: Rarity</strong>,  being given top spot 10 times,  second place 6 times and third place 8 times,  for a total of 98 points. Quite a few people have said something along the following lines: "X is best pony,  but Rarity gets the best episodes". <em>Sisterhoof Social</em> and <em>Sweet and Elite</em> are indeed some of the more touching stories that still managed to be funny. This,  combined with her excellent capacity for Ham even when she's not the main character,  makes her one of the most entertaining and well-rounded characters in pretty much all of animation this decade. Brava,  my lady,  brava!
</li><li> <strong>#1: Twilight Sparkle</strong>,  with a whopping 16 votes for first,  in addition to 10 votes for second and 6 for third,  winning <em>Best pony</em> once again by a landslide with 138 points. Was there ever any doubt? Twilight Sparkle,  the nerdy yet lovable prodigy,  is someone that tropers such as ourselves can identify with. Despite her bookish nature,  she showed a capacity for some crazy as well,  which made her all the more endearing. There is no doubt about it. Tvtropes has spoken: Twilight Sparkle is <em>Best Pony Season Two</em>.
</li></ul><p></p>So what do we do now? Well,  we bide our time,  I suppose. The next season won't be here fopr a long time,  but bronies will still be bronies. There will be fanart,  fanfiction,  conventions and whatever else. The internet is a great place,  and ponies made it even better. We eagerly await season three.
<p></p>Have a good hiatus. Bronies forever!

            Couldn't see the first episode at airing time,  so watched both just now.
<p></p>And what to say ? What to say ? <em><strong>THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE A SEASON FINALE,  THAT'S WHAT TO SAY !</strong></em>
<p></p>Everything. This. Finale. Had. EVERYTHING.
<p></p>Cool,  manipulative villain. Epic battle. Adorable flashbacks. Great songs. Derpy cameo. Vinyl's return. Luna's return (only at nighttime,  but that's actually quite logical). Celestia trying to protect her subjects (and the Changeling Queen's reaction shows that she <em>should</em> have won if her enemy wasn't powered by <em>the love of two ponies about to get married</em>. That's like the pony equivalent of being powered by freaking <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superman" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superman">sunlight.</a></em>). DRAMA. And still pretty damn funny (Cadence dancing with Pinkie killed me <em>TWICE</em>).
<p></p>That's the best thing ever and I'm so bucking happy right now I have a hard time not to scream my joy all the way back to Earth.

            I had horrifying,  horrifying reminders of G3 when I saw Twilight's flashback with foalsitter Cadence. It might have something to do with that ponytail mane and magical ability to "spread love".
