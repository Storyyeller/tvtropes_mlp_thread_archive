            a helm with visor could work,  especially if they are pretending to be a royal messanger.  They could have knocked out a real messenger and taken it from them.  I would imagine a messanger would have some sort of official uniform that would include a helm or hat of some type.

            @Ginger She could also hide her condition using illusions,  since she's a unicorn. You could even drop hints by having the illusions be imperfect and having others notice something just a little off that they can't quite place.

            I would hazard to guess that the 10 minute restriction is about a week give or take a few days.  TB was created last Friday so she has a few more days to go before I can use her fully.
<p></p>I was originally going to use her only for IC OC posts but I think Ill just always be semi-IC since she's just an extension of my own self.

            @Ginger - most unicorns have a specific spell type that they are powerful in from what I understand.  They all learn basic levitation but then tend to specialize in one type after that.  Maybe she specializes in illusions and used those extensively to lure and distract the dragons she fought?

            Survival may be her talent but she probably has a spell class that goes along with it.  Illusion could be what helps her to stay alive,  and that would be useful elsewhere such as hiding her odd appearance.

            @Ginger Camouflage is a huge part of surviving in an extremely dangerous environment,  so I would hope she would be able to conjure up a small illusion like that. Otherwise she would have to overpower a lot of predators directly,  which would require a lot more power than simple illusions.

            Well,  her odd appearance isn't directly related to her (as in,  it's not what she natrually looks like)
<p></p>@Crow Mostly offensive magic,  I was thinking teleportation too...
<p></p>She's supposed to have become really strong after surviving for 8 years in a hostile environment

            Well,  you don't beat dragons in contests of strength. I'd still say that illusion is practically a required skill for a survivalist in an environment filled with predators straight out of the Monster Manual.

            It really depends on how the character has survived.  If she needed to be sneaky,  then having illusion spells makes perfect sense.  If she survived by becoming a badass that beats up her enemies,  then she probably wouldn't have developed that sort of spell.
