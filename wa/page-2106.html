This. One could understand Rarity not knowing before,  but for what she said to snap Spike out of his greedy rampage <em>when everything else failed</em> would make it pretty obvious to her.

            The only time she lost it was when her cape got ruined.

            That,  and it might be a straw that broke the camels back sort of thing.  Not to mention that she might not just be worried about the fashion,  but about the fact that he ruined something that she put a lot of time and effort into making.  It's a lot easier to get worked up over something that you've personally worked on than the destruction of something more valuable that you don't have any personal stock in.  That and the fact that Ponyville gets wrecked on a regular basis,  so everypony is probably covered by Disaster Insurance or something.

            Just noting that in my review,  I actually compared Spike's thing to puberty,  with his hoarding urges being comparable to the sex drive of a teenager.  Because he's adolescent,  he has issues controlling it,  which is why the older dragons have hoards of stuff that's actually valuable. They still have the urge to gather stuff,  but because the impulse isn't running rampant,  they can pick and choose what they hoard rather than grabbing all the things.

            Or in other words,  Death,  you're a genius. A flipping genius.
<p></p>So guys,  I've been going over the fanon sheet,  waned to know what you thought of this for Detective Inspector and Inspector Detective:
<p></p>Detective Inspector
<p></p>Gender: Male
<p></p>Species: Unicorn
<p></p>Cutie Mark: Magnifying Glass
<p></p>Occupation: Investigator of Ponyvile.
<p></p>Relationships: Rival of Inspector Detective
<p></p>Abilities: Skilled at finding evidence.
<p></p>Personality: Very meticulous in his observations,  very organized and orderly,  and likes thins to be clean. Obsessed with the proper order of details making him fantastic at finding evidence but terrible in social situations. Is potentially a better detective than Inspector Detective but is so plagued by his obsessive needs he isn’t taken seriously.
<p></p>Inspector Detective
<p></p>Gender: Male
<p></p>Species: Earth Pony
<p></p>Cutie Mark: An Eye
<p></p>Occupation: Analyst of Ponyville.
<p></p>Relationships: Rivals with Detective Inspector. EXPANSION NEEDED.
<p></p>Abilities: Very good at using traditional methods to analyse evidence.
<p></p>Personality: Disorganised almost to the point of being highly distracted. A little hyper and tends to not respect others. However he is highly observant and tends to make a big deal out of finding information no one else has. However he is highly charismatic and great in conversation.  Is potentially a better detective than Detective Inspector but is so childish he isn’t taken seriously.

            @Rich: Probably somewhere in the middle.  She's basically letting him know that she knows,  and wants to spare him the awkwardness.  I don't think she reciprocates,  but she's at the very least letting him know that she doesn't dislike him because of it.

            ^Yeah,  definitely.  Spike's seemed to treat his crush on Rarity as almost something to be ashamed of,  and I think Rarity was telling him that he didn't have to be afraid of her finding out.
<p></p>Very generous of her.
