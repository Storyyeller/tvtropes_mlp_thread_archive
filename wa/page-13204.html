            True,  but the entire point of the episode was that fluttershy fear came from being mocked as a kid. I can´t relate to that but I can relate to RD fear of not living to people expectations better (best part of the Mare-do-well episode)
<p></p>Either way I like apologize a lot Fluttershy a lot better that traumatized Fluttershy so for me its a tie between Stare Master or Phoot Finish episode. I miss those days,  the "were we arguing?" Fluttershy moments. I can´t recall a moment where she apologized on season 3.

            Well,  I <em>was</em> bullied. I was also emotionally abused (physically too,  actually,  but that was far less common).
<p></p>That said,  I did identify with RD's fear in Sonic Rainboom,  just less than I usually identify with Fluttershy.

            Sorry to hear that.
<p></p>I only had to deal with one bully in second grade and the issue was solved in a second when I told my parents. While I consider my high school years boring I never had problems with bullies. Even a kid that used to bother me in thrid grade became my best friend when we reached high school so I just can´t relate to that. Sorry I always look like an asshole for being unable to understand bully episodes. I was even on Babs side during her episode but maybe because how cute she looked the entire time. A stupid reason I guess.
<p></p>Still I like Fluttershy better when her kindness gets in the way just like in Sonic Rainboom,  I laughed so hard at her attemps to "cheer" RD. I´m talking when they reached Cloudsdale as she is making her even more nervous.

<p></p>But not here.
<p></p>That said,  I do have the problems with not living up to people's epectations as well. A lot of people thought that I was a genius for some reason. Which is ridiculous. I'm intelligent,  but I'm nowhere near a genius. I've <em>met</em> people who are probably geniuses and their intellect can be intimidating. There's also trying to live up to my father. My first ponyfic is actually heavily inspired by my relationship with my father.

            I suppose I identify with Fluttershy a bit,  but more the loving animals thing,  and maybe a bit of the shyness. However,  I generally identify more with Twilight Sparkle.
<p></p>Bullying? I was bullied a bit in school,  I suppose,  though not to anywhere near the degree that someone like me might normally be bullied. It was sort of weird,  I think somehow I managed to get "accepted" in an odd way by the kids who would normally bully someone like me and they put out the word to leave me alone.
