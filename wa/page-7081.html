            I think the Mane Cast's actions <em>could</em> have been justified if they had given it more build up,  but the fact that they jumped right to "let's be superhero" rather than trying to talk her down first it could have worked.  And I don't think it was quite <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>; It's not like they were intentionally trying to embarrass her or anything,  they just wanted her to stop having such a big head about it.  That and they didn't really realize how nuts it was making her.

            Their intent wasn't to humiliate her,  and they weren't aware that she felt humiliated.  Keep in mind that the Mare Do Well <em>never</em> set her up for failure.  All they did was step in when her ego caused her to screw up.  Any humiliation suffered was her own fault for trying to drum up applause when she should have been doing something useful.

            I agree with J Teeth on this,  if there was a scene of them taking a more reasonable approach to calming RD down and she blew them off,  then I wouldn't have had a problem with their plan.  I still might have taken issue with how weird Ponyville was in that episode,  but it wouldn't have bothered me as much.

<p></p>Eh,  I personally tend to Headcanon that,  along with that one:
<p></p>Dragon Quest <br>A Friend in Deed <br>Mystery on the Friendship Express <br>and Putting Your Hoof Down
<p></p>didn't really happen either.  Not only because I don't like them but because they all have major things that don't really mesh with the established Ponyverse (non-Pony species having capitalist cultures and integrating with ponies being one of the big things).

            I'm voting Dragon Quest out next.  The other dragons got too much screen time,  and it didn't really answer any questions about Spike.

            I JUST realized who Shining Armor's voice actor is. He's Murata Azrael of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GundamSEED" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GundamSEED">Gundam SEED</a> fame. I'd link to video of him lounging around giving orders to have an entire race of people wiped out with nuclear weaponary while laughing giddily,  but I can't find one.
