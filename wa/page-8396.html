            Well,  I like the fanon that other countries are ruled by creatures of Royal Sister level power.
<p></p>But for most fanfics,  I just like to assume that she's too busy to get involved.

            @Bad To be fair,  I think it's pretty unfair to criticize a story that was written BEFORE something happened in canon which retconned it.
<p></p>Such an occurance does not instantly make the writing bad.
<p></p>It'd be like criticizing Progress because Luna was acting OOC in it (just an example,  I might be wrong. I haven't read the fic)

            I like that fanon as well. It also serves as a good explanation as to why the sisters wouldn't just take the field to instantly end any conflict,  cause then the other leaders would need to step in to protect their subjects and with all that power flying around massive damage would occur.

            Yeah,  what Ginger says. If Star Swirl shows up in canon and is all cheerful and well-adjusted,  I'll have problems,  but I can't really be criticised for that.

            Oh,  I know it all happened pre-season 2. I'm not able to separate characterization though,  so it still will bother me forever.
<p></p>If we want to talk about a different reason as for why I don't like the fic's setting,  the Zebra rational in general is so bizarre and nonsensical that I can't even begin to figure it out,  but the setting's mere existence hinges on it.

            They had no reason to believe she was still evil. The Ponies were heavily involved in trade with their nation,  but apparently knew <em>nothing</em> about this cultural quirk. The Zebras had advanced sciences to the point that mysticism should not have been able to sway an entire nation to be willing to commit MAD to end a threat they hadn't even confirmed to be a threat. I could go on forever,  here,  if I wanted to.

Even those that thought Luna meant well,  still knew she had been touched by The Stars and saw her at best as an unwitting pawn of them. They didn't have to believe she was evil,  just that she was being controlled/influenced (even without her knowing) by <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>'s that wanted nothing but to spread misery and pain.

            But still,  the zebras were apparently just pretending nothing was wrong for years after Luna returned,  with not a single pony (not even Celestia herself,  apparently? How does that even work?) aware of one of the largest tenants of Zebra culture? Celestia should have been able to diffuse the situation immediately upon Luna's return.

            and again,  Littlehorn was the first time that Ponies had attacked FIRST,  I believe. Against underarmed forces.
<p></p>This happened at LUNA'S school. And after it happened,  LUNA took charge of the war effort.
<p></p>If you were already deathly afraid and suspicious of her,  tell me that wouldn't set off some serious warning bells

            Wait,  ANYTHING related to the stars was an Eldritch Abomination in their eyes?  So... they had no problem with the alicorn who happened to have direct control over the closest star?

I'll still 8e around the forums,  so send me a PM if you need me or if anything really cool happens... 8ut until then,  I guess this is good8ye.  It's 8een great,  folks.
