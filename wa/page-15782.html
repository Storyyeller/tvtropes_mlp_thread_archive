            Huh,  the last PSA I watched was one for drugs. Yeah big shock,  it involved these creepy like stop motion humans for the entire thing. <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PSAs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PSAs">PS As</a> the over the top messages to kids,  "Hey kids,  smoking is wrong but our trippy <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PSAs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PSAs">PS As</a> are a-okay to broadcast on kids TV!"

            The only drug PSA I ever remembered was when they brought the doctors in to show us the <strong>really</strong> extreme effects of cigarette smoke. Like the guy who had to have half his face removed because of mouth cancer.

            @picture of desk Diamond Tiara: How did THAT happen?!  However,  I can imagine a scenario where Diamond Tiara's bullying causes Sweetie Belle to rage so much that she has a burst of uncontrolled magic and accidentally melds Diamond Tiara with a desk.  I was also going to suggest Rarity doing it to her in revenge for bullying her sister,  but Rarity would be more likely to use the gossip circles to get out the word that Diamond Tiara is a bully so that she would get a taste of her own medicine (since she tends to use verbal bullying more than physical).
<p></p>@who started the cheese in the thread: Unless I'm forgetting something or it started before I joined the thread,  the main time I remember discussions of cheese first starting to pop up was when a recipe book mentioned Luna's Glorious Grilled Cheese and it got people talking about the kinds of cheeses they would like to use in their sandwiches. (by the way,  I'm just glad that Luna and I have a similar favorite food!)

            I still think the hilarious thing about that recipe isn't the fact that it's Glorious Grilled Cheese,  it's the fact that if you follow it to the letter you end up with enough sandwiches to feed like five people.

<p></p>Yes,  but it was NES mentioning cheese in every post for a while that got people to start saying the thread was about cheese.

Maybe some kind of thing for pegasi at flight school about not flying while doing something distracting.
<p></p>The show hasn't dealt with real-life drugs (aside from some of the implications of the cider episode because of the way it was drawn as looking foamy),  but they do have things like using the Heart's Desire to get a cutie mark that caused Apple Bloom to get the Cutie Pox,  or plants that do weird things like the poison joke that they would need to know to watch out for,  like how people are taught how to spot poison ivy and how to avoid it.

            @Story: I don't even remember that. What I <em>do</em> remember was a few posts about cheese being posted to the Insane Pony Thread tumblr,  which resulted in us joking about people who follow it thinking that we talk about cheese a lot,  which derailed into us actually talking about cheese.  And then it basically became a self-fulfilling running joke that we talk about cheese a lot.
<p></p>Speaking of which,  I'm just going to remind everybody to keep adding posts to the IPT document,  and if you have time,  to make new images and pm them to me or CDRW. The tumblr itself has been a bit neglected for the past 2 weeks.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Relatedly,  it's my headcanon that "Pegasi damage insurance" is a thing in Equestria to pay for damage caused by pegasi crashing or dropping stuff. Premiums go up if your house if you leave near a major shipping lane,  or if you live in the same town as Rainbow Dash.
<p></p>Monster insurance is also a thing. It's how the town recovers so quickly after stuff like the parasprite invasion and Spike's rampage.

            <div class="quoteblock"> I don't even remember that. What I do remember was a few posts about cheese being posted to the Insane Pony Thread tumblr,  which resulted in us joking about people who follow it thinking that we talk about cheese a lot,  which derailed into us actually talking about cheese. And then it basically became a self-fulfilling running joke that we talk about cheese a lot.</div>
<p></p>I don't remember that. I assumed that NES started it.
