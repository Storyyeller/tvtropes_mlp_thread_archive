<p></p>Um anyhow,  well good for your Applelight,  perhaps good ones do exist out there but I have been to like 5 schools and had different Gym teachers almost every year and pretty much every single one was a douchebag.

            I think it's a good hypothesis,  Applelight.  Of course,  I can't see that system existing without measures to ensure the exiled ponies are honest  in their repentance  for their crimes.
<p></p>I'm sad to see gym teachers so demonized.  I actually had a few good ones who weren't massive brutes and actually cared for their students.

The rest ranged from indiffernte to anyone not on there choosen extra curicular activity teams,  to total douchebag to anyone not a profession athlete,

            Well when you consider that their job is trying to get a pack of lazy teenagers to get active... you could hardly blame a cat herder for being a bit irate most of the time,  now could you?
<p></p>My gym teachers could be gruff and harsh,  but not of them were jerks(Although if you were to ask anyone else who had them,  it might be a different story). They just have one of the more unpleasant jobs,  so they sort of need to be a bit... forceful,  sometimes.

            Well given how unrepentantly BAD a pony would have to be..that type really doesn't seem like the type that could effectively fake an apology,  and I'm sure Celestia would be extremely trusting if they said they'd learned there lesson,  but she'd keep an eye on them to make sure they ACTED like they'd learned as well.
