<p></p>Dude... They weren't depressed because of the shadows. They were depressed because <em>all they'd ever known</em> was a life of misery,  slavery and fear at the hands of an extremely powerful tyrant who made absolutely sure that they were so afraid of him,  thy would never dare look for anything in his castle!
<p></p>Are you telling me that you'd be aball of sunshine in those circumstances?
<p></p>As for adventure episodes being worse than slice of life ones,  I have to look at A Canterlot Wedding,  The Return of Harmony and It's About Time and say "no".

            I really didn't like 'It's About Time',  though.  I mean,  I've never been a fan of those episodes that have Twilight taking something too seriously (even in the S3 opener,  I wanted to kind of facepalm because she kept being more concerned about the 'test' rather than about saving the empire.  Even when she'd,  y'know,  helped defeat the third ancient evil to return in as many years (Chrysalis not being ancient),  she was still worried.  It's in-character,  but spending an entire episode full of dramatic irony isn't much fun.

<p></p>Their appearance is the symptom,  not the cause.
<p></p>Now,  of course,  my tastes aren't going to be identical to anyone else's,  but,  we once made lists of how we'd tier the episodes. This is mine,  based on my own enjoyment,  from best tier at the top:
<p></p>Canterlot Wedding,  Hurricane Fluttershy,  Lesson Zero,  Return of Harmony,  It's About Time,  Suited For Success,  Green Isn't Your Color,  Hearth's Warming Eve,  Luna Eclipsed
<p></p>Bridle Gossip,  Cutie Pox,  Dragonshy,  Party of One,  Read It and Weep,  Baby Cakes,  Sonic Rainboom,  Swarm of the Century,  Cutie Mark Chronicles,  Stare Master,  The Crystal Empire
<p></p>Sweet and Elite,  Hearts and Hooves Day,  Secret of My Excess,  Best Night Ever,  Winter Wrap Up,  Family Appreciation Day,  May the Best Pet Win!,  Boast Busters,  Putting Your Hoof Down,  Friend in Deed,  Friendship is Magic
<p></p>Bird in the Hoof,  Sisterhooves Social,  Dog and Pony Show,  Ponyville Confidential,  Last Roundup,  MM Mystery on the Friendship Express,  Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,  Dragon Quest,  Mysterious Mare Do Well,  Feeling Pinkie Keen
<p></p>Show Stoppers,  Call of the Cutie,  Owl's Well That Ends Well,  Look Before You Sleep,  Applebuck Season,  Ticket Master,  Fall Weather Friends,  Griffon the Brush Off,  Over a Barrel
<p></p>EDIT: <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Well,  as I said,  my tastes will be different. Personally,  that's part of what makes Twilight my favourite character and so lovable and identifiable and interesting and yes,  fun.

            Maybe (thats my headcanon) Crystal Ponies are seperate breed of ponies,  not earth ponies,  dont have EP powers  and abilities and have their own race powers + abilities.  So we don't see Crystal Pegasuses and Unicorns because there are no Earth Ponies either.

<p></p>This is what I think too
<p></p>EDIT:<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Sisterhooves Social makes me uncomfortable and therefore unable to enjoy it as much. It's well written,  but when you've had bad experiences with your own family,  it's a bit triggery. A Dog and Pony Show is good when Rarity is on screen,  <em>especially</em> in the imagine spots,  but the rest of the episode felt lackluster to me.

            I haven't taken the time to quantify which episodes I like <em>least</em>,  but my absolute faves are Sisterhooves,  Hurricane Fluttershy,  Sonic Rainboom,  and all the 2-parters so far. Also Read 'em and Weep.
