<p></p>No,  learning Python is. I only suggested Javascript because it's the best for small scale game development.

            @ Kyler:  The problem with Flash is that this is the extent of his development:  "I'm a cute high school student who plays guitar.  I'll be super-nice to the new girl so she'll dance with me."

<p></p>The thing is that Flash Sentry feels like something that was forced in by <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> and they made him as minor as they could get away with. So taking out of the story really does make sense.

            So,  I just finished reading the Pinkie Pie microseries comic. I was planning on going this saturday but a coworker invited me out to a comic shop over lunch,  and it turns out he and I go to the same one.
<p></p>-ahem-
<p></p><a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEHEEHEEHEE" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEHEEHEEHEE">Eeeeeeeeee EEEEEEEEEEEEHEEHEEHEE</a>! Holy crap I loved this comic! It was <em>fantastic</em>! First of all,  I love that they decided to couple Pinkie with Twilight,  here. They've got a great dynamic with each other - Twilight was lower on sarcasm than normal,  <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> perhaps out of sympathy for Pinkie</span>,  which is a really neat writing choice. Still,  her down-to-earthness and patience makes her a <em>great</em> straight mare to Pinkie's antics. Speaking of,  Pinkie Pie was <em>phenomenal</em>! She managed to keep her zaniness <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> even when she was depressed and seriousness</span>,  and she made it <em>work</em>. I was swapping back and forth between laughing and feeling genuinely sad for her.
<p></p>The plot was great,  both in terms of concept and execution. I like that they went in a different angle from the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> standard <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadClown" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadClown">Sad Clown</a> cliche</span>,  and made it something really believable - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> eventually you <em>are</em> gonna have to give up on what you love</span>. It occured to me a while ago that I've never considered retirement to be a thing I wanted to do,  so that's a really personal message for me,  and I love that it managed to resolve itself in a happy way. Best of all Pinkie seems to have learned from A Friend In Deed,  and she's actually respecting somepony else's wishes this time around,  even though she <em>is</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> pushing him to take up clowning again</span>. IT makes her feel sweet when she could have easily been obnoxious.
<p></p>I love Ponyacci,  too. Oh god,  do I love Ponyacci. I love how you can see the energy in him,  and a sort of warmth and happiness even when he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> down in the dumps</span>,  and especially when he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> performing and teaching</span>. You genuinely see love for his craft in there,  which really helps to sell it. I <em>adore</em> his design,  both in-costume and out(But mostly in). If there was ever a Ponyacci toy I'd snap it up in an <em>instant</em>.
<p></p>The art as a whole was fantastic. I actually kinda like that they deviated more from the main series' style in this comic; I think the more simplistic style really work for it,  and the gummy element really helps the feeling. It's super creative,  exploding with energy and meshes really well with the story.
<p></p>I just... it's <em>fantastic</em> you guys,  I can't stress that enough. It reminds why I love Pinkie so much when she gets real and proper focus. It makes me wanna see a Pinkie/Twilight episode(Okay,  I've wanted that for a while <strike>because I ship them</strike>,  but still). I <em>kinda</em> wish it had been longer,  but at the same time I recognize it'd be really hard to get anything else out of it - in a motive medium they could get some time out of Pinkie and Ponyacci's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> clowning scenes</span>,  and get some rapid-fire jokes in there,  but in comics they did the best they could.
<p></p>It's a bit of a competition between this one and the Rarity microseries for my favorite of the bunch,  but... I think this one pulls out just a <em>teensy</em> bit ahead. Rarity's had a deeper story,  and was longer so had more jokes overall,  but this one was just plain old <em>fun</em>.
