<p></p>How in eff is <em>Party of One</em> a "later" portrayal?
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">What's the difference? </div>
<p></p>In general Season One showed that most of the world was aware Pinkie was a headcase and reacted accordingly.  Season Two treats her almost as if she's normal and its everypony else whose wrong for not understanding it.

            @ginger: I dunno,  I think Pinkie can have a moment of clarity while still being a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> to some extent. Otherwise it doesn't seem like the same character developing. I think Rainbow Dash's nicer roles worked because to an extent she was still kind of abrasive and getting to grips with the role. Same for the saner character's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll">Not so Above It All</a> moments (even in Lesson Zero we see a slow evolution from rashional but fussy Twilight to completely insane Twilight which shows it's the same character).
<p></p>The 'dared to not act over the top' idea may work though.
<p></p>Also weren't people kinda bewildered by 'baloon Pinkie' in It's About Time? And they <em>certainly</em> were in Mmmystery.

<p></p>... I swear,  this topic is run entirely by Pinkie Pie's relatives.
<p></p>Seriously:  She goes from getting an understandibly puzzled reaction to the "zipping her lips" gag in Green Isn't Your Color,  to "I just happen to stash stuff all over Ponyville" (which you'd think somepony would find weird,  but absolutely nopony questions it).  It's like the difference between Day One and Day Three in Majora's Mask.

How about Swarm of the Century? They display the <em>opposite</em> trend. Pinkie's also shown to be pretty clueless in <em>the rest</em> of It's About Time.
<p></p>@Ginger: I agree that I'd prefer her rules to be less arbitrary. That's why the one's in my fic are better defined.

<p></p>Don't you start defending Pinkie's flanderization too!
<p></p>And no,  that doesn't work.  "Getting used to you" means I'm no longer surprised when you get irrtiable about Pinkie or thinking you're being insulted or something.  But if I logged on one day and found my actual posts had been edited to actually <em>contain</em> insults just so you'd be justified,  that WOULD be weird,  no matter what.
<p></p>It's like above poster pointed out:  S1 Pinkie tried to be over-the-top but couldn't always maintain it due to reality.  S2 Pinkie can just do damn well whatever.

            I can sorta see why Pinkie is one dimentional to many,  she's usually the comic relief or the one that's actually causing trouble for another character,  she's the one giving another character pathos than actually gaining ones herself. That's usually why she is more sympathetic in her spotlight episodes,  where she is usually the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt Monkey</a>.
