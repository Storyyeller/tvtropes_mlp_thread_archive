            If Ginger couldn't get as far as Azula,  then it doesn't much matter,  does it? The first season is pretty slow,  but by the book of earth(season 2) it's pretty damn good.
<p></p>As far as the Celestia thing goes Ginger,  it's a fairly common element. Writers sort of need to hamstring her in order for a lot of stories like this. Does it make it better? Well,  no. But at least know you aren't alone in taking issues with it,  and maybe knowing the context of the issue (ie. it isn't so much as she's genuinely incompetent as she needs to be for the story) can help you get through it or ignore it?

</li><li>What is your opinion of Pinkie Pie and Applejack (if they're not covered by any of the above?)

            Yeah,  Ginger,  like I said,  the first season is all about the main characters and setting up a million <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">ChekhovsGuns</a>. The second and third season is where the real villainy starts,  and where I think you'd really start to like it.

<p></p>I just have this absurd feeling that he would adore Azula...

<p></p>Hm....If you ever have free time you should give it another shake,  but it's not something you should force yourself to watch.

            @islmeer: Any discussion of Pinkie causes controversy on this thread (less so in other places). The episodes Feeling Pinkie Keen and Mysterious Mare Do Well are pretty toxic topics anywhere you go,  especially the later. Earth Ponies compared to other ponies tends to cause problems as well.
<p></p>I'm probably missing a few things but I'm sure others can inform you.

They're pretty much equally good in my opinion.

            @ilsemmer: It's less "avoid these topics" and more "know that some posters (ginger) have very strong opinions on them".  Specifically,  insinuating that AJ (or Earth Ponies in general) are inferior to the other ponies,  or gushing too much about Pinkie.  If he gets worked up,  it's probably nothing personal.

<p></p>Who is your favourite pony/character? Rainbow Dash
<p></p>Who is your least favourite pony/character? Hmmm... Of the Mane Six,  I guess Pinkie Pie.
<p></p>What is your opinion of Pinkie Pie and Applejack (if they're not covered by any of the above?) I like Applejack and Pinkie Pie is okay. She can be funny at times but I think she's also kind of annoying.
<p></p>What's your favourite part about the fandom? (This is mine) The bronies! They're so intense! It's awesome! :D

            really,  there is nothing you CAN'T talk about,  everypony here has there berserk buttons,  and we pick on ginger,  but he plays it up himself at times. It's all in good fun. Long as it doesn't dissolve into personal stacks we're cool with any topic and know how to properly sedate the berserk people if needed.
