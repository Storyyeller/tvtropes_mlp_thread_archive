            @Perpetual I know,  but they seem like a goto team (along with Celestia) to pit against a threat and have fail to make the situation look extra serious and make the eventual success by the heroes look all the more impressive.
<p></p>It's only happened twice for them so far,  I'll have to see if it happens again in season 3

            @Ginger You mean the <em>one</em> threat that they were ever sent in against? One occurrence is nothing you can base anything off of,  and they actually did quite well considering what they were up against. With Rarity,  they simply happened to be right there,  and it's pretty easy  not to expect to be kicked in the face by the person you're rescuing if you're not trained for that exact situation.

            That whole getting knocked out saving someone is true even for trained people if there' unlucky,  had a guy go overbaord (by choice) on our ship,  one of the rescue divers got a broken nose and had to be pulled out of water himself as well trying to get the jumper.

Why would you want that? The only way I can see that happening is an RD episode with a lesson in humility,  which RD has already gotten before,  so it would be redundant.

            Maybe it's more outstanding because the Wonderbolts haven't had any successful roles yet. 2 looks more significant compared to 0 at least.

<p></p>As for Rarity,  it was a jerk moment for her,  but she hammed it up way too much to be insufferable about it (that makeup <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">). She also got the point herself at the end and apologized very passionately. It was interesting to have an RD centered episode where RD herself wasn't being the jerk of the group.

            And that would be great. I'm just saying that you have nothing to complain about with what's already there,  though.

            Also,  I don't see how you can criticize Achron for having a time system that makes sense. If you want a competitive game,  you can't just have writers making up nonsense as they go. Games need consistant rules.
