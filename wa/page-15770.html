            I don't know if I'm supposed to think that Big Mac is a stud who gets all the mares,  or that he can only get mares who are suffering from a severe concussion.

            You mean the Big Mac issues,  or the comic as a whole? Because I thought the first two arcs were pretty good. Liked the first better,  but still.
<p></p>I kinda like what they're doing with Big Mac,  showing inside his head as he straightmans about. I'll agree they could have done <em>more</em> with it than him just having to deal with <em>other</em> ponies shit,  but it's enjoyable enough. Even if I do look forward to the Shiny and Cadence comics more than the second Big Mac one.

            I do agree about Homestuck. The setting constantly has more random stuff thrown in with previous things forgotten about,  so it's hard to take seriously. But I think the humor and the characters save it.

<p></p>Also,  I've never been one for the "normal man goes to do mundane task while <em>whacky shit</em> impedes him". And just generally I have never cared for any of the comics' humor,  characterization (which I still think is pretty thin),  or general creative decisions.

            I don't know,  I'm not actually that interested in the Shining and Cadance comic.  Granted I've only seen the cover,  but it looks way too much like one of our high schools.  Maybe the cover is misleading,  but I was hoping for something a little more fantastical than an 80s movie romance.

            Finished reading the first arc of the comic.  I have to say,  I thought it was hilarious,  though I do think it moved a little fast for my taste (just as an example,  the very first two pages have everything going just fine for the CMC,  then there's just one small panel of "what's wrong with those animals" and one of "AAAAAAHHHH" before cutting to the next scene).
<p></p>I also enjoyed how Spike's adventures seemed like a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a> in the main story,  then when I read the comic that actually shows them,  it's <em>still</em> pretty much one.

            @Death Cloud: that's... interesting,  but also deeply unnerving. Perhaps moreso because it's <em>not</em> malignant,  unlike so many other SCP items. I find myself curious what the 'original' crime there was. And for that matter,  since they seem... well,  not open to communication,  but certainly capable of it,  if any form of diplomacy were possible.
<p></p>Though I can't shake the feeling it feels vaguely as though it was written by PETA... though it demonstrates far too much subtly and self-awareness for that to be the case.

<p></p>I think the problem with it is that it took the comparison with dogs too far. Stuff like human pulled dog sleds is just silly,  not horrifying.

            @Nom: God tier counts,  and that's two more ways to evade death.  I think there are one or two more (exceedingly roundabout) ways of evading it,  but the point is that Hussie has introduced so many twists that it's hard for me to feel any tension because he might just pull something else out of thin air that negates any previous developments.
<p></p>@Story: That's basically why I'm reading. The cast is hilarious and their conversations are usually great. I'm just not as invested in the overall plot as I used to be because it's obvious that it's going wherever the hell Hussie wants,  regardless of whether it logically follows from previous events.
<p></p>As for the comics,  I have to admit I'm not <em>particularly</em> stokes for the SA and Cadance one mainly for the reasons Crow mentioned; it looks like too much of a departure from the show's normal setting. Which is fine for gag-centric stuff like the micro series,  but if we're getting actual backstory I'd rather have them tie it into the show more.
<p></p>The Celestia micro,  though... that's going to be fun.
