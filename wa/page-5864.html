            Flapping one's wings doesn't necisarrily generate lift,  in the way that flailing one's legs at the ground does not necessarily equate running. I imagine there's a technique to flying,  and she's just sort of... flailing. If her wings are at the same angle on the upstroke as the downstroke she's pushing herself down as much as up,  so there's that.
<p></p>Ot maybe she's just FAT. A FATTY,  FATTY FAT-CAKES PEGASUS. FATASUS.

<p></p>I don't think Rumble was actually flying in that tornado,  though. Too dangerous for a kid. He was probably just there for support,  or something? Or hell,  maybe he showed up so he could tell dash Thunderlane wouldn't make it?

Nope,  Rainbow Dash was already flying before her cutie mark. I imagine there are plenty of other flying blank flanks in the background as well (mostly at Flight Camp).

            Because he's an adorably polite little sprog? He didn't want to be rude by cutting in front? I mean,  he was the only kid there - he probably stood out in that respect,  that might be why RD spotted him in the crowd.

<p></p>Or,  maybe he was trying to take his brother's place? He'd have to have been turned away,  but it does seem like the kind of thing a kid his age would do.

            And I figure he just stuck out. I wouldn't say she was so much expecting him as knew he was there; she might have seen him earlier or something. Maybe she heard somepony talking about him.
<p></p>I just honestly can't see a kid that little participating. I mean,  listen to his voice again. He sounds like he'd be barely 8 or 9.

            Eh,  I'm going with the 'there to cover for Thunderlane" idea. Also,  it was a recruitment test. Spitfire was there to check for any particularly strong fliers.
<p></p>Huh,  you know,  it occurs to me about the wonderbolts: Sorain is a military stallion. We've seen wonderbolts on military operations,  fighting Spike and the like. I wonder if the wonderbolts actually require/provide some degree of military training,  or if they just happen to pull from the airforce frequently,  but will accept 'civilian' flyers as well?

<p></p>My headcanon is that Cloudsdale offers flight and weather training to any Pegasus that can fly. Possibly as a holdover from the era where every Pegasus would be trained in combat.
