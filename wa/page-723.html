            Oh My Gosh! Nerdgasm.  That clip is awesome. Now I whant see that episode even more that before (and wories free).
<p></p>And fact that John de Lancie voiced him. He is MLPFIM version of Q.
<p></p>And just like original he is not true villain,  have hidden motives,  what may be good for Mane Cast after all (anyone who watched TNG know what I'm talking),  so he is not some <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monster</a> or Knight of Cerebus.

It's more satisfying to see the characters beat the villain than it is to have the villain just stop bugging them because he's had his fun already.

            I'm still a little torn on Discord after seeing the clip.
<p></p>The Good: It's frickin' Q!  The voice,  the mannerisms,  the powers,  it's FRICKIN Q!  And while I can mostly see where the episode's going,  just having him as the villain is all kinds of awesome.
<p></p>The Bad: Then again,  they could easily overdo it like early TNG,  making Discord into such a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a> that he goes from "awesome" to "a joke."  And the design...I can see what they were aiming for,  but it doesn't look too impressive.  Nightmare Moon might have been less effective,  but she was at least <em>looked</em> like a major threat.
<p></p>And sorry to bring this up again,  but is he sticking around the whole season?  Because frankly,  I don't think it would work.  He's powerful enough as an effective one-shot,  but anything beyond that will only suck out any sort of threat he might carry.  HIM was a good villain for Powerpuff Girls,  but that was because the show was <em>built</em> to support characters like that.  If the first season was any indication,  this show...isn't.

            I know,  right?  Yes,  he's goofy.  But this is a show aimed at little girls.  Even at worst,  he was never going to be really really evil.  And again,  we have no idea what's going on in that clip other than Discord is playing a "game".  We have no clue what's at stake,  or why the cast is "playing".  Just because he acts goofy doesn't mean that he isn't powerful.

In a one minute clip he did more to hinder the cast than Nightmare Moon did in her entire episode.  So anyone who thinks he isn't threatening isn't paying attention.

            COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF WMG.  READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
<p></p>Apparently this was supposed to be the Season Finale.  It was apparently written,  storyboarded,  animated,  voiced,  and printed during that season's production,  but was held back in exchange for "Party of One" and "Best Night Ever."
<p></p>Perhaps this was meant to be the <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a></em>?
<p></p>The show begins with Twilight going to Ponyville,  making some friends,  and defeating a villain.  The next twenty-two episodes focus on the building relationships between the new group of friends while handling smaller crises such as the Ursa Minor or the dragon,  ending with the ponies going to the Gala.  Then,  an extremely powerful villain appears and uses the same character development against the ponies,  turning them against each other by exploiting their weaknesses and breaking their friendship apart.  Only in the end,  they manage to get back together and defeat him,  seal him back up,  and go back to Ponyville closer than ever.
<p></p>The last few My Little Pony shows were only marginal successes,  with only the first G1 cartoon receiving any real acclaim from anyone.  So,  it was obvious going in that this show probably would receive the same lukewarm reception.  When it became a huge hit,  the executives ordered that a second season begin production.  Thus,  "Return to Harmony" was shelved as the Season Two premiere (giving the staff more of a buffer and allowing the season to start a few weeks earlier than expected) and added two "normal" episodes to fill out the twenty-six ordered for the first season.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">
<p></p>I know I'm way wrong,  but hey,  it's a fun theory anyway.

This series needs a good villain every now and then. I'm all for adding sympathy to antagonists (as you should know Death) but evven I just want to see a fun bad guy this time. Leave the moral ambiguity alone. You're basing you're entire theory on the fact that Discord acts like Q,  which is nothing short of absurd

            @Gallo,  that's not really spoiler or theory...I think all of that is fairly well known information among fans. (Well,  except for the part about the reason behind the decision to shelf Discord for 2nd season,  I'm not sure if that clearly was the main reason.)
