            @Japanese Teeth,  well it's true. You think I was suddenly good? 12 long years of never stopping. 7 years ago  I used to draw like AHR.
<p></p>@Kegi,  I think it's a fascinating topic worth exploring. Despite my vehement stereotyping of the south,  how would Applejack herself react?

            @Kegi It would certainly be an interesting topic for a fanfic,  considering 90% of the ships in this fandom are homosexual to begin with. There's a fine line between a well developed subplot and a randomly thrown in obstacle for the ship du jour though,  so it would have to tread lightly.

            @Kegisak: I agree that it <em>could</em> be done well,  but you'd have to really work hard at it to keep it from coming off as massively OOC.  I can't really imagine any of the cast being actively homophobic while still seeming like themselves.  Not to say that it couldn't be done,  but it would be really difficult to pull off,  and I personally probably wouldn't be interested in it anyway.  I tend to view most fanfic like Bonus content for the show proper.
<p></p>I was actually kicking around an idea for a while where two ponies get into same sex relationship only for one of their parents to disapprove...and then it turns out that the only reason the parent doesn't like it is because they wanted grandchildren,  and they learn to live with it.
<p></p>I never said it was a <em>good</em> idea.

I'm not too familiar with background ponies and I may have missed a few). Their voices were unique and pretty well done IMO.

            So far from what I've noticed the background ponies fall into the same problem you see with a lot of cartoons: in lieu of their characters having any established personality,  they try to make them interesting by giving them really weird/wacky voices,  which only serves to make them less sympathetic/understandable.

            @Mousa,  <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JTeeth" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JTeeth">J Teeth</a>: I'm honestly not sure that it would be AJ. She could very easily be conservative - she has very clear older family values,  and I also have a tendency to stereotype the south - but she still strikes me as remarkably open-minded. If anything the fact that it happens simply wouldn't occur to her.
<p></p>If it were anypony,  I think RD would be the most homophobic. She'd have reason to - she <em>has</em> to have heard more than a few jokes in her time - plus she simply has the personality to reject it.
<p></p>The thing about it,  though,  is that homophobia doesn't <em>have</em> to be hate. My family is incredibly accepting of me,  but my mother and brother are still mildly homophobic. They've told me that the thought of it makes them uncomfortable. That's the sort I'm talking about.
<p></p>Like,  let's say that it is AJ who happens to be the homophobe here. The story could easily be about her trying to come to sorts with,  say,  Big Mac's sexuality. She <em>wants</em> to be there for him,  and she <em>wants</em> to understand it,  but she can't. It makes her uncomfortable and confuses her,  and she may even hate the fact that she's homophobic. The story,  then,  becomes much about her struggles,  why she feels that way,  and how to overcome it.

They're pretty much a running gag though,  so the over the top voices on them are probably on purpose.

            I'm not one to say this out loud,  usually,  but since the topic has shifted in the general direction (and the fuss that would have been kicked up about it seems to have died down),  I might just admit it. Same-sex relationships don't really sit well with me. Not in the real world,  at least. For some reason,  the separation of fiction from reality makes it easier for me to dismiss the detail.
<p></p>The thing is,  though,  I've been in a position where two of my closer friends <em>were</em> in such a relationship. And that was okay. While I may not be comfortable with the concept,  it's not my place to say who one can or cannot fall in love with.
<p></p>I dunno,  maybe I'm not as uncomfortable with the concept as I think I am.
<p></p>I don't even know what my point was with all this.

            I am a christian so I won't lie on where my position lies about this issue.
<p></p>However no matter the issue hating people for being gay or homophobia is of course something that is wrong.I think that even if you don't agree with a person lifestyle (if you do) is never a justification for treating people bad in anyway.

            Don't worry,  Kyler.  It's no one's business to tell you what you're comfortable with,  and I don't think anyone here will jump at you for taking a risk and admitting it; love and tolerance,  after all.  But <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiTheWay" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiTheWay">we</a> don't bite. =)
