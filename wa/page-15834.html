            Specifically  Vinyl's comment that Ponyville has poor acoustics and that she'll lose him if he's too far away.
<p></p>And it shouldn't be all of her character,  but something more noticeable.

<p></p>That's kind of the point I'm trying to make. Even with the many incidents that happen in Ponyville,  it's still not as bad as Metropolis,  Gotham,  or even Townsville.

            Ah,  I see. What I meant by that was... I think - bearing in mind I wrote this like three years gone,  almost - that the houses were smaller and more set apart,  so the sound would dissipate faster than a city with big,  tight buildings that would trap sound.

            @Mio: I'm with you on the superhero comment. While there are regular disasters,  they don't happen on a daily basis like they would in a big city. Ponyville isn't a large enough town to believable have a lot of disasters in such a short period. And the fact that they relied on very mundane disasters rather than monsters or something is really weird.

            I think for me the funniest part of MMDW was where Rainbow Dash kept having problems because she would stop to say her catchphrase or announce herself,  meaning that she would miss her chance to actually do any heroic acts,  in a good subversion of the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction">Talking Is A Free Action</a> trope (something that kind of confused me when I first became a fan of magical girl anime).
<p></p>On the earlier subject of Bon Bon having clones,  that made me remember one of the pony "birthday fortune" things where based off of your birthday,  it would give you a scenario and a pony to go with it.  The one that it gave me was something like "make battle clones of Bon Bon, " which confused me at the time because I wasn't sure what "battle clones" were.  That was before the Canterlot Wedding story came out,  and then it was <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious In Hindsight</a> because that story DOES feature battling clones in the plot!
