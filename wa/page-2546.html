            I imagine I'd frequent the library quite a bit. I wonder if Twilight would be in need of an assistant for her research. It doesn't seem like the sort of thing that Spike would be interested in,  so...
<p></p>then again,  Spike probably wouldn't want anyone moving in on his territory for any reason. So maybe I could study myself and become a research partner?
<p></p>I don't know,  I'd just love to find out how the mechanics of their universe work.

            Being an Earth Pony might be cool. Superstrength is always an interesting power,  and it'd be way cool to have a fast-growing garden and cook all the things.
<p></p>Though it <em>would</em> be nice to fly...
<p></p>I think it'd almost be better to not be given a choice as to what sort of pony to become,  because I'd always wonder. There's a reason that,  if given three wishes,  my third wish would be to forget that I had had those wishes. Basically,  it'd be a wish for peace of mind.

            I think I'd enjoy something about being each of the races. Pegasi can fly,  which would be amazing. Unicorns have magic,  which would be convenient. Earth Ponies have simplicity,  which would be peaceful and relaxing.
<p></p>And I mean there's other benefits as well. As a pegasus I could explore,  and see more of the world. As a unicorn I could study things in greater depth,  and figure out how they work. As an earth pony I could be right there with the world. Plus fresh grown ingredients for cooking. I can't say which I'd choose,  if I could. But I think it might come down to pegasus or Earth Pony.
<p></p>You know,  my desire to fly is actually sort of funny,  when you consider that I'm afraid of heights. But I love flying in a plane as well... maybe it's just that when you're that high up,  or in something that's actually flying on its own,  it doesn't register as being high.

            I'd like to be a Pegasus,  flying seems awesome. Plus I'd probably get in shape in Equestria since there's a distinct lack of the Internet.
<p></p>I just realised that I wouldn't want to visit Fluttershy. Because I hate most animals and they hate me.
<p></p>On what do you do? I'm studying the sciences at College and hoping to get into Biochemistry at University.

            We need to talk to Hasbro calmly,  persuade them that there is good money in releasing a DVD set. Oh yeah,  and that it would be recommendable to have an official Hasbro channel on Youtube with all the episodes in good quality.
<p></p>The way to a company's heart is through its wallet.
<p></p>How many voices can we get on youtube for hasbro to listen to? A video petition with bronies of all ages and any children of theirs would help.

            Yeah,  this whole Hasbro vs youtube thing is really,  really bad. Especially for people like me who are outside of the US.
<p></p>I would buy the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDs">DVDs</a>,  obviously (assuming they'd ever release those),  but not being able to watch the episodes when everyone else does will be a huge blow to my participation in the fandom,  which would suck out most of the fun out of being a fan in the first place.
<p></p>Maybe I should go download the episodes that have been aired,  before they go away.

            They have to know that this won't stop people.  Ponyarchive was a legitimate takedown,  I agree,  but if they start stepping on YouTube streams,  people will just use even less legal means to share episodes.

            I mean,  really,  I get it. There is all kinds of legalese involved that would hurt their profits if they'd keep allowing this. But doesn't cutting off everyone outside of the US from the fandom hurt even more?
<p></p>I really don't want to be a pirate. Every time I find myself pirating,  I feel guilty. But when there is no other way to actually acquire the episodes when I want them,  I don't have much choice.
<p></p>As one of the commenters on ED said: Hasbro,  I really do want to give you money. Please sell to me as well.

            Sort of,  but not quite. That meme is more about how the salesman can stop pitching and start cashing,  like after a particularly good trailer for a new entry in a trusted series. This is more about how the salesman should actually start to open his shop so I can give him the money. "Open up and take my money!",  so to speak.

<p></p>Seriously... does Hasbro even comprehend how large this fandom is? How could they possibly think that alienating everybrony who is NOT american is a good idea?
<p></p>from my standing there's a very,  VERY simple solution to this. Just allow <em>everyone</em> to see the latest episode on the hub website. Not just those in the US

They have sold the broadcasting rights to multiple TV networks outside of the US,  even before the whole 'brony' thing caught on,  and those probably aren't too happy about having bought something for broadcast that can be freely found on Youtube. Or any site for that matter,  even the Hub's.
<p></p>The brony movement caught everyone by surprise,  and threw a big pebble into the business machine.
