            See,  again Blissey that is one of the great reat strengths of ths show,  they don't shoehorn in a single moral then hammer it all episode,  they just make the morals grow organically from the story,  and therr are many many difffernt things anyone can pick out from any episode.
<p></p>so far there's only been on episode that took an aesop and rammed it into you head the whole time...and it's the most ragged on and criticized episode,  and not just for those reasons...the whole thing was a mess.

<p></p>I know you like to dump on MMDW every chance you get,  but I think nearly everyone can agree that it's not nearly as bad you you're making it out to be. While the characterization is way off,  the music,  animation,  action,  and continuity nods were all phenomenal. Is is worse than most of the other episodes? Yes. Is is <em>bad</em>? Not in my opinion,  at least.

            That's pretty much exactly it,  Pip. Except it's got other things in it too... less pleasant things,  and things that can do you a lot of harm. Plus they stain your fur yellow and brown and smell bad.

            Well,  that's not what it means <em>here</em> - here it refers to a certain sort of person,  though not generally in kind context. So yes,  it is a bit rude.

            I think people hate on MMDW because they believed the other cast acted a little out of order as well (at least no less so than in Lesson Zero,  where they were equally well intentioned and didn't see the problem),  yet it ignored the various Aesop in favor of ramming it towards one. As mentioned before one of the fun parts about the show is it's grey outlook on the Aesops and the whole 'it takes two to start an argument' outlook. Admitedly even that may have been tolerable if not for a few writing errors.
<p></p>I think Lesson Zero may get a little flak because it almost goes the opposite way and dilutes the main aesop in favor of the others learning one,  granted I doubt within all the horrific consequences Twilight didn't learn a thing,  she even has a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a> moment. I also sorta got the idea the others' feeling bad was more just to show how devoted to Twilight they were and give leaway into Celestia handing message reports to others.
<p></p>Otherwise it's arguably my favorite episode. Definitely played part in my fondness for Twilight.

            So,  I got a few PM's from someone asking me when I was continuing my liveblog of Fallout Equestria,  and apparently there were more people than the 2-3 in this thread reading it. With that in mind,  and the fact that I can't properly critique something without reading it all the way through,  <a class="urllink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/lb_i.php?lb_id=13364505350B40040100&amp;p=15&amp;i_id=13387536100I07271200">I decided to pick it up again,  for the time being.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> My feelings on it haven't exactly improved,  but my rage has cooled off,  at least.
