            What about Ability AND hard work? I didn't become a good designer just because I'm naturally an attentive person,  I spent a long damn time getting myself in the mindset. Just because a person has some natural aptitude,  doesn't mean they don't work at it. Hell,  half the time someone seems to have a gift it's because they enjoy it and work at it.

            @Ginger Except that just about <em>everyone</em> is either good at <em>something</em>. In fact,  that's part the driving concept behind cutie marks in this show. You can't condemn natural talent when everyone has it.

I doubt that RD was just born amazing at flying. It's her passion,  so she worked on it constantly until she was as good as she currently is. And she's <em>still</em> trying to improve.

            Okay,  but as I said,  in those cases there is no real need to show off.  It's just a job.  Plus she seems to be in charge of that,  so she gets to dictate what to do.

<p></p><em>Sorry,  I will ALWAYS prefer someone working hard with no particularly impressive natural ability to someone who was born good and worked hard to hone their gift. It's just how I am.</em>
<p></p>I'll always prefer a person training themselves to be good at something which they aren't naturally adept at to someone who has natural ability and works hard to hone it...
<p></p>Like take the Halfhand from ASOIAF. He's awesome beyond words beause he was born right handed and after losing loads of his fingers,  FORCED himself through sheer training to wield a sword in his left hand... better than he did before.
