            With regards to there being no mention of other bearers,  that's why I said it's unlikely. From my point of view,  though,  if Celestia had four friends just as close to her as the mane six are to each other,  I get the feeling that she wouldn't want reminders of the fact that she outlived them all prominently displayed in her own throne room. It's not egomania,  it's attempting to avoid the pain of their loss.

            I wonder. What if you had the scenario where one pony has a crush on another but is too afraid to admit it. Would Cadence's magic give them a shot of Dutch courage?

            I see Nightmare Moon as Luna <em>under very specific circumstances</em>. Unde which she is significantly more powerful. I don't even think that Luna is fully grown (she'll be Celestia's size when she is and she'll be much more powerful then).
<p></p>On Cadance's spell,  it strengthens and repairs existing love,  but that's not all she can do. Now, I may strongly disagree with the power level of alicorns in The <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/PonyPOVSeries" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/PonyPOVSeries">Pony POV Series</a> but I did find a scene in it both amusing and heartwarming where a confused!filly!Cadance is being scolded by Celestia for being irresponsible with her powers and nearly accidently causing a palacewide orgy. Of course,  in that series,  Cadance only <em>believed</em> that she was the alicorn of love when it's actually a different alicorn who is the alicorn of love and Cadance is the alicorn of music,  harmony and bonds.

            Well,  at the very least we can now definitely peg her domain as Love and possibly Hope with her connection to The Crystal Heart,  since those are explicitly the emotions that power it.

<p></p>I've heard that theory before and it's never quite gelled with me.
<p></p>I know we're talking about magical talking horses here,  but for me it's too farfetched for a little pony to somehow transform into a colossal (like,  hundreds of times bigger than a planet) ball of fire and gas.
<p></p>Yeah,  we're talking about magic here,  but there's a limit.

            You seem to be implying that their stars are colossal balls of gas and fire. For all we know,  they could just be glow-in-the-dark dots painted on the inside of a ginormous sphere.

            @Perpetual Lurker: I agree that Cadance is the alicorn of love. Just giving some context for the scene.
<p></p>@Purple Dalek: I don't believe that they became true stars. For a start,  stars can't really converge on the moon. Just <em>looked like stars</em> from Earth. They were just glowing brightly.
<p></p>EDIT: Note,  that  turning someone into a star using magic is something that isn't out of the power of some wizards.

            Perhaps "the stars will aid in her escape" had a double meaning. In addition to the literal stars that Twilight saw helping NMM escape,  it was a reference to the Elements of Harmony helping Princess Luna return to her right mind.

<p></p>Also,  the ponies call it Earth. We've known that since Hearth's Warming Eve. Still would be useful to be able to easily differentiate it from out planet.

            They don't call it Earth. Earth was one of the proposed names for the new Earth Pony land. "Earth" in the context of their world simply refers to the ground they walk on,  not the planet as a whole.

Not just a chessmaster,  but one who prepared a thousand years and put herself in danger,  just to save her sister.
