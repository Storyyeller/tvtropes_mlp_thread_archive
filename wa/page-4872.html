            Ultimately the thing most wrong with Pinkie is just an inconsistent usage.  In her better outings,  she fits into the setting and integrates well with the world around her.  In the worse ones,  she's a clown who distracts from and contrasts sharply with that same world.  "Putting Your Hoof Down" was one of the better outings (despite her strange definition of "assertive"),  "It's About Time" was worse.

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Divide attacking into physical and magical,  and having the enemies weak against certain types. </div>
<p></p>I hope that either all six ponies are usable at once,  or else that they're switchable mid-battle,  or else that the resistances and weaknesses are well balanced so that even if you unknowingly pick a bad team you can still win.  I've seen <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGs">RP Gs</a> take this kind of premise and utterly mess it up (<em>Robotrek</em> on the SNES for example,  had some enemies that were outright invincible if you didn't balance your stats the absolute right way).

<p></p>I was just about to say something like that.  FS is next to useless in a mook fight...absolutely essential in a giant monster fight.
<p></p>AJ and RD are mook smashers...Rarity is your charmer (get her to buy your stuff).

            No,  even though I like Pinkie as a character,  I can see where you're coming from,  Ginger.  Pinkie is definitely hyped a lot by both the fans and the show,  and merchandise does tend to feature her prominently (the most notable I can think of was a brand of toothpaste for toddlers that I saw in a store that was a "My Little Pony" brand and Pinkie was the only character on the box).  I had a similar issue when it came to Seiya from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorMoon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a> when I was younger,  too,  that is,  my hatred of the character was probably made worse by the fact that she/he is probably the most popular Starlight and the one who got the most episodes and screentime.

            @Moe: Hm... that's a fair point. Most of the ponies would have <em>some</em> degree of skills in both sections,  but would favour one over the other. The one thing to keep in mind is that you would <em>always</em> need a healer.
<p></p>Early final fantasy games allowed for up to five or six party members at once,  but I'm not sure how much I like that. Too many party members and it sort of becomes micromanagement,  in a way. Not the most fun thing in the world.
<p></p>Once I get my hands on Persona 4 I'll see how they did their system. It <em>seems</em> fairly solid,  but I'd need to play it to get a good feeling for it.

<p></p>Maybe instead of <em>fighting, </em> they could play a Collectible Card Game.
<p></p>Twilight Sparkle summons Beaver Warrior in attack mode!
<p></p>Or maybe they could use Beyblades,  and the armor shops all sell new tops and parts for them.

            @Mio: the 'game' would be an RPG for kids... more than likely it would be fairly heavily story-based. My major source of inspiration on this front is what I've seen of Persona 4,  but less... dark.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">So like,  how the persona is the representation of a character's force of will and the monsters they fight are more representative of inner demons? (I'm using this analogue so much,  oh my god)

            hmm.. Persona with ponies?  Cool.  I also like the fact that you're emphasizing negotiation/social combat above the physical aspects of combat,  Keg. Too many games focus on physically conquering the opposition.

            Which is why some of the enemies simply won't be vulnerable to direct mental attacks.
<p></p>The vast majority of people you deal with will be reasonable. It's the big bad people who you can't reason with... but even then,  you can still will then into submission with numbers. Talk them to death.

            @kegisak Yeah,  but I was thinking of making it a lot more involved and less subtle than that.
<p></p>Like you know how there's blunt damage and piercing damage in some RPG's? Well stuff like that but related to different mental states.
<p></p>Like,  RD is egotistical,  so enemies that use attacks that counteract Egotism would deal more damage to her.
<p></p>things like that... I'm probably not explaining this well <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            The last time Pinkie broke the fourth wall was in A Friend in Deed where she pulled out the felt check mark from her <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a>. Though,  yes,  most people do tend to think cartoon physics = broken fourth wall.
<p></p>Something that I've noticed is that a lot of people end up becoming dissatisfied with certain episodes when they end up taking the show more seriously than the show takes itself. Now,  exactly how seriously the show takes itself varies,  but at its core the show <em>is</em> a comedic cartoon and therefore it will try to be funny and not take itself seriously. What makes this show good to me is that I find that it manages to be funny without sacrificing the characters and what they have learned for it. It seems to me that a lot of people take that emphasis on character and extrapolate that anything that <em>doesn't</em> take great strides in character development or drama is immediately inferior.
<p></p>Edit: And once again I'm late to the party due to taking too much time to put my thoughts into words. I really am bad at this,  aren't I?

I think Pinkie Pie is sort of the middle ground,  she's often little more than comic relief,  but they do tend to give her the odd spotlight episode where she is more humanized. The show tends to remember to give focus on a trait or depth for most of the cast every now and then enough times that it keeps them developed.
<p></p>Similar to Applejack and Twilight Sparkle,  whose straight laced attitude can make them seem kind of bland with a consistant rotation of episodes in this role,  however after a handful of such episodes they follow it with a big deconstruction where they act extremely flawed and blundering,  making them rather well rounded. Same for Rarity's shallowness,  Rainbow Dash's obnoxiousness,  Fluttershy's shyness,  etc. Usually <em>just</em> as you start to think they're getting restricted in role,  they make an episode that completely deconstructs it.
