<p></p>Fancy Pants is awesome. <br>Also,  Rarity is best pony. Even more so than before. <br>Also,  I loved the voice acting on all the Canterlot ponies of this episode. <br>Also,  the song was awesome. <br>Also,  Fancy Pants rules.

            I've always had the relatively simple head canon that Discord has been around forever,  and that Celestia and Luna are part of an entire country of Alicorns,  who decided to leave their homeland  (think of Asgard) in order to explore the world around them. Their travels lead them to Equestria,  and they were so disgusted by Discord that they vowed to liberate the ponies under him and end his reign of terror.
<p></p>In my head,  the sun and the moon didn't exist until Celestia and Luna made them. Discord wouldn't have needed such organization.
<p></p>but what do I know... I'M not kegi! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">

<p></p>I don't think Discord scared Celestia as much as Rarity just did,  and it's only just reached the opening credits.

            Well,  I'm sorry Ginger! It's just what I do,  it's sort of literally my job to come up with shit like this.
<p></p>I also have another headcanon established for <em>The Colour You Bleed</em> - Discord is a primordial god,  one of the first and true divinities in the world of MLP. There are other primordial gods as well,  but most of them have phased out. They had control over concepts rather than things,  so there were also gods of order,  creation,  destruction,  etc.
<p></p>Luna and Celestia aren't true gods,  but rather old souls. Old souls are the spirits of dead ponies who accumulated astounding amounts of magical power in their lifetime,  enough to create echoes of themselves in death. The echos latched on the the ambient magic in the world,  and started to bond with it,  essentially becoming creatures of pure magic. In the old days of primordial ponies there were hundreds of old souls,  as their magical power was much more raw and massive. These days,  only someone like twilight could become a old soul,  and only through pretty intense training to buff up what she's already got.
<p></p>The old souls could become gods when they were born,  either through ponies or through bonding themselves to certain objects or elements. When they do,  they become gods over them,  because they are literally part of it. That's how you get gods like the god of theshifting sands,  or the god of a forest. More powerful old souls could bond themselves to big things,  like the sun,  moon,  and ocean. Luna an Celestia didn't bond themselves to the sun and moon originally,  but were actually the product of three old souls combining themselves: <a class="urllink" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FwcmGCchcJBFxjCe4O3HkEc6xLn2o8BaWrmN_8Xt8kU/edit?hl=en_US#">the three kings<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. They took control of the sun and the moon when they got older and more powerful.
<p></p>There's more to it; old souls could make allegiances and exchange power among themselves (that's how Celestia took control of the moon from Luna),  so you could have one astoundingly powerful old sould because a whole bunch of others swore fealty to him. But it gets pretty deep,  and essentially unimportant to the 'how Luna and Celestia came to be' aspect of the headcannon,  and if I wanted to talk about all of it I should probably take it to the fanfic thread.

            Unlike everyone else,  I really didn't like this episode,  in fact,  it's probably my least favorite so far of the entire 2nd season,  if not the entire show.  My pros and cons list for it:
<p></p><ul><li>The Bad (get that overwith first):
<ul><li>I thought it had a major <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a>.  Or at the very least,  I was expecting and hoping for Rarity's lies to get found out and for her to be at least scolded for them,  but that unfortunately didn't happen.  So as well as "it's good to keep your background and friends in your heart" as the stated Aesop,  I thought there was another bad one of "it's okay to lie if it gets you social connections."  Yes,  I know that many people do that in real life and think it's a good thing,  but I personally DON'T think that's a good thing at all,  especially the way she lied to her friends.  Then again,  I have NO desire myself to get any connections with "high society" of that sort,  so some of this is just me being Rarity's complete opposite.
</li><li>I didn't like the way the high society ponies were portrayed as basically all being "English" when even the princesses don't have accents like that,  heck,  even Blueblood didn't speak RP!  They may have been trying to do a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFairLady" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFairLady">My Fair Lady</a> reference somehow (mainly the race scene reminded me of that with the way the high class ponies were so subdued next to Rarity's cheering) but I still thought it was annoyingly stereotypical and inconsistent.
</li><li>The bellhop abuse bugged me too,  even though it was probably supposed to be slapstick,  but abuse of innocent service workers just isn't that funny to me.
</li><li>The approval from the Canterlot ponies was condescending at best.  I don't really think "charmingly rustic" is that much of a compliment.
</li></ul></li><li>Pros:
<ul><li>Applejack's "garden party" joke was funny and so was Rainbow Dash throwing cake.  The latter was probably the highlight of the story for me,  sadly enough.
</li><li>At least not everyone in Canterlot was outright mean,  although,  once again,  they were annoyingly all British for some reason except for the painter pony who said he was from Ponyville.
</li></ul></li></ul><p style="font-size:x-small;font-style:italic;">edited 3rd Dec '11 11:10:21 AM by Rainbow</p><p></p>

            Well like I said Ginger: This sort of thing is just what I do. My school has forced me to come up with idea after idea,  plot after plot,  several times a week,  every week. I've gotten really,  really good at it. It's sort of like getting mad at a professional boxer for beating you up. You can be as good as you like,  he's just going to be better because <em>it's his job</em> to be better.
