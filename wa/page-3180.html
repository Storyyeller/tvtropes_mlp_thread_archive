            I never said RD did any of it on purpose,  where did I imply this because I get the impression you all thought I thought this,  because I know she isn't an insulting braggarty jerk on purpose,  it's just who she is because somewhere in her development he didn't get sensitivity or humility training,  it happens,  but still she has the sort of personality and mannerisms that would put others down,  intentional or not,  and the others' flaws are not as such except maybe Rarity who apperently has no qualms insulting you if fashion is concerned.
<p></p>"is it because you were insulted when I insulted your hair?"

            No pony,  or person can possibly go through life without annoying,  pissing off,  or doing SOMETHING that negatively effects another pony/person. So listing off who has and has not is really quite nonsensical. What matters is whether or not it was,  1. Intentional and/or 2. The result of actions that they should have known better then to do.

            Wait.  Wait wait wait.  Mousa is sort of defending Dash?!  What the hell did I <em>miss</em> while I was out?!
<p></p>Also,  if Ditzy <em>ever</em> appears again in the show,  she'll be called Ditzy and not Derpy.  The writers were entirely unaware of the name's connotations and now they know.
<p></p>...Frankly,  we'll be lucky if she shows up again at all now that they know the fandom made them call a character mentally retarded on the Hub...

            @Bad let's not get into that. My issue was never that the contestants didn't know what they were getting into. It was that Dash came up with the idea in the first place and honestly expected these pets to DIE for her.

            @Badwolf,  none of those,  Except the parasprite one,  are really what I meant,  first none of those were intentional,  and as for "should have known better" I'm talking about gross,  willful ignorance. most of those the bad decision were brought on by stress,  and/or other emotional states clouding there judgment. Yes there was a better option,  but you can understand why the ponies choose the one they did. By "should have known better" I mean at the time they made the decision,  not looking back with hindsight and non-emotionally charged mind.

Sure it would be bad if they didn't but she only brought through the ones she thought could take it. And at the end of the day she was right and they got a huge confidence booster for being awesome.
