<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Also,  RE Enlong's theory about the Everfree being the site of a large battle,  that makes sense - fit's with my own fanon too,  about their being several magical 'hotspots' caused by magical battles or cataclysms. </div>
<p></p>Agreed. Though I consider <em>Equestria itself</em> one of these hotspots. That's why only earth ponies can grow stuff there. And why they don't have a working water cycle.

            Maybe a strait that is threatened by the periodic appearance of a terrible whirlpool. [/stealing from the Odyssey]
<p></p>And Lauren said that that's not why the Everfree is the way it is? Ah,  well,  there's still the site of the battle of Discord,  and I still maintain that the forest itself is where the battle with Nightmare Moon occured. Perhaps the scope of the forest expanded over he millenium,  swallowing the castle that was once an outpost on its edge.

<p></p>She actually said that. Technically,  I just think the Everfree was <em>helped along</em> by the fight. It <em>started</em> from an <em>earlier</em> fight.

            My opinion on Equestria is that it <em>would</em> regulate itself,  just that ponies took over because they could. For example,  in my blog Hoops works on the High Altitude division of the Weather team,  whose role is to analyze hints in the upper atmosphere that will give clues of what weather is going to crop up,  so the rest can plan accordingly. Basically,  meteorologists.
<p></p>And Apple,  if you're interested,  while it's not exactly close geographically,  I had come up with the idea of 'The White Cape',  a hotspot that stretches down between Equestria and Trottingham - so named because the first record of a pony entering it was a mare whose coat was completely black going in,  and completely white coming out. Also noteable,  the mare never spoke another word again,  so nopony knows exactly what happened in there. All anypony knows is that you <em>never</em> sail through White Cape.

            Maybe a reef,  or a cape. Real life has a ton of legends with dangerous as hell capes. I remember one said the reason the thing was so damn stormy was that the devil was chained at the bottom,   and his struggling was what made the waves so big.
<p></p>Or perhaps it could be what,  in the map,  looks like an empty patch of water,  because the cartographers couldn't,  or didn't,  write it down,  and from the outside,  you just see water.

            My theory is that the whole world is like Equestria. The Everfree is the exception not the rule. Otherwise it wouldn't be treat as the exception. All other countries have their own pegasus etc analogues.
<p></p>And I go with the Nightmare Moon battle is what broke the Everfree theory.

            On the other hand,  Equestrians have repeatedly demonstrated ignorance of the world outside of their borders,  so it's hard to say how much their opinions actually reflect the world they're in.

            But they have relations with other countries,  such as Saddle Arabia.
<p></p>I do very much like the idea of an elite guard stationed on the perimeter of the Chaos Grounds,  or whatever its official name is. It might be an interesting story to follow a pony who ventured into the perimeter. It might not end well,  though...

            Well,  sure,  politically. Canada has political relations with the Phillipines,  but I couldn't tell you about their climate or governmental structure.
<p></p>Considering the proximity of Ye Olde Oubliette,  perhaps the story could be about a small group chasing an escaped criminal in there? Could be kind of interesting - especially if the cirminal was particularly 'chatoic',  and adapted well to the latent magic inside. Could turn it into a surreal sort of survival-horror story.

            Well,  maybe. I mean,  in a situation like Equestria I have to imagine they just don't find that sort of thing as remarkable as we do. After all,  when the librarian can turn the frog into an Orange,  physical laws are more of a suggestion,  aren't they?
