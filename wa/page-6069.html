            You just seem to catch me at my down times Chadman,  I'm normally a lot more neutral,  though that comes with a meaner tongue and a delight in the suffering of others,  especially if irony is involved. I blame the 5 yeears of bullying taking a chunk out of my ability to see anything positive in anything I do and I am eternally convinced there is something wrong with me. I haven't been disproven yet.
<p></p>@Nomuru,  Nerve was a symptom was temporary stupidity,  I was having a good morning,  the crowds of idiocy on a Monday evening killed the rose colored glasses and allowed me to see myself as the failure in the eyes of my lord that I am. A worthless being designed to be an enteral chew toy pushed around by anything and everything.

            I think what you need to do is start carrying pepper spray around,  even if you're not being bullied anymore.  Having any form of self-defense tends to give one a huge confidence boost.
<p></p>Of course I wouldn't risk it in zones where its illegal,  but I don't recall ever seeing a law against pepper spray.
<p></p>Also,  Pony girlfriends.  Discuss.  Or not.

            Dude,  you work in the <em>service</em> industry. Everything and every one in the service industry is terrible - but <em>just</em> in the industry. You step outside and you're perfect again.
<p></p>I kinda feel you on the bullying thing,  though. I spent a long time being picked on as a kid,  it can be pretty rough. The bullying stopped in high school when I got huge,  but I was honestly pretty apathetic and honestly kind of a bastard for most of it. Since starting college,  though,  I turned into the man you know today... what I'm getting at is,  the longer you spend in an atmosphere you actually enjoy - and one you've chosen - the better outlook you'll have.

            @ David,  I'm more confused than anything else.
<p></p>@Kegi,  it seems every time I hear someone's bullying story it all seemed to stop when they suddenly acquired height. I can't relate since I've been the tallest lad in all the lands once 3rd grade and that didn't stop a soul so it mostly confounds me. If they're not afraid of authority they sure as hell aren't going to be intimated by the fact you're twice their size.
<p></p>And I guess I haven't found such an environment,  except maybe High School. College was a failure since I was confused how after a whole semester I was the only one that hadn't found some form of assimilation. What a nightmare UKY was...

            It's,  ah,  not so much height as my suddenly gaining the ability to lift over a hundred pounds with virtually no effort. Also the fact that I have a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug">Face of a Thug</a>,  so while I'm an ardent pacifist I <em>look</em> like I could flip out at any moment.
<p></p>More to the point,  though,  it wasn't actually the physical side that did it - though that was certainly an element. MY main tormentor was expelled in the eighth grade,  making him no longer an issue. By high school's time come around I was at least good at <em>passing</em> as genial - for all my snark and insult I was still <em>funny</em>,  so no one cared to much. I made friends a bit easier and my secondary tormentors mellowed out a bit. Things sort of just relaxed in general,  but my looks and size <em>kept</em> things that way. there were still unpleasant people about,  they just never decided to bother with me. I imagine it's different if your tormentors have been there throughout.
<p></p>Were you studying teaching in your first semester,  or was it just a general studies thing?
<p></p>I... was honestly kind of lucky about my school. I was expecting something much different from what I got,  but what I got appealed to a part of me I really hadn't given much thought to before. Even then it still took me the better part of a year to <em>really</em> get into it,  and everything just sort of... fell into place suddenly. I had a good long think,  and a bit of a break down,  but on the other side I knew what I wanted,  I knew what I was,  and I knew what I wanted to do. I won't deny that I got lucky in a lot of ways,  there.

            No,  they were always different,  that was part of the problem,  it was like I was a living target for five years until high school and this is from going from being bullied in Botswana to being bullied in American middle school by a wide range of people. It was like I had one for every other class.

            What did Drenius's avatar use to be?
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> So what do you guys think about Alicorns? Are they true immortal god-like beings,  ponies that are simply longer-lived and more powerful? Are they born by normal means,  ascended from normal ponies,  or are they part of creation? </div>
I saw some interesting answers <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20091027165742/http://geocities.com/fazior/sfthm/hiccups.html">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>â€”even back in the nineties,  there was someone answering questions in-character as a My Little Pony on the Web!  It seems to be going with an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors">Animated Actors</a> hypothesis where the ponies are playing characters based on themselves,  thus explaining why they get different personalities in different media,  and Dream Valley isn't really under attack all the time; the "villains" were also just actors of various species brought in to add variety and drama.
<p></p>I like the idea put forth toward the end there that alicorns were often used as stunt doubles,  especially if it's true that they generally age more slowly than other kinds of ponies,  so they're easily mistaken for baby ponies.  Therefore in "Escape From Catrina",  Baby Surprise must have refused to do any more stunts after she crashed into the building block arch,  and so they filmed the leapfrog scene with an alicorn made up to look like her.

            Modular arithmatic is what you get when you take a certian number and define it be equal to 0.
<p></p>So for example,  say we want to do modulo 12. Then we declare that 12 = 0
<p></p>So 1 = 13,  2 = 14,  3 = 15,  etc.
It's that simple
<p></p>Also,  is Moe Dantes still here?

            I use modular arithmatic in programming to determine divisibility in certain algorithms. Other than that,  though,  I don't really use it.

            Actually,  it comes up all the time. For example,  random number generators almost always use modular arithmetic. In fact,  pretty much everything computer related uses it.
<p></p>Also,  Cryptography is basically built on modular arithmetic.
