            Looking at EQD's episode roundup right now.  Holy crap,  I noticed the whole Lyra/Bon Bon thing,  but I didn't notice that Bon Bon's saddlebag had Lyra's cutie mark as a clasp.  That's awesome.
<p></p>Really Ginger,  you'd rather have a stroke of luck defeat the villain?  You know it's possible to outsmart someone without them looking like an idiot.  Intelligence is not a binary state you know,  you can have a smart villain who is just barely outmaneuvered.

            Because it's emotionally unfulfilling to have him defeated by dumb luck.  It makes the protatgonist's struggle seem like it was all for nothing.

            Likewise,  you can have a protagonist defeat a villain without actually outsmarting/fighting him,  or the ilk. In <em>The Colour You Bleed</em>,  Red Letter (the villain on the more political side of the plot) is defeated by Blueblood's character growth - Blueblood became unpredictable,  and there was no longer anything Letter could do to win,  because he was still working off the impression that Blueblood would act selfishly and stupidly,  when that was no longer the case. Similarly Iron Towers,  the villain of Blueblood's character arc,  was beaten because he expected Blueblood to be a coward,  and because he had gone insane over the course of the story. Both villains defeated by Blueblood's efforts,  without directly being outsmarted or outfought. They remain competent as when they began,  but failed due to a new element being introduce that aided the hero.

They just have to make it believable and show there was some amount of struggle and endurance in actually doing. There's a difference between defeating a villain and pwning them effortlessly.

            @kegi That's pretty much my favourite way for a villain to be defeated. Not because they were outsmarted,  but because they didn't understand something about the protagonist.
<p></p>Take my second Favourite villain of all time: Rotti Largo from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepoTheGeneticOpera" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepoTheGeneticOpera">Repo! The Genetic Opera</a>.
<p></p>80% of that film's events happen beacause of his manipulations. He's completely... COMPLETELY successful up until the VERY last second,  when a girl refused to kill her own father. That's all. He wasn't outsmarted. A girl just proved to be a better person than he'd expected

            I honestly can't agree with your position Ginger.
<p></p>In my opinion the villain simply "misunderstanding" something about the protagonist is much less satisfy and makes the villain look less competent then if he was actually outsmarted.

            Yeah,  exactly. Iron and Letter were in control (well,  dubious control - there was shit going on that <em>no one</em> had a handle on) - but in the end they failed because they expected Blueblood to be a scared spoiled brat,  and he wasn't.

            The problem with that,  Ginger,  is that you see any mistake that the villain makes ever as a sign of incompetence. You can be competent without being perfect.
