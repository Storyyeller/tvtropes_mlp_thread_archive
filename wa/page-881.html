            Definitely. That made me burst out laughing. Though really,  any of discords randomness was amazing. Dancing brofalo's,  a pony running along the screen,  and the flying pony doing that b-bl-b-bl-b thing.

            Damn you people,  I have to leave technology for a day and <em>18</em> pages? It's like you hate me or something.
<p></p>So I saw the new episode not to long ago and I enjoyed it,  sure it had it's problems but what doesn't. I think the best things about this ep were Discord of course and Fluttershy. One of the best sequences was the entire "Get Rainbow Dash back" thing.
<p></p>I look forward to things going back as normal.
<p></p>Discord's downfall,  while understandable and necessary,  disappointing. I was really hoping for a power-downgrade thing and he'd just be a trickster mentor t create new situations to complicate their usual slice of life adventures.
<p></p>Ah well,  beggars can't be choosers,  I liked it all the same.

            Know what would make the episode better?  The focus on the second half shouldn't have been on wrangling Rainbow Dash back,  and should've been on actively defeating Discord.  Sure,  Dash was the only pony missing for most of the episode,  and sure she can fly and has the determination to make it an adventure in itself for the others to pursue her,  but all the time was spent on that!  The time could've been put into a longer showdown with Discord.

            Finally noticed that Season 2 began. Fun season premier,  though the way Discord was defeated makes me think they ran out of time for everything they wanted to do.

Since Discord is a trickster <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a>,  a showdown where the cast had to cooperate with each other to outsmart Discord first so he would be left wide open for the Elements of Harmony would have been nice.  Much as I loved the Rainbow Dash sequence,  they probably should have applied it to the battle against Discord instead if they were pressed for time.

            Loved Fluttershy this episode; her being mean was awesome and her part in Rainbow Dash's capture was really good too. It's nice to see her wings being really important for once.
<p></p>And this episode just made me realize why I like the Slice of Life episodes: they're not good when it comes to battles. It was kinda anticlimatic to watch Discord just sit around and do nothing,  thinking they'd fail,  until it was too late -_- I'd have prefered if the Power of Friendship had overpowered his.
<p></p>Even so,  I loved the episode.

The Elements of Harmony aren't a Death Star superlaser; apparently the mane six simply had to get close enough to cast the spell.  What kind of fight could we have seen?  I suppose if this was literature or comic books we could get some sort of battle on the psychic/mystic plane,  but that's a bit too non-visual for <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation">Western Animation</a>.

What I didn't like was the pacing of the lead-up and aftermath of the whole thing.

            They did overpower him: Twilight cast a buble spell to protect them from mr. chaos,  and <em>then</em> they started rainbow stylin'. (Doesn't a MLP clip with that song exist yet? Is there a site where I can post a request that someone do it? I'm terrible with video editing,  but it would fir the show so <em>well</em>,  especially Dash).

            Here is how I imagined the final battle before it actually happened: Discord is finally well and truly pissed off. His lion arm is all rainbow-y; is eagle claw is all darkness-y. He puts his hands together and fires a surging river of dark rainbow light magic at them.
<p></p>And then I stopped imagining that and thought,  wow,  I really hope it happens.

            It would be cool if they did a Director's Cut of the two parter. I do at time feel that they really want to add more to it but couldn't due to time constraints.
