            That was a pretty funny episode,  and I saw the connections to the brony fandom immediately.  I liked this one,  especially with the way the book mirrored her life in the story (even with her ninja sneak into the hospital).  It made me laugh,  especially when she tried to get back into the hospital,  mainly because it was a move that I thought was very unexpected for her (I always pegged her as the type to try to hide pain and/or injury out of fear that she would look weak otherwise).  It also was hilariously audacious as well.
<p></p>@Ginger: No,  American hospitals don't throw the patients out that quickly.  It probably was a very cartoony way to show how rushed Rainbow Dash felt because she wanted to stay longer to finish her book.
<p></p>And in case anyone brings it up,  the reason I found Rainbow Dash's attempts to play sick funnier than Apple Bloom's is probably not only the audacity of Dash's case (trying to trick the doctor vs. trying to trick her family) but also because the only "bullying" in this story was in Dash's imagination,  while it was all too real in Apple Bloom's case and thus hit too close to home for me (Diamond Tiara is a difficult character for me to watch sometimes because of my own experiences,  although at least she does usually get some form of comeuppance).

            I am still curious as to the pony completely wrapped in casts and bandages! I was wondering if Twilight might sneak in to spy on RD for some reason or another since they had the same color coat. After all,  RD was clearly reading aloud the whole time.
<p></p>And if Larson is responsible for Rarity and Twilight as well as the episodes where Pinkie looks bad,  then it seems he's rather strongly influenced my opinion of the characters.

            I wouldn't put Rainbow in the "most trusting" camp,  and to be fair,  AJ is just as suspicious but more nice about it.]
<p></p>And yes,  a sack of apples.
<p></p>I never even considered that trio to be related,  they just seemed like a group of friends that happened to be bullies.

            Finally saw the episode. Man do I love the animation. Also,  two squees in one episode!
<p></p>Also,  is it just me or are the shows morals have less to do with friendship and more to do with being a good pony? I'm not to surprised by this myself really. I kind of expected Hasbro to run out of friendship specific morals sooner or later.

            I do like how they keep the Aesops broad enough to really cover more then just the one specific instance in the episode. Like this weeks,  the actual Aesop wasn't "reading is great" though that was explicit as well,  but "Don't knock it till you've tried it" And yes the Season 2 morals do seem to be more about just generally being a good pony then about freindship.
