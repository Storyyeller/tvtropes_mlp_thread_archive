            I agree with JT on Games Ponies Play. It,  like Spike at your Service,  has serious issues,  but the humour makes me more leniant.
<p></p>Also,  yeah. The length of the questionnaire makes a big difference to me.

            it's short,  only like four questions,  but they aren't multiple choice.
<p></p>And,  SAYS was the worst episdoe of Season 3 for me. It had good parts,  but the OOC-ness of Spike was just far far to much for me to overlook.
<p></p>Games,  I liked it,  it's lower middle of the pack for me for S3,  yeah it had issues of it's own,  but this time,  the issues were ones I could look past and just enjoy the amazing parts.

            In that case I should be able to answer the questionnaire.
<p></p>My least favourite episode of season 3 was marred by <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDisonance" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDisonance">Values Disonance</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> and even then it wasn't <em>too</em> bad. As I said,  I consider season 3 the most <em>consistently</em> good,  even thouh it didn't have any episodes that totally wowed me like the other two did.

            Hmm,  I seem to be the only one then who wasn't thrilled with Magic Duel. It felt like a list of cliches. Nothing felt surprising or interesting,  just vaguely entertaining.

            I found it pretty meh at best,  really. Trixie to me is most interesting when we <em>don't</em> see her. That is to say,  what she COULD be is much more interesting than what she inevitably is. Or was,  at least. With this appearance the odds of her coming back in an at least semi-amicable role has increased,  but until such a time...
<p></p>She interests me as an antagonist,  but not a villain. In Magic Duel she was a villain(Not to mention the fact that she was really only there in body; the corruption removed her actual character),  so I honestly found her kind of annoying. The rest of the episode... was not much better,  really.

            Eh... a character who's been exaggerated to the point of literal insanity isn't much better than a character taken over. Either way,  the things that interest me about Trixie weren't present until the end of the episode. In her first appearance there was a sort of subtle inconsistency to her character that suggested that there was more going on. Here,  the hammy evil side was played pretty much straightline,  without the subtle cues.

            Sleepless in Ponyville and Magic Duel <em>were</em> my favourite episodes of the season,  but they still don't come close to the top episodes of season 1 and 2 IMO.

            I guess that's just YMMV. I don't think it went too far. My biggest gripe is that the ending was really predictable,  but that's just to be expected with this show.

            I'm kinda on the fence with SAYS.  I don't think they exaggerated his incompetence to the point of OOC ness,  but I think they could have initiated the conflict in a far more interesting way. And yeah,  the resolution was really anticlimactic.  If they would've had him set the thing on fire or something it would've been fine,  but as is it was lackluster.
