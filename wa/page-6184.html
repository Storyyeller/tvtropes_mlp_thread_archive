<p></p>Twilight does have occasional good parts,  but the problem is that the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Romantic Plot Tumor</a> takes up the vast majority of the books. If it weren't for Bella and Edward,  the series would be awesome.

            By the way,  to clarify,  my issue with "Celestia the Tyrant" is not that I think that no one should make fanworks about it (I don't personally enjoy fanworks with such a topic but I wouldn't tell people to not make them) but more when it seems like people are implying that Celestia is that way in the actual show.  I may be taking some fans' joking a bit too literally,  though.

            I liked Jacob up until the fourth book. And Alice was actually kind of fun. Although there's a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> when it comes to her powers... But it's not a good sign when you absolutely hate the two main characters. &gt;&lt;
<p></p>And my hate for Bella and Edward comes from my feminism. They're about the most anti-feminist characters I can possibly think of in the modern world.

There's about a million reasons why I don't like either of them. The villains were not particularly threatening and they sure seem to get sudden plot-induced stupidity really often. I could rant about why the Edward X Twilight romance is not believable at all for a while,  but I'm not even gonna get started.
<p></p>I'm sorry,  just as Pinkie Pie is Ginger's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>,  Twilight is mine.
<p></p>A lot of parts were really gripping though,  I will admit. It's really just the two main characters that bothers me. Why do I even talk about this. I do this waaaay too often. Grrr.... Now I'm angry. I don't think I've felt angry in the longest time. $%@!!@% Stephanie Meyer.

            If you ignore Breaking Dawn the Twilight series is quite readable if you skim over the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Romantic Plot Tumor</a> <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingDawn" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingDawn">Breaking Dawn</a> is just plain shit however.

            I <em>enjoyed</em> reading Twilight,  but I'd never accuse it of being a good book. Generally the minor characters were far more interesting(with the exception of Jacob,  who was the only reasonably developed main character until Meyer realized he was too appealing and made him an asshole out of nowhere.
<p></p>My real problem with the books is that Meyer has the potential to be a very,  very good author - these things were her first forays into writing,  and there's some solid stuff in them. But because they're so popular,  she can ride them for as long as she likes and doesn't really need to improve. I dislike Twilight for turning a potentially skilled author stagnant.

            I honestly don't see ANYTHING to like about Breaking Dawn though.
<p></p>Victoria was bland,  but at least her scheme in Eclipse was decent. (she got beaten far too easily though)
<p></p>but what is there to BD? Where's the tension? As soon as Renesme was born the series should've ended,  there's NOTHING more to this than <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a>-ness from both Bella and Ren.
<p></p>And the bonding thing that Werewolves have piss me off to know end,  especially since it's onsidered a GOOD thing when it happens to Jacob!

I forced myself to be extra lenient on it. She still got a really bad score. It must have been like 70/100 or something around that.
