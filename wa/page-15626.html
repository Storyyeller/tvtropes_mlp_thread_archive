<p></p>That sounds pretty cool.

<p></p>That's what I currently have it as. That would make the first scene a sort of prologue.
<p></p>The other option is to have it as one of the flashbacks.
<p></p>Most of the fic takes place mid-season 3 (soon after Keep Calm and Flutter on)
<p></p>This scene takes place during Dragon Quest (it's the aftermath of Shiny and Cadance announcing their engagement to Celestia.)
<p></p>Most of the rest of the flashback take place about one and a half thousand years ago at the end of Discord's first reign or about three hundred thousand years ago,  when Discord was still a hatchling.

<p></p>Anachronic order can be fun if done right.

            The thing is,  the scenes look like they have like nothing in common.
<p></p>The one is Celestia giving Shining and Cadance a talking to about what it means for an alicorn to marry an ordinary pony and the other is undead ponies deciding to escape the moon.

            <span class="blue">Lol yeah,  I think undead ponies escaping to the moon is much more interesting starting point. It sounds like a prologue already: an inherently confusing yet intriguing premise that promises to be connected to the actual plot somehow later.  Then you can transition into the talk with the 3 royals to establish all their characters and such.</span>

<p></p>Also,  thanks to everybody who commented on that original fiction thing I left here yesterday. I already got a few interesting ideas that I could work into the setting.
<p></p>Also,  I'm the same way with the ordering thing; <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder">Anachronic Order</a> <em>can</em> be used well,  but I don't think it should be unless it enhances the story in some way.   I've seen a lot of cases where people just reordered things for the sake of being complicated and it just ended up making it harder to read rather than enhancing the events.

            I've thought of an idea,  though I'm not sure if it would be funny or stupid. Taking cues from Sweetiebot,  I've thought of recording various screen reader voices for different characters reading the transcripts of the episodes for comedy. For instance,  giving Spike a deep manly voice and Pinkie a hyperactive high-pitched one.

            @Dark: That actually has potential if you use interesting voices.  You could also incorporate <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gizoogle.net/">Gizoogle<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for extra lulz. I Gizoogled a few episode transcripts and the result was amazing.
<p></p>Case in point,  here's the gizoogled version of the opening narration from the pilot:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Back up in tha day,  up in tha magical land of Equestria,  there was two regal sistas whoz ass ruled together,  n' pimped harmony fo' all tha land. Y'all KNOW dat shit,  muthafucka! To do this,  tha eldest used her unicorn powers ta raise tha sun at dawn; tha younger brought up tha moon ta begin tha night. Thus,  tha two sistas maintained balizzle fo' they mackdaddydom n' they subjects,  all tha different typez of ponies. Put ya muthafuckin choppers up if ya feel dis! But as time went on,  tha younger sista became resentful. Da ponies relished n' played up in tha dizzle her elder sista brought forth yo,  but shunned n' slept all up in her dope night. One fateful day,  tha younger unicorn refused ta lower tha moon ta make way fo' tha dawn. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. Da elder sista tried ta reason wit her yo,  but tha bitternizz up in tha lil' onez ass had transformed her tha fuck into a wicked mare of darkness: Nightmare Moon. </div>

            Hey guys I have returned after a gruelling day in Edinburgh and I gotta say,  I'm gonna be very sad that I'll be leaving Scotland because tomorrow is gonna be the last night I spend in my wooden villa before I have to go back to the UK and I don't wanna leave! Anyways I'm gonna go over with what I did today,  I saw some indoor taiko drumming though it was more for my sister I enjoyed it. With energetic and pretty good all round. Then my father wanted to go to Yacht Brittana which was pretty much a tour around a ship,  which I had to carry this 80s telephone esque audio guide because the ship was peppered with signs that told you when to listen to the audio and you had to punch in digit numbers whenever you came across a sign involving a part of the ship.
<p></p>And as you can imagine it was pretty BORING! Most of the time I didn't pay attention to the audio guide or the ship itself and I had to muck around with a bronze statue of a sailor that was there and had to amuse myself with me sticking my finger up it's nose,  I know it's juvenile but come on if that was you and you had to carry around a big plastic telephone of an audio guide around a ship that ya didn't care about and was bored to death of it,  then you'd do the same. Plus I kept on getting thoughts about Rainbow Dash when I was about to go there because I saw more plushies of Rainbow Dash and Twilight Sparkle at another Build-a-Bear.
<p></p>I'm really getting a pattern here and it's quite irrating to say the least! Anyways I tried to block out thoughts of Rainbow Dash while I tried to concentrate on what to get a friend of mine but it was damn impossible....don't ask me why I was thinking about Rainbow Dash,  just don't ask!
<p></p>So out of the whole yacht trip I decided to spend the £10 that I got from my grandma at HMV and got The Goonies,  I'll see it when I get home.
<p></p>Watched a stand up comic for tonight,  pretty hilarious stuff and that's it really.
