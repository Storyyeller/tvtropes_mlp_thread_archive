            Because they only spotlight already popular blogs,  and mine's about as small as it can get.
<p></p>Here's the translation of Ils's article. <div class="quoteblock">Canterlot Ponies react to rumors of a royal pregnancy:
<p></p>Canterlot- An anonymous informant has recently published secret information about Princess Luna. According to our source,  the princess is pregnant. “Ever since she got back from the moon,  the princess almost always has stallions in her room,  that’s why she rarely attends public events like the Grand Galloping Gala, ” he confessed. According to rumors,  Princess Luna rarely leaves her room and orders her subjects to look for males,  and,  at times,  females. Although the rumors have not yet been confirmed by the royal family,  ponies that work in the castle insist that the princess has very little care with her sexual life and never uses protection. The possibility of a new member of the royal family has many important Canterlot ponies concerned. “We don’t know if Nightmare Moon can take care of a baby, ” an anonymous mare told us,  “the princess has not shown that she is a responsible mare. I have very little confidence that she can take care of a colt or filly responsibly. Despite the concerns with the princess,  many other ponies are confident our leader will be a good mother. “I think the princess will not have much trouble taking care of a baby, ” said Fancypants,  the most important Canterlot pony,  “We have to wait and see.” At the present moment,  Stalliongrad Times is looking for confirmation of a Royal pregnancy. - Ilsemmr </div>

            I'm glad I got out of my other job when I did.  I shudder to imagine what April Fools would be like there.  There's several notorious pranksters in my old group,  and I'm related to the biggest April Fool's buff in the entire building. (It's a <em>big</em> building.)

            I don't know what to do with the rest of my night.  I'm all caught up on my fan-fics,  and finished the new issue of the Stalliongrad Times.  I guess I could try writing some of my own fic or working on an ad for the Times,  but I just don't feel like it.

            We at work were too tired and senseless to remember April Fools. This is soul crushing stuff for more reasons than you think.
<p></p>Well at least all the pony April Fools stuff I've seen we're pretty funny. I wonder if for season three for one of their season-related episodes they'll have some sort of kooky prank day.

            Last year,  one of my coworkers got me going for a little bit by implying our branch chief was royally pissed with me.  Of course,  he was actually fine with the work I was doing,  but for about a good ten minutes or so,  I was afraid I'd be called in and let go.

            I work at AMC cinema. At the biggest mall in the area,  which I think last I checked ranked someone In the top 10 biggest malls in the USA. People come from Maryland and DC just to invade and destroy us. Especially weekends obviously. I still hate the Lorax and I am never watching the Hunger Games.

            My brother-in-law (the one I mentioned in my other post) fired one of his employees (the employee was in on it,  but everyone else wasn't) one year.  Another year,  he got my sister,  who works in a vet's office,  to put a cast on his arm,  and he told everyone he broke it by falling off his brother's roof while setting up a prank.

            That's probably a good idea Mousa; The hunger games wasn't that great.

            @ Mousa: <whistles>  Sounds like a terrible place to work.
<p></p>@ Storyyeller: I tried it,  but I have issues with lesswrong and anything that comes from their ideologies.  As you can imagine,  Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality didn't sit well with me,  and that was before I found out who wrote it.  I didn't get past the first couple of chapters.

            John Carter was rather decent,  not going to win awards but I didn't feel as though I wasted my time.

            @ Drenius: It was a good movie,  of the sort that I want to see more of on principle.  Genre works really get a bad rap that needs to be fixed.  It just didn't catch hold of my imagination the way I wish it did though.  And the ending left me feeling a little cheated.
