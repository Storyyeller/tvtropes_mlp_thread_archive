            True dat,  yay for HD videos :D
<p></p>Pinkie knows Fluttershy much better than Cranky,  also at this point she's clearly too desperate to make amends and too stubborn to quit.

            first off,  one of the issues is semantics,  specifically the divergence between what most people/ponies mean my the word friend,  and what Pinkie means by it. her's is a much MUCH more informal definition basically "anypony I know that hasn't said they aren't".
<p></p>Yes she got Cranky to call her freind in the end,  but that is completely unsolicited,  she was fine without it,  at that point her only goal was to fix what she screwed up. And worrying about how she'll act in the future? are you psychic? no,  so wit and see. Point remains,  once she realized she screwed up,  her number one priority was to fix it,  and she DID learn to accept that somepony might not like her and she has to accept that.

            @Arha: The review probably won't be out for 2 or 3 more days due to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> work.  Dang school.
<p></p>@Applelight: Basically I think that her antics passed "misunderstanding" into "WTF".  Essentially,  it neared a point where my suspension of disbelief got stretched to the breaking point.  I just couldn't believe that even Pinkie could be <em>that</em> ignorant of Cranky's feelings.  It passes right over "bad at reading emotions".  It's like she's incapable of even comprehending that he's unhappy,  and I don't think that Pinkie is that callous.  <em>That's</em> what bugs me.  It treats Pinkie as being completely oblivious when she should be able to pick up on <em>something</em>.

<p></p>As I said,  the lengths she went to to apologize showed that she had NO real comprehension as to why Cranky hated her. None whatsoever.

I mean,  the entire middle sequence I was going "Come on,  Pinkie!  You're better than that! Stop being an idiot!"
<p></p>@Ace: That's true,  but it still only justifies so much.  I still think that even she should realize that breaking and entering is wrong in any circumstance.
<p></p>@L Mage: Goodnight.  I'll try to look over that Daring Do chapter tomorrow.  If I forget PM me again or something.
<p></p>Also,  I should just note that for all my complaining,  the episode definitely had some really good stuff in it.  That's why I'm so conflicted over how I feel about it.  Like half the episode made me cringe,  while the other half was awesome.  It's bizarre.
