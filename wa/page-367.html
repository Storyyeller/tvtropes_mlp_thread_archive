I think one criticism was that the conflict wasn't about the main characters so much,  so it was like one of those old G1 cartoons where the ponies were essentially filler characters in their own show.  (But I thought that was kind of the point: Stop trying to fight other people's battles for them!)  Also I bet a lot of folks couldn't get over "What,  really,  PIES as WEAPONS?"

Just the other day I realized why so many fans groaned over reading an early synopsis of "The Ticket Master": <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v59SAx-_F5c">My Little Pony Tales used the same plot!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>  I'll let you decide which show did it better,  though...
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> That being said I don't get where people are getting that the second season will have more of those elements. The only thing that even hinted at that was that there were going to be villains in season two. </div>
And even then,  we can't say what kind of villainy that will be. For all we know,  it could just mean "Messin' with more grumpy dragons."  <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Also I wonder if one reason for Lauren Faust leaving was that she <em>didn't</em> get to change the general direction of the second season at all... but I also wonder if she shouldn't have to keep putting up with wild rumors,  so maybe you should just ignore this thought.</span>

            One thing I love is that the show has it's own rules and a sense of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">Magic A is Magic A</a>. They set up how part of the world works and they stick to it. I especially love how the planet's ecosystem itself seems to be controlled by the ponies,  and the seasons can't even change without their collective help,  and the way they've trivialized the ordeals. (Like Winter to Spring is just a day of hardwork,  and the falling of the leaves in autumn is triggered by a race.) It's just really clever.
<p></p>I kinda want to see an episode where one specific town refuses to change seasons,  and choose to stay in eternal winter or something.

            <div class="quoteblock"> I especially love how the planet's ecosystem itself seems to be controlled by the ponies,  and the seasons can't even change without their collective help,  and the way they've trivialized the ordeals. (Like Winter to Spring is just a day of hardwork,  and the falling of the leaves in autumn is triggered by a race.) </div>
To me it's a little creepy.  Like,  they're saying if those trees didn't receive the proper amount of wind,  the dying leaves would steadfastly cling to them and choke them to death or something?  It just seems like large portions of the world are frighteningly broken if the ponies have to do so much.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Maybe Celestia's doing it on purpose. Why I have no idea,  but it makes for good teamwork-building exercises </div>
Or that's the other scary idea,  that it's mostly just a hoax the rulers of Equestria have pulled over on everyone!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> The planet Equestria is on... DOES NOT REVOLVE! It doesn't revolve,  so the sun and moon need to be manually moved to initiate the day/night cycle,  and it has no tilt,  so seasons cannot naturally occur. </div>
I find it strange that it's easier to move something thousands of times larger,  millions of miles away,  than to just add some rotational velocity to the thing you're already standing on.

            I think the leaf run is just ponies having fun,  not an essential task.
<p></p>Also,  the Sun isn't that big,  it's really rather tiny compared to the world Equestria is on.  Look in the sky sometime,  Rainbow Dash is almost as big as it.

<p></p>I believe so. The ponies don't normally go in there so everything happens naturally,  forever free of manipulation.
<p></p>Though now I wonder if this is because a bunch of monsters live there and everyone's too scared to go in or if its some sort of national park or nature preserve and its illegal for them to do do anything about it.
