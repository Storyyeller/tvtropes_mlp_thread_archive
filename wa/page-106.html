            I dunno,  Pinkie Pie's flaw is pretty clear to me.
<p></p>She does not communicate well.  She either overcommunicates or doesn't communicate at all.
<p></p>Not to mention that taking things seriously is hard for her,  to the point where even when she goes into "srs mode",  she's still taking things humorously.  Look how she acts during the Parasprite invasion.  She makes a non-sequiter (which is LATER proven to be otherwise) and leaves.  What is she like when she's not serious?  Non-sequiter.
<p></p>And the dance.  She failed that dance horribly.  And even after it failed,  she tried the exact.  same.  thing.  One definition of insanity is "Trying the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."
<p></p>So yes,  she's clearly insane.  I would imagine it has something to do with her leading a mind-numbingly boring life and then receiving a brain shock upon seeing the shockwave of the Sonic Rainboom.  It's like going from a room that's freezing cold into a room that's blazing hot.  You'll injure yourself doing that.
<p></p>To be honest,  the only Sue we really have is Celestia,  and even that's justified due to her being dangerously genre savvy,  as well as a freaking deity.  And even then,  she's a prankster troll herself,  so even her Sue-ish traits are done well.
<p></p>So,  long story short,  Lauren Faust is dangerously genre savvy herself,  knows how to avoid a sue,  and when to make a Sue so that she can desconstruct her.

            Nah,  I wouldn't quite call Pinkie a Sue. She doesn't fix everything instantly,  she's not magically beloved by all (even if she seems to love everyone),  and so on. She just seemed closer to the Sue category than Dash. But there really aren't any Sues on the show. Which is a good thing,  because female characters are prone to being Sues in a mad rush to be better than male characters.

<p></p>...Now that you mention it,  the more serious she is,  the sillier she gets.
<p></p>Of course,  if you REALLY think about it... Pinkie Pie in half that episode may have been nothing more than a manifestation of Twilight's dilemma....
<p></p>...Nah.  She used her powers as a cartoon to break space/time to appear in the mirror.

            Alright,  time for a fun thought exercise - for reasons I'm not quite sure of,  today at work my brain decided to play a game of trying to figure out which Pony could be equated to which <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyPrincess" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyPrincess">Disney Princess</a>. My job being what it is,  I figured I might as well play along. I managed to get the following:
<p></p><ul><li>Twilight Sparkel - <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyAndTheBeast" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyAndTheBeast">Belle</a>
</li><li>Fluttershy - <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowWhite" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowWhite">Snow White</a>
</li><li>Pinky Pie - <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tangled" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tangled">Rapunzel</a>
</li><li>Rainbow Dash - <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aladdin" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aladdin">Jasmine</a>(?)
</li></ul><p></p>The last one is real questionable,  while Applejack I don't have a clue,  and Rarity seems harder than it should for some reason.
<p></p>So anyone else up for playing?

            Rarity is what you might expect a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShallowParody" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShallowParody">Shallow Parody</a> of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyPrincess" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyPrincess">Disney Princess</a> would be like. Not really a slight against Rarity,  but let's face it: what Disney Princess was really interested in fashion? In fact,  she actually has the fairly rare occupation of fashion <em>designer</em>,  rather than fashion <em>model</em>.
<p></p>Applejack <em>might</em> be <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrincessAndTheFrog" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrincessAndTheFrog">Tiana</a>,  given the emphasis on hard work.
<p></p>Rainbow Dash is hard,  because while you <em>might</em> think Jasmine or Mulan,  the big difference is that Rainbow Dash's negative traits make it hard to align her with any particular princess.

            See,  Ariel reminds me more of Pinkie Pie. really bubbly and air headed,  to say nothing of the emphasis on singing.
<p></p>I don't think there's ever been a princess that was really arrogant in the way that dash is. I mean,  I'm not really up to snuff on my disney prioncess,  but still,  You'd remember someone like dash in a disney movie.

            How about Applejack as Pocahontas?
<p></p>Though it seems like a disservice to compare them like this,  since the characters seem better fleshed out in this series and subvert a lot of the boring qualities of standard Disney heroines.

            No,  I don't really get a feeling of arrogance from Mulan. For the time she would have been seen as it it,  sure,  but to me she seems pretty far from self-assured in any regard. Of course,  she does have Dash's loyalty,  so that's a point for the comparison.
<p></p>I wouldn't really call the comparison a disservice. Just...odd. The two are separate enough that to me it feels more like comparing ponies to,  say,  world superpower politicians.
<p></p>Which,  let's be honest,  is a hilarious mental image.

<p></p>Can't argue with that. I'm not sure where the idea came from,  it just happened. And I figured that since it's at least half-way relevant,  I might as well share it and see what the response is.
