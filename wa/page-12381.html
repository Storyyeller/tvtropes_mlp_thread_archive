            I wonder if there are any older languages in Equestria? Luna knows an older form or the language,  but are there any other tongues (besides Squirrel,  which Twi doesn't know)?

            @kegi My school was completely bilingual,  with several subjects during the first years given in english,  and anyone with a higher rank than a normal teacher had to be spoken to in english at all times. It seemed to work for me,  but I also happened to play a lot of videogames in english,  so that probably helped.

            Apparently that Rosetta Stone program is pretty effective,  though. My dad used it to learn some Portuguese to better communicate with a bandmate from Brazil,  and he learned a good bit in just a few weeks.

            Oh yes,  that too. I would expect the Gryphons have their own racial language which would be nigh-impossible for ponies to speak in normally,  because pronunciation requires a beak.

            @Lopiny: Ah,  well that's a tad different then. When I say language isn't learned in a classroom,  I mean having someone stand up at the front of the room and tell you to repeat verbs ad-naseum won't teach you. Being taught <em>in</em> another language will help you to learn it,  yes,  because that's how languages are learned: Through use and interaction in a real-world setting
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">givne which,  one wonders how Gilda and Gustav managed to speak equestrian,  mosto f the sounds in which require lips...
<p></p>Also,  Given the advance of language and the fact that Equestria has been around for ofver 1000 years,  I'm going to say there's an 'old equestrian' that's nigh-incomprehensible(The Cantebury tales,  written a mere 600 years ago,  are borderline gibberish to most people)
<p></p>I also tend to think of their being a collection of countries across the sea that didn't interact with mainland equestria for several thousand years,  so they'd likely develop language on their own until first greeted by Equerstrians(Trottingham being where they landed and spread the language to first,  in a delightful reversal). So I imagine in addition to Fancee you might have a sort of nordic equivalent. Pegasi being what they are,  a greek equivalent may exist as well.

            @Kegi: The Crystal Empire appears to using a similar-enough variant of Equestrian that probably dates back to that thousand years back,  and Twi has absolutely no problems with the old books there,  never mind the rest of the Mane Six interacting with the Crystal Ponies without major communication problems.

            I believe Sereg has a theory on Cadence facilitating understanding via magic... but given that Luna had little trouble communicating I imagine you're right on that note. still,  it's very unlikely that the language has <em>never</em> evolved. It's actually possible,  I think,  That Celestia sort of(Pardon the word but it's the most appropriate I can think of,  denotatively speaking) retarded the development of language to help Luna re-integrate when she came back?

            Celestia being around constantly for that thousand years probably stabilized the language and minimized drift.
<p></p>Also the most she seems to have done was discontinue the use of Formal Court Languagethe way Luna used it.

Debugging must be hellish,  though. I have a basic grasp of Java,  and I can already imagine what sort of nastiness would ensue if you misplaced the equivalent of a a decimal point in a particularly elaborate spell.

When she plans a Ponyville "rock" concert to support the family business,  Pinkie's family doesn't like the idea. They just want her to be serious,  for once. This is a real problem! Read along as Pinkie gets a little help from her friends in this original and brand-new adventure!

</div>
<p></p>Looks to be really basic,  considering that it's a paperback aimed at the earliest of readers,  but that premise is something that I think would be really cool to see as an episode. I don't know whether to be impressed by the effort being put into these ideas,  or disappointed that they're going into young children's literature and not the show.

            We've also got more-detailed descriptions of the previously announced bunch of books,  including these two:
<p></p><em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316228192">Twilight Sparkle and the Crystal Heart Spell<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>:
<div class="quoteblock"><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Twilight Sparkle is a very special Pony and a loyal apprentice of Princess Celestia. Twilight Sparkle's life has been turned upside down by recent exciting events in Ponyville,  so she sets off for the Crystal Empire to get advice from her former foalsitter,  Princess Cadance. Join Twilight Sparkle in this original and brand-new adventure!</span>
<p></p>Don't miss the special purple activity pages in the back of the book!</div>
<p></p><em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316245593">Under the Sparkling Sea<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>:
<div class="quoteblock">This gorgeous illustrated picture book features a brand-new My Little Pony underwater adventure,  and includes an exclusive art poster!
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Twilight Sparkle receives an invitation to visit the underwater city of Aquastria,  she invites all her pony friends and Spike to travel with her. The ponies are welcomed by the ruler of Aquastria,  King Leo,  who sits on the Cosmic Council alongside his cousin,  Princess Celestia. There is a long-held rivalry between the seaponies and the mermares. The two groups compete each year in a race for the grand prize,  which is a beautiful pearl. Join the ponies and Spike as they confront danger,  make new friends and race to the finish in this shimmering new world!</span></div>
<p></p>That second one is particularly interesting,  and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">King Leo being Princess Celestia's cousin is kinda funny since he almost has the same name as her other cousin <a class="urllink" href="http://derpiboo.ru/images/10088">Léon<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue"></span>
