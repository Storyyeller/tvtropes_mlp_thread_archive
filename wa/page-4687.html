            So is the Sparkle family (I'm assuming that is the Surname for Twi's whole family) royalty? Why is this not better established? And I guess now the WMG page for this show is about to be severely taxed or burdened.

            Funny thing is I always imagined Twilight as someone having a <em>younger</em> brother for whatever reason...
<p></p>Yes its a rumor,  but I guess we can have some fun with speculation.
<p></p>We don't know <em>anything</em> about Shining Armor beyond that he's getting married to royalty and he is more than likely named for <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a>. Is he in the Equestrian military? Is Twilight's family in fact nobility (or otherwise "very important ponies"),  and thus <em>why</em> they were able to get Twilight in the door at an (presumably) extremely prestigious magic school in the first place?
<p></p>If he is her brother...would of been nice if he cameo'd in "Cutie Mark Chronicles" (though its doubtful they were planning this far ahead). Still,  this might mean we'll see Twilight's parents again and find out exactly <em>who</em> they are beyond being G1 pony expies.

            I'll leave for a while in hope that some more proof for or against this will surface while I'm gone.
<p></p>Not to sound jaded,  but don't get too excited. Remember what happened last time something everyone thought was going to be true ended up false...
<p></p>(I realize this might be harder to falsify,  but still)
<p></p>And in the case that it is true,  I hope all goes well for Twi's brother.

            @L Mage:  The conversation kind of moved on while I was away,  but what I was trying to say was that while there are very competent villains,  they spend a lot of the series in the background being sneaky.  For large portions of the series we focus on the villains who are being undermined by their inability to work together.
<p></p>@Ginger:  While I absolutely respect your taste in villains,  and by no means am trying to tell you that you should read stuff that has incompetent ones,  you don't need to freak out over a discussion of incompetent villains in a work you aren't even following.
<p></p>And now,  in more topical news:  Huzzawhaaaaa?  Damn that came right out of left field.

            DA FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
<p></p>Okay,  I'm good. I'm cool.
<p></p>SO! Shining Armor is Twilight's brother. Iiiiiiinteresting considering how wildly different his colour scheme is when compared to hers and her parents... maybe he's a half-brother?
<p></p>I don't think he's ever explicitly stated to be a prince,  but I guess he will be now... Interesting if Cadence is actually related to the sisters,  Twilight becomes in-laws with her mentor. now THAT could be funny. You just know that Luna is all about good family values.
<p></p>Luna: SISTER! we have come to visit you,  as our in-laws are concerned for you well being. We bring CARE PACKAGES! With COOKIES!
<p></p>Twilight: Princess? It's 3 in the morning!
<p></p>Honestly though I'm just looking forward to seeing how Twi acts around him. I can't really imagine her with a sibling,  honestly,  let alone a big brother. Plus it gives us time to see her parents in action! Mr. Sparkle is going to be awesome,  I just know it. I'm pretty curious about this 'surprise' she dug up as well... I wonder if Shining Armour himself is the surprise? Or Cadence's nature (I hope neither,  since it sort of ruins the surprise for us...)?
<p></p>Welp... nothing to say but EXCITED!

            Okay,  I'm looking at a picture of shining armor and Twi's parents.
<p></p>Totally probable.

            @Red Savant: Keep in mind that she's lived at a boarding school for most of her life; she probably doesn't interact with her brother on a regular basis like AJ and Rarity do with Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle.

            Do we even know that she didn't live at home?  Yeah she studied with Celestia,  but she already lived in Canterlot didn't she?  It isn't like we've seen more than about ten seconds of her parents who she's never mentioned again,  so the brother thing isn't completely implausible.

            Twilight doesn't seem like the type to have siblings at all,  it's one of those personality traits you can just tell,  especially if you've had some yourself.
<p></p>No inferiority complex,  no superiority complex,  no advice nor preconceived notions,  no special or particular thoughts or feelings about family,  Apple Bloom,  Sweetie Belle,  or anything.
<p></p>I mean,  lets face it,  this almost seems shoehorned in,  like they needed to justify the cast going to this wedding.

            No,  we're not told anything about Shining Armor (until now I guess,  but again rumor). He'll <em>become</em> a prince when he marries Cadence,  but he presumably isn't since he's always been referred to as Shining Armor in marketing as opposed to Prince Shining Armor.
<p></p>Its never said if it was a boarding school,  but its <em>Celestia's</em> School for <em>Gifted</em> Unicorns,  which requires an intense entrance exam for <em>foals</em> to enter. It can only be presumed its a school meant for the best of the best. Or have the most money.
