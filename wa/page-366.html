            I like doing that. It shows just how easy it is to sound as if you're implying something you're not,  and in some cases it's unavoidable.
<p></p>As for the CM thing,  I think that has potential for some drama. Angst over finding your place in society. I think it ought to be worked into the show in the form of the CMC. Maybe one of them gets a mark,  but doesn't like the job it bequeaths them? There is a lot of potential in that. It has already been established there is prejudice against those who don't receive one,  imagine what a social aberration it must be to have received one and not going along with it.

That's part of why the CMC continue to fail (other than the fact that if they succeeded,  their niche in the show would disappear); they're just trying all sorts of random stuff rather than just stopping to think "I like doing this,  and I'm good at it".
<p></p>I think the real drama potential here is if one of the CMC got their cutie mark,  but the others didn't.  It would be an interesting way to drive a wedge into the group.
<p></p>Also,  I really don't know whether an overarching plot is a good idea.  On one hand,  I like the show the way it is,  but then again there's a lot of potential for <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>.  As long as they don't through the characterization and humor under the bus I don't see a problem with it.

            Well yes,  I once said <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a> was a perfect model of an communist sovietic village too. But it would be hard pressed to say that the author wanted to carry this message... and so for the ponies.
<p></p>Juste watched two more episode. I try to pin-point exactly what's attracting me to the show... Well,  the animation is <em>gorgeous</em> for a vector-based look,  that's for sure. Moves are smooth,  natural,  there's always something moving in the background. Definitively a plus.
<p></p>Second,  characters have really defined profiles and attitudes. It's really easy to pick your favourite one right from the beginning. I'm affraid they would become very one-sided and flat,  but so far it's okay. And even with those almost caricatural personnalities,  watching them interact is never tedious or phoned-in.
<p></p>I don't know,  honestly. Plots are pretty much easy to read,  it could predict the end of the episode after a few minutes only; conflicts are so generic and obvious anyone could see. Yet,  I still want to see what's next. I'm enjoying this far more than I should do.
<p></p>I think I should watch a few more episodes to understand it more... Maybe I'll take notes. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">

            It's interesting to speculate,  but no one is 'assigned' a cutie mark that they don't like.  It's finding out what you love to do,  your calling,  so to speak,  that triggers your cutie mark.  As far as we  know,  they don't have any influence on what ponies like to do; the calling causes the cutie mark,  not the other way around.
<p></p>Still,  I do expect an episode on one of the Crusaders getting her mark and making the other two jealous in S2.

I always felt that the characters and the setting were flexible enough to accommodate all kinds of stories.
<p></p>That being said I don't get where people are getting that the second season will have more of those elements. The only thing that even hinted at that was that there were going to be villains in season two.

Seriously? Applebloom's classmates all have theirs,  so that's what it must mean. I don't think you <em>can</em> know what you want to do at that young an age.

            @talden: In terms of the obvious plotting,  keep in mind the primary audience.  Most of us know what's going to happen from miles away because we're all <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> tropers.  The show is geared towards children who don't have nearly that ability to see what's coming.

It's not like you randomly get assigned one.  The cutie mark doesn't appear unless you already know what you want to do.  It's impossible to get stuck with one that you don't want.  The other thing is that the cuties marks are usually generic enough that they could apply to several "callings".  It's not like they get labelled with a specific job; just a general area.  The other other thing is that horses in Equestria obviously develop differently than humans do.  Maybe they figure out their lives faster.

            ^^There's a reason everypony always tells the Crusaders that it's alright to wait and find out.  And it can be very loose,  it seems; all the Apple clan ponies have apple variants,  but they all do a lot more than just buck apples and make pies.  It seems to indicate the core of your personality more than it does your future profession,  in truth.  I mean,  Pinkie's a baker,  but her core is fun.
<p></p>^Exactly.  It's not like you're assigned a job in elementary school; it <em>is</em> that you discover what you truly want to do for the rest of your life.

            I wonder if there's a scientific term for CMs that biologists use so that they don't sound stupid.
<p></p>It's tough to have a serious scientific debate where the words 'Cutie Mark' are being used repeatedly.

<p></p>Although It's just a blanket statement anyway.  I really don't think most of the plots themselves are predictable,  just that is isn't that tough to figure out "oh,  this episode is going to be about (moral lesson)".  And even then,  there are quite a few exceptions.
<p></p>EDIT: <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">This is a thread about a children's tv show where we use phrases like "everypony" and "mane cast" in complete seriousness.  At this point I just sort of lean back and treat the serious debates about Cutie Marks as absurdist comedy.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            Some people say you can identify a person's personality from a very young age,  but even if not,  remember,  these are PONIES.  Is it really that small a fraction of their life?  Or a larger portion of a shorter life?  (Celestia aside,  she is immortal or something!).

            Going off the lifespans and such for ponies in real life,  apparently Applebloom and the other Crusaders would be around two,  while Twilight and the rest of the mane cast are between four and five,  or so I think was the opinion stated.

            Japanese Teeth: That's my point. When a plot is obvious and cliché,  I end up groaning and rolling my eyes a lot. But here,  those same plots are handed quite efficiently,  and it doesn't leave me with a bitter impression.
