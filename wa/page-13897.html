<p></p>I think this is awesome. There need to be more stories about princesses rescuing guys. (That said,  it shouldn't go to the extreme of making guys useless either.)

            Thats kinda why I was a little upset with Twi becoming a princess.  I just felt it was dumbing things down a bit... like the only way to be useful as a girl is to be a pretty princess.
<p></p>I know the writers are going to try and turn that trope on its head but.... will it really get through to kids?

            Its still a Princess... it just leaves an icky taste in my mouth.
<p></p>You could stick a Tiara and jewelry on a PHD and call them a Princess... and it would somehow cheapen it for me.  They'd still be a PHD but the requirement of the pretty factor bugs me.

            <em>I think this is awesome. There need to be more stories about princesses rescuing guys. (That said,  it shouldn't go to the extreme of making guys useless either.)</em>
<p></p>While not exactly the same premise,  I've always wanted to make a game about a guy saving a guy. Except you don't <em>know</em> you're saving a guy right until the very end. And all the way along everyone you meet tells you it's a terrible idea and you should just give up already,  because you shouldn't have ever been together in the first place. So you go through all this bullshit and,  ideally,  it only hardens your resolve to save what you assume is a princess,  and then it turns out,  OH WAIT,  SO THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE PEOPLE SAY YOU SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO BE IN LOVE
<p></p>Buuuuuut like I said,  that's a whole <em>other</em> issue I have with the gaming fanbase in general... the trope of a princess saving a guy is actually entertaining enough on it's own,  and I always love seeing more well-done female protagonists. I just finished playing <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondGoodAndEvil" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondGoodAndEvil">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a> recently,  and Jade is probably one of my favourite video game protagonists ever.

            That is kind of why I like to play some of the Sandbox games like Skyrim.  They have made it so you can technically play a gay character if you want to.  It doesn't really affect the storyline or anything but you can marry a guy or a girl and nobody really cares.
<p></p>In one of the quests I did recently there was a dead male Nord in the basement of this house,  and if you wander down along the shoreline you find another dead male Nord with a letter from the first.. and an amulet of Mara which is basically a wedding ring in that world.  It was nice to see something like that for a change.

            Has anyone played interactive fiction? Regardless,  there's a game called Jigsaw that's interesting when it comes to gender. As part of the plot,  you chase a look-alike rival through various time periods to prevent a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash">Time Crash</a>. This rival is given just an ambigious enough description that you never learn his or her gender,  so it can be whatever you like. The game has many hints that he or she is infatuated the protagonist,  but none of this becomes obvious until you've finished the game.

            @Kegisak: It's certainly an interesting idea,  although I can't help but think that doing it that way would result in enormous amounts "YOU TRICKED ME INTO PLAYING AS A FAGGOTOFOSIDFJPOBNBND:!!!i!!"-style rage from a lot of people.  I'd be cool with a game having the premise of a dude saving a dude,  but I'd much rather the game be upfront about it rather than springing it on me at the end.  Honestly,  I think it would make all of the other responses more interesting because throughout the game the double-standard would be repeatedly discussed. Like if you wanted to be meta about it,  there could be like a "princess-rescuing" guild or something,  and the protagonist is trying to get into it even though he's saving a guy.
<p></p>@Ms CC: Welcome to the <strike>insanity</strike> thread. I hope you enjoy your stay.
<p></p>Anyway,  I really don't see how you can interpret FIM as sexist against females unless you <em>really</em> reach.  The great majority of authority figures are females,  and for the most part they're all portrayed as high competent in their given disciplines.  Sure they're girly and flawed <em>sometimes</em> but on the whole they're realistic and strong characters.

            See,  the reaction is the key,  though. The game would never 'trick' you into believing you were saving a woman,  it would simply be playing off of people's assumptions. The idea is that you'd get attached to this guy's journey,  assuming it was normal,  and then it would be sprung on you that he's gay,  and ideally that would make someone confront the question: Where is the difference? The hero still went to every single length for his love that the 'straight' hero went to. He still overcame every single obstacle. With all that,  what makes his love any less genuine or legitimate?
<p></p>Perhaps it's a bit naive to assume that would make anyone change their mind,  and perhaps being upfront and talking about the double standard openly would be a easier route,  but at the same time I think it would narrow the audience significantly,  especially in that it would cut off exactly the kind of people I want to see the game. The core of the idea is the experience of feeling true,  genuine love,  and then being told for an ultimately arbitrary reason that it wasn't 'good enough'. The game would be peppered with a lot of subtle problems homosexuals go through - for example,  one of the final bosses would be a character who starts off as a friend.
