            Once again,  I must wonder at Flutershys purpose in going to sugarcube corner. What was everyone in line for? Why did pinky find the idea of pink punch so amusing? We'll never know,  since Flutershy just freaks out and leaves.
<p></p>oh man,  I never realized how close new!Flutershy comes to dropping an fbomb. Stuff that nopony gives a flying feather about,  huh? Heck,  maybe that <em>is</em> an fbomb in pony parlance.
<p></p>I still maintain that Iron Will really is a good guy at heart,  and that minotaur culture is just really rough and tumble. His advised behavior is perfectly acceptable,  and even expected,  where he's from!
<p></p>Say,  Iron Will didn't get a character card,  did he?

            I have to say,  though,  that despite the fire completely messing up Sunday,  the overall experience was great.  I'd be willing to say it was one of the funnest things I'd ever done.  Especially since Friday I ended up in the back of a cab with not only Tara Strong,  but also Lauren Faust. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">

            Swas: Yea,  luck is pretty much the only way to describe it.
<p></p>Jakes: Hehe,  sure.  I was at the meet and greet on Friday and Tara Strong had not been provided gift carriers like she demanded.  I was there with a couple others from the Artist Training Grounds group and she conscripted two of them (who happened to be the two I knew best too) one after the other to just hold her stuff.  Well,  after the meet and greet ended,  she didn't take her stuff back.  This ended in me walking beside her and my guest just a little behind us as the group headed out the lobby.
<p></p>Since my guest (Invidlord for those of you familiar with the ATG names) still had Tara's stuff,  we ended up at the same cab as her and Invid ended up in the front seat.  And that's how I ended up in the back seat beside Tara and Lauren.
<p></p>But it gets even better.  During the drive,  aside from the extra chance at idle banter,  Tara decided this was the point at which she would make Lauren get a Twitter.  They ended up fumbling with it a bit since Lauren had an app that Tara wasn't used to using and by the time we reached the restaurant,  they still hadn't quite figured it out.  So imagine this: we're in the lobby to a fancy restaurant and the waiter is waving us up to the VIP room and the two of them are fumbling around with Lauren's phone and Tara insisting they're too busy to go upstairs yet. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_evilgrin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="evil grin" title="evil grin">

Pretty much this. Damn. That must've been great. If she picked two others,  why were you in the cab with them? Although you might have explained that and I just missed it. It's pretty late right now. <br> <br>Also,  this note is unrelated and for J Teeth. That ketchup machine video you shared a few days ago was just on TV. I have no idea why,  but I thought you'd like to know.

            Ed: Well,  I'd met Tara already at Comic-Con,  but she was as approachable as ever.  She is very much a performer even off-stage.  She'll change into random voices or yell for emphasis to be goofy.  Although less so when she was messing with Lauren's Twitter.
<p></p>Lauren is less extroverted than Tara (and de Lancie),  but was still very talkative most of the night.
<p></p>And as for the Twitter,  yes,  I was there as history was being made. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_evilgrin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="evil grin" title="evil grin">
<p></p>Swas: Sorry,  guess I should've elaborated more.  She only chose them one at a time,  so she briefly took her stuff back from the first and then passed it off to Invid.  Plus the first guy wasn't in on the supper,  so he had to stay behind.
<p></p>EDIT: Cookoo: In total,  a fair amount.  In the cab not quite as much as I could have thanks to the Twitter inception.  But at the supper we had a chance to share interests and stories.

            Holy crap Kuroi,  that is amazing.  I don't think I'd be very good in that situation,  I'd be trying to hard not to fangasm all over both of them.

On Sat at the private signing,  Lauren complimented the detail in my main six plus Spike drawing that I got her to sign (I'm too tired to scan it yet,  but have <a class="urllink" href="http://sta.sh/07g6t072zu5">a low quality photo<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for now).

<p></p>Anyway,  I need to sleep,  but I'll probably try to write as much as I can remember into a journal and then link you guys to it.
