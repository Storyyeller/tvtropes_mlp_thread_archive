            Well,  yeah,  that was kind of an extreme example.  Somehow,  I'm entirely fine with it being a projection of the heat from the mage's body... but stuff like Redcloak's titanium elementals bothers me. *shrug*  Guess it's just me.

            @Red: I suppose that makes sense. I actually seem to recall reading a series where magic was Theurgical,  basedon making pacts with spirits. There was a school of magic,  and it seemed that most of what was taught there was the proper way to call spirits,  and the right words to use in pacts. Presumably so they can't fuck you over with it. I mean,  I still feel like if you went a level deeper than that there'd still be physical laws,  but... eh.
<p></p>Still,  I want to poke a little bit more about what you think of the 'runes as chemicals/events' idea. The way I'd described my image of magic in the ponyverse is that 'magic' is and does everything by flowing in different shapes and patterns,  and ponies make magic by grabbing hold of the current on forcibly molding it into those patterns. The more complex the pattern the harder the spells,  sort of thing,  and 'unnatural' processes require stringing a lot of shapes together. Just trying to get a feel for if that's still too 'scientific',  or if it's 'magic' enough. Idle curiosity,  really.

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Ok,   now  that I am finally on a proper PC I can get this out.
As I said back on my previous post I wanted to share my thoughts about the news I read this morning,   well not the news itself (could careless if it is sincere or a rouse,   time will make that clear) but the comments that were posted below is what stirred my interest and got me to really think or contemplate this fandom some. I think in order to set up what I am about to say I should state how I became a brony myself to put this in context.
<p></p>I had not really been "on" the internet for sometime (being consumed by Real Life) but I still checked on some of my favorite sited periodically,   which in Cracked.com where I came across this article on <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographics" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographics">Periphery Demographics</a>. After initial readings  of it I was not really drawn to MLPFIM out of curiosity/discuss/interest at all,   what peaked my interest was the entry on Lionel Richie's popularity in the Middle East. So when I looked down to the comments section to see some of the typical funny/stupid remarks on that I was somewhat surprised to see the argument going on about Bronies as I thought mysel that it would get slammed and people would move on but this was different. I had never seen so many people of a "niche group" argue back so ferociously like that. It wasn't like the typical flame war that breaks out there and it seemed to overshadow almost all of the other topics that were discussed there (with the exception of yaoi-ism among middle-age women) and it left me puzzled but I didn't think much and went on to something else.  A round two weeks later I remembered the article and took another look at it out of curiosity,   and people were still commenting on this one group! Now I knew were I would have to go to understand this phenomenon...This Wiki,   which I have been on for about 4 years this February (although I was basically lurking for the first 2 years,   still need to make a troper page). It blew my fucking mind how detailed and catalogued this show had been; I had came to TV Tropes from an Anime forum and Ihad seen a few Troped out and re-troped pages in my time but it had been a while since I saw something like this. I must have spent at least 2 and a half hours reading everything before finally deciding to watch the first episode and give the show a shot,   of course by then I was a brony and didn't even know it.
<p></p>Sorry for the long post! I will now attempt to put this whole thing in context by sharing my thoughts on the responses to the 4Chan news and the implications I think it may or may not have on the fandom's future as well as what may become of bronism in the future regardless. (I know most will state that this is not a big deal,   or nothing to think much of but...I still wish to share these thoughts somewhere and being a troper I thought of this place first. Also I study a lot on history and philosophy so my view on things are usually long,   detailed,   and some what exisitential(think Kierkegaard not Nietzsche)) Also since I 'm doing a lot of typing I will not be able to immediately respond to any replies to this post until my follow-up post. Please just bare with me on this friends and I will have it all out of my system by my next post.

            I see it that there's still detailed physics involved in magic,  but only because there's detailed physics involved in <em>everything</em>. A baseball pitcher isn't consciously manipulating the chemical energy of their cells to kinetic energy to contract their muscles and transferring that energy to the baseball they're throwing. Those things still happen,  but they're not what the pitcher is concerned with. He's concerned with his technique. A wizard probably casts spells the same way.

            That tumblr went with the obvious "Scootaloo is an orphan" fanon.  Scoots is 13,  still a blank flank,  and is being raised by her foster parent Sandy Soles.  Or Sandy Shoes.  Or Sandy Hooves.  Or whatever the hay the writer decides her last name is this week.

            I took a look at it. Skimmed the first page.  Went through half a dozen posts before hitting anything that wasn't DRAMA and it wasn't until the very last post on the page that I hit something that wasn't an OC or <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCStandIn" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCStandIn">OC Stand In</a>.  Doesn't help that most of the drama isn't really anything you wouldn't find on just about any teen-oriented TV show.  I guess it isn't <em>bad</em> per se as it raises the question of why it's even a pony thing.  Most of the characters are OC's and Scootaloo doesn't really seem like herself.
<p></p>TL;DR I have no real reason to read it because outside of the fact that they're ponies it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the show.

            Exciting the atoms,  causing a spontaneous rection,  projecting heat,  summoning fire from a different dimension,  I'm fine with all of it. But I still prefer to think of our physics as <em>existing</em> if being incomplete. Plus I tend to regard these things as like reaity unless I have a reason to think otherwise.
