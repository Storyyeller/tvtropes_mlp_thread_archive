            @Whatshisgame: I like to consider Minuette (sp?) to be Colgate's last name. (Worked with Lyra and like in that case,  it makes a cool full name that actully exists.)
<p></p>@Ginger: In my fanfic's canon,  the bridesmaids were brainwashed because they actually knew Cadance fairly well,  having been foalsat by her themselves and started to question why she as acting oddly. Chrysalis decided that brainwashing them into acting as guards and getting new bridesmaids would probably have a better effort/payoff ratio than trying to keep them calm and risking having one blow her cover.

            Ahh... hmm yea you do have to install Steam to be able to acess the files.  Technically the copy of the game I have is DRM free so I could concievably just send you that,  but you'd still have to install the game and stuff.
<p></p>Steam does store your games and purchases on their server so I *think* if you made a login on their site,  then downloaded the client onto your home PC later you'd be able to log in and get the game that way too.
<p></p>In short I can login to steam on my laptop or desktop and be able to download and install any of my purchases to either machine whenever I fancy.

            Well I do have a steam account now,  it's manatherindrell,  but I can't install it on any computer I use because you need administrator rights. If the game is DRM free,  I might be able to install <em>that</em> on my portable hard drive.

            My dad is a professional musician,  so I have access to any recording and editing equipment/software that I would need. What I don't have is privacy to actually record or an idea of what I would ever want to record in the first place,  vocal or otherwise.

<p></p>That said,  a sort of mini arc in which a character is more or less <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> for a short while,  giving opportunity for another character to take the spotlight while <em>simultaneously</em> allowing for solo episodes in a new setting starring the character put on the bus would be quite interesting. It'll never happen,  but it's something to think about.
