            Okay,  leaving for real after this,  but:
Crowind: That could work.  I was also thinking the injury could have happened more recently.  So up until then both parents were working together as an unstoppable treasure hunting duo.  With mama Do permanently injured and the kids all grown up,  she feels too guilty to confront them right away.  Same with papa Do,  but the one story will force him and Daring together.
<p></p>Ginger: Don't make me pull out the fainting couch clip again.  Seriously.  I care about Derring.  In fact,  I'm even growing pretty attached to her the more I work on this outline. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            That would totally be a plot point.

We could have it so the clues are ambiguous as to whether the Crown is made of precious metal or is an important histoical relic of one of the foundrs of Classical Equestria,  at least initially.

            I would assume that if there is a "chose poorly" moment in the books,  it would be in Griffin's Goblet.
<p></p>As for the crown: The metal is important because it's precious and valuable. The princess is important as one of the founders of Equestria and probably a powerful Princess besides.
<p></p>I wonder if "Platinum Crown" or "Crown of Platinum" would be a more meaningfully ambiguous wording...

            So we're all set in making both parents completely irresponsible,  then? Sounds fun.

<p></p>Daring and Derring can do this with ancient artifacts to identify how old they are,  what material they're made of,  and the history of the area in which they were found. Early in The Platinum Crown Daring and Derring get into a Scan battle to identify a slab of stone that had recently been put on display in a local museum.
<p></p>I'm not sure if you included that,  Mage. But I hope you did XD

            @ginger: I have a soft spot for older siblings who are forced to take care of their younger siblings. Though,  granted,  I also forgot that Derring wasn't just snarky-Jerkass but also abandoning-jerkass,  so that depends on how much that's played up. Why did you ask? I thought you liked her.
<p></p>OK,  I'm off.

            @Crow A big point though is that,  unlike her parents,  Derring never abandons her siblings until they're actually capable of living by themselves. She resented it,  but she never left them all alone. She raised them right. She didn't even come between Daring and her love of exploring even though the sight of her younger sister developing the same passion she has served as a constant reminder of the life she was missing out on.
<p></p>Dammit. I missed Crow!
