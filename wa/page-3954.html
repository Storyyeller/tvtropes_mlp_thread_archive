            @ Ginger: Don't worry about it.  I miss obvious details myself all the time,  as I've found out once again in this thread today.
<p></p>@ Kegisak: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Diamond Tiarra was a mid-level manager at a prison when the balefire bombs started going off.  Everyone else fled and she had to make the call wether or not to free the prisoners.  She waited too long to make the call,  and after she let the prisoners out the prison went into lockdown mode.  She hid in a closet for a few days,  and the prisoners started turning to cannibalism (don't remember if they went ghoul or were just starving).  She accidentally made a noise and got discovered,  so instead of letting herself get eaten,  she decided to commit suicide with a gun she had. (I think it only had one shot.)</span> I haven't read that part since my first time through,  so I'm just running off memory here.  Some of the details might be wonky.

            well that part that drives it home and really made me sad for her was she spends the last few days analyzing her life and realizing all the times she screwed up. If she had managed to get out she probably would have been a better pony for the epiphany.
<p></p>and no that isn't the average darkness level,  that is one of the darkest things that happen in the whole fic.

            @Red I've grown desensitized to most of the stuff in the fic by this point. Really,  chapters 2 and 3 were the worst.
