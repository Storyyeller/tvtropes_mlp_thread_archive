            I'd say Rainbow has gotten a big boost this season. Rarity is lagging behind though. No episodes,  no chance to Shine.
<p></p>1) Twilight is still best pony
<p></p>2) Rainbow is REALLY doing much better after Season 2 tried it's best to make her a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerk Ass</a>.  Now she's what I wanted her to be. A loyal brave pony.
<p></p>3) Fluttershy. I really liked "Keep Calm and Flutter On". It shows that she is actually learning her lessons from "Keeping your Hoof Down".
<p></p>4) Rarity hasn't actually gotten worse for me. It's just she faces steeper competition. I'm hoping we see much more of her in Season 4. She needs at least three episodes to keep up.
<p></p>5) Pinkie actually facing some real conflicts in "Too Many Pinkie Pies" make that my favorite episode from a story perspective.  And she's been toned down from Season 2 "constantly annoying all the time" Pinkie. I think she's at her best when she'd comic relief,  just bringing her own perspective to serious situations.
<p></p>6) Applejack. She got some new episodes this season but "Apple Family Reunion" was just "meh" to me. I do like her in "Spike at your Service" but not a lot of new ground was broken with that episode. The latter does give her lots of badass points though.

            <div class="quoteblock">Anyone else's rankings change over Series 3? </div>
<p></p>My last ranking change was in season 2,  but Fluttershy has been rapidly approaching Twilight and I can tell you that she <em>will</em> overtake Twilight if early season four goes n a irection I dislike. And the last time that they were this close together was early season 1.
<p></p>Of the Mane 6:
<p></p>1. Twilight
<p></p>2. Fluttershy
<p></p>3. Applejack
<p></p>4. Rainbow Dash
<p></p>5. Rarity
<p></p>6. Pinkie Pie
<p></p>Last change was a switch between RD and AJ. Rarity probably <em>deserves</em> to be higher,  but she was hurt by my prejudices and the fact that she only really got to shine later in season 1. And that as I grow to like her more,  I grow to like the others more as well.

            My order hasn't really changed much.  Twilight is still best pony,  followed by Rarity.  The other four are pretty variable depending on the episode.
<p></p>In regard to Pinkie specifically,  it's really hard to make up my mind on her.  When episodes focus on developing her character (Party of One,  Baby Cakes,  TMPP) she has a great amount of depth and is incredibly interesting. The problem is that in any episode that doesn't specifically focus on her characterization,  all that subtlety pretty much evaporates.  All the other characters maintain some of the nuance in other episodes,  but with Pinkie she tends to basically just be comic relief when she isn't directly involved in the plot.

            I will say that between "Hurricane Fluttershy" and "Wonderbolts Academy" I like Rainbow Dash a lot more than I used to.
<p></p>The only <em>major</em> change in how much I like a character is that when I first got into the show Rarity was one of my least favorite characters.  I liked her a bit more after rewatching the first season,  but season 2 bumped her up to near the top.

            I agree on the Pinkie issue. She's not a bad character by any means,  but she could due with more characterization. For me the worst point where the show takes her side is in Feeling Pinkie Keen where she borders on a Sue. In that episode in particular,  nothing Twilight does will change the fact that the episode is clearly against her and when Pinkie ever seems to be in favor of the writers,  she's never wrong The only time Pinkie's characterization is given a deconstructionist. tone is Party of One. It really makes her stand out in contrast to the others who have all had their more negative traits rounded out with growth and learning from their mistakes.

            That's what I think about about Pinkie too.  Heaven knows I love her,  but seriously,  her negative traits should be explored and worked upon more often,  without the universe cutting her an easy one.
<p></p>It's probably awful for me to at it,  but I would like an episode exploring her gluttony. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_wink.png" height="16" width="16" alt="wink" title="wink">

            We're ranking the Mane 6 and discussing Pinkie?  My rankings are in four groups:
<p></p><ul><li> 1st place: Twilight (for now)
</li><li> 2nd place: Applejack and Pinkie (often fighting with Twilight for first place)
</li><li> 3rd place: Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy
</li><li> 4th place: Rarity (I still like her,  I just happen to like the other 5 more)
</li></ul><p></p>If other characters are allowed in there,  I would put Sweetie Belle up around 2nd place,  potentially fighting with Twilight for 1st.
<p></p>About Pinkie,  I think the reason she's endeared herself to me so much is because she reminds me of my dog Luna so much,  personality-wise.  Or at least what one would get if Luna (the dog) was crossed with the Warner kids from Animaniacs,  since Pinkie is probably much more hyper than Luna,  who can be pretty good at being calm and relaxed.  (Luna basically has two modes,  friendly and excited and friendly and calm.)  I could easily imagine Luna the dog singing the Smile song if she could talk and sing.  And she has a similar "everyone is a potential friend!" attitude to Pinkie.
<p></p>Pinkie probably could stand to have some more times where she has to face the consequences of her actions,  although I personally think that has happened,  like with the Too Many Pinkies thing or when she found out in Baby Cakes that babysitting is a lot different than simply being a friend to the babies (which is one of my favorite Pinkie episodes).  And it has been shown that she is capable of learning from her mistakes and applying what she learned,  like when Twilight taught her how to actually look for clues in the cake mystery story and then she applied that knowledge to identify the ones who ate the other three entries at the end.  Probably the big test for her would be if Cranky showed up again and they showed that she learned something about respecting privacy (although the idea of actually liking privacy is probably difficult for her to comprehend).

<p></p>Yeah,  we're undead.  And when we die,  there's a chance of us becoming <em>un</em>-undead.  And if a zombie is bitten by one of the unundead,  then they'll become unundead as well.
