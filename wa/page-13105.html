            actaully,  no there is very little of "ponies dying horribly, " at least on screen,  there is actaully very little gore after you make it through the first raider nest in cahpter 4,  which is the worst the fic gets as far as that goes and is there to shock the reader and Li'lpip,  with just how BAD the wastes are,  as well as getting a rather gorey and disgusting imag of the nest out of the way,  so that later,  the author can just make a few cague refrences and let your mind fill in the rest.
<p></p>the Mane 6 did not cause the apocalypse,  the closest to actually doing anything was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fluttershy,  and that was developing a means amplifying spells greatly and making megaspells,  that she intended to be used for healing and defensive spells,  but were perverted in Balefire Bombs and others.</span> the rest simply did their best to win and survive a two decade long war,  when no living pony had ANY experience in warfare or how to deal with a war,  resulting in them making almost every mistake imaginable simply because they didn't know better.
<p></p>And even in their mistakes,  their darkest hours,  even when everything they did ultimitly failed,  there were left seeds,  seeds of hope,  of promise,  seeds that would come from that which doomed Equestria,  and become that which would save it,  allow it to be reborn. in their worst errors,  there darekst decisions,  they planted seeds that would bloom in time to heal Equestria and allow ponies to once more be ponies,  each of the mane 6 left somehing,  some hope,  some seed...all save Twilight,  for instead of a single seed she created The Gardens in which those seed could flourish.
<p></p>Yes i LOVE that story,  wholly and completely and would recommend ANYONE to read it. yes it is not something everyone will like,  but long as you don't go in TRYING to hate it and willfully twist everything to meet you idea of being bad,  it is well worth at least trying,  because while yes it is dark,  it is grim,  it does have some rather horrible things,  all of that,  ALL OF IT,  pails compared to the true message of the story,  hope,  that nothing,  no darkness,  no fear,  can withstand the light of hope,  and that sometimes all it takes is the right spark,  at the right time,  one little spark that stands against the darkness as says NO it will not be extinguished,  it will not accept that the darkness is right,  it will fight back,  and in doing so fan a flame the sweeps it away,  overcoming it.
<p></p>It trully is an amazing,  beuatiful and just plain epic story,  and as much as it might seem kind of going a bit to far,  really the only way I can truly describe how it feels is with Tolkein
<p></p><em>Sam: It's like in the great stories,  Mr. Frodo... the ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger,  they were,  and sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy? (...) Those were the stories that stayed with you... that meant something,  even if you were too small to understand why. (...) Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back,  only they didn't. They kept going... because they were holding on to something!</em>
<p></p><em>Frodo: What are we holding onto,  Sam?</em>
<p></p><em>Sam: That there's some good in this world,  Mr. Frodo... and it's worth fighting for. </em>
<p></p>so in short,  YES you should at least give FOE a try.

            And we've proven over and over and over where you are twisting events,  ignoring things,  misinterpreting motivation,  and doing everything possible to make everything seem as bad and horrid as possible. All while condemning the ponies for not living up to your idea of a moral code,  that does not account for living in a hellish,  twisted post apocalyptic wasteland  where everything is trying to kill them.

            Ah,  I see.
<p></p>Still,  I think I'll stick with the version of Fallout that doesn't have characters who are already familiar with the good in the world suddenly turning into pseudo-Cold-War paranoiacs.

            <div class="quoteblock">Hey Pannic,  do you ever read fanfiction that you like? </div>
<p></p>Amazingly,  he actually liked my fic. He had some criticism of it,  but it was all good natured and overall really positive. So I guess he does.
<p></p>As for FOE,  as the othrs said,  the Mane six made mistakes,  but they were understandable,  if sometimes naive. The apocalypse was caused by a very specific combination of several mistakes. I actually see that  as an important part of the stoy. <em>Everything</em> went wrong and the smallest differenc would hav resulted in a much beter situation. But yeah,  the story is about <em>impoving</em> the situation. Not revelling in the darkness.
