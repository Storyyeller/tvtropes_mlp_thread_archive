            Speaking of The Legend of Korra is it worth seeing? Cuz ya see I love Avatar the Last Airbender but I haven't seen any episodes for Korra because I have heard bad things about it and some like it but I'm not really sure. The only things Korra related I've seen is a panel read for a couple of episodes.

            I think <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoK" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoK">Lo K</a> is starting September 13th and has been greenlit for <em>four</em> seasons so far. I don't know if their continuing the Equalist plot or if they're moving on to other things. But I do know Book two is called <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Spirits</span>.
<p></p>As far as pony goes,  it looks like we might <em>finally</em> be getting that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Celestia and Luna flashback</span> and I'm certainly looking forward to the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Power Ponies</span> episode. Though,  if there's no hint of Star Swirl this season,  I will be kinda disappointed. :P

            IMO the best Korra episodes were not as good as the best Aang episodes,  but the worst Korra episodes weren't as bad as the worst Aang episodes. But that might have something to do with not being as long anyway,  so...
<p></p>I certainly enjoyed it at least,  even if I could never get the final eoisode to play and had to just spoil myself to get closure.

<p></p>Actually,  that's a good point. It does seem quite similar.
<p></p>A heavy ammount of it influenced the book of mine closest to publication as well.
<p></p>And yeah,  the second and third seasons were generally better than the first.

<p></p>I thought it was great. The only major flaw was an overemphasis on shipping in the middle episodes. Besides,  ATLA had it's problems too (don't get me started on the ending)

            Yeah,  I can assure you that any similarities are coincidental. I've been farting around with this idea since college,  and I only ever got around to watching ATLA a few months ago. Maybe I should rewatch it and do a liveblog or something.  Probably not,  because I don't have the time.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>@Blue: I agree that the first few episodes were a bit lackluster compared to later ones,  but in retrospect I actually really like Applebuck Season.

            I usually have the same rule about watching shows that I do when reading books. I try to give them about three to five chapters/ episodes to decide whether I continue or not.
<p></p>Interestingly enough,  I was hooked on pony by the second episode because I thought NMM was actually pretty cool for a girls' show villain.

            My favourite season for Avatar the Last Airbender? Season fricking 2 . Season 2 because it had so much action in there and plus Toph is a badass! 'Nuff said. It was also where Zuko really grew as a character for me. I mean he went from a hot headed guy who wanted the approval of his dead beat father to a young man who has had many hardships in his life and that's what I liked about Zuko as the series went on he wasn't just this bad guy who wanted the Avatar for himself,  he was a character who was all about emotion and I'm sorry if I'm rambling here but god damn it,  Zuko is by far my favourite character from that show along with Sokka and Toph.

            As a Venture Brothers fan,  It's always amuses me to hear people complain about having to wait for new seasons of their favorite shows to air. Yeah,  there's a new season of V-Bros coming in the fall... of next year. After I had to wait <em>3 years</em> for the last season,  which was only half the length of any other.
<p></p>But no,  tell me more about how much it sucks having to wait almost a year between seasons. :P

<p></p>I generally thought Korra was pretty good,  my main issues with it were with the pacing,  which was understandable because they thought they only had one half season,  and the shipping.

            @Bluespade Yeah I really think they should've worried more on the plot than see how much humour they could squeeze out for season 3 which is sad because season 3 is meant to be the most important arc in the entire show and yet for the most part it was all just filler. I mean since when was Aang going to a Fire Nation school or Azula and co playing volleyball considered advancing the plot of the series? I mean sure we get more info on the world itself but was it really neccessary?
