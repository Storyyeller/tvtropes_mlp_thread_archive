            Yes but we the viewers don't have any connection to them at this point. They aren't important. They aren't who we take the moral from,  RD,  Twi,  and AJ are suppose to show us the moral. RD and AJ showed us competition brings out the worst in people. not that is true,  becuae it's not,  but that's what was shown.

            we see,  two ponies letting it get to their heads,  yes that clearly means ALL competition will do it. And really only one at that,  AJ had no issue with losing,  she just couldn't stand losing because RD,  in her mind,  cheated.

By the end,  the two of them realized they were being poor sports to each other instead of focusing on what they should have been. It was a friendly competition with a purpose,  not a personal conflict between the two. <br> <br><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_down.png" alt="[down]" title="[down]" height="16" width="16">The unanimous call on the Iron Pony Competition iss that it was terribly organized in the first place. They were both wrong about it.

            Call the bloody Ref then. Both of them were complete twats no matter how you look at it. RD is an egoist who can't play fair in competition (YELLOW CARD ON RD FOR UNSPORTSMEN LIKE CONDUCT!),  and AJ was that one guy on the soccer pitch and get pushed down then starts gunning for the dude that pushed him and ends up also getting yellow card'd for unsportsmen like conduct.
<p></p>^ yet they still act like tawts throughout the episode don't they. This is where the mandatory moral recap falls flat. They still showed the girls being all catty because RD let the competition go to her head and AJ was like "she cheating so I'll play by her rules and show her that cheating it bad" BUT YOU ARE STILL FUCKING CHEATING.

            That's kind of the point. They got so into their conflict with each other that it overtook what should have been the reason for the competition. They became jerks because all they could focus on was beating each other. AJ didn't start cheating until she knew Rainbow was cheating. She didn't want Rainbow to win unfairly like that and was blind to the fact that she was doing the same thing because of the personal conflict. <br> <br>During the closing shot where they're running together,  it shows how they <em>should</em> have approached the Running of the Leaves. They should have tried to have fun,  not beat the other.

            I saw,  still,  they made simple competition looked like it made you into an ass (pun not intentional). I'll be happier when I'm done with the I/E rated episodes,  less thing to bitch about apperantly.
