            @Chad  But they do just fine in wildness,  (unless evolved pokemns in wild are only in anime).
<p></p>Just because they want fight it's not make it OK for humans to use it.  That's way  dog or cock fight are still considered wrong and barbaric.
<p></p>Unless you suggesting that pokemons are not like animals but more like humans (in mind or spiritual sense). That's even worse.

            Good point,  I still consider it a win on her part for making Loki think he had psychologically had gotten to her. He was all like "I HAVE YOUR FEELINGS IN THE PALM OF MY HANDS!" and she's like "Lolnope! Kthnx,  cya"

            @ Death Cloud Hold on there's a story ingame I'll find for you.
<p></p>The reason why they appear in the tall grass.
<p></p>Long ago,  when Sinnoh had just been
made,  Pokémon and humans led
separate lives.
That is not to say they did not help
each other. No,  indeed they did.
They supplied each other with goods, 
and supported each other.
A Pokémon proposed to the others
to always be ready to help humans.
It asked that Pokémon be ready to
appear before humans always.
Thus,  to this day,  Pokémon appear
to us if we venture into tall grass.
