            well,  think she could get SOME,  but remember The Gala,  she thinks a six years olds birthday party is what ALL parties should be like,  so to her it was a compliment. She can't think of Gala type things as a Party.

            (I'm just going to repost this one last time. Sorry for bothering you)
<p></p><em>Fillies and Gentlecolts</em>! The Royal wedding has been a huge success<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKXlhpeb6wI">according to most<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></div></span>,  and now,  season two has been officially wrapped up. It is time for us to determine just who is <em>Best Pony Season Two</em>!
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="../wa/page-1989.html#post-49701">Here are the results of last time<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. This time,  40 Tvtropes bronies have voted,  which is a pretty major increase compared to last time's 24. Well,  what can I say,  there will always be more bronies every day,  and it seems that we've gained 16 since then. It is good to see the message of love,  tolerance and quality entertainment hasn't failed to reach out to more and more people.
<p></p>Now,  let us get to the main event: we will now announce the official ranking,  as well as <em>Best Pony Season Two</em>!
<p></p><ul><li> <strong>#6: Rainbow Dash</strong>,  with 4 votes for first,  4 x second and 3 x third,  gaining a total of 45 points. Season two hasn't been particularly good to Rainbow Dash. While everyone knows her as the local <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>,  episodes like <em>May The Best Pet Win</em> or <em>The Mysterious Mare-Do-Well</em> seemed to focus to much on the 'jerk' part. While <em>Hurricane Fluttershy</em> did a good job in redeeming her,  it was not enough to save her from the lowest rank. Relatively speaking. We hope to see her do better next time.
</li><li> <strong>#5: Pinkie Pie</strong>,  with 2 votes for first,  3 x second,  13 x third,  for a total of 58 points. Ponyville's biggest party-animal was finally allowed to show of her personality in a way that didn't involve parties in <em>Baby Cakes</em>. While people still seem reluctant to give her the top spot,  she definitely managed to win a special place in our hearts.
</li><li> <strong>#4/3: Applejack</strong>,  who was given 5 votes for first,  7 x second and 6 times third,  which adds up to 71 points. Poor Applejack never seems to be given the spotlight for herself; even on these rankings,  she now has to share the third/fourth place with some other pony for the second time in a row. She's nothing if not consistent. Her lack of obvious character flaws makes for little interesting television,  but we as a whole appear to admire her dependable personality. Applejack may not be the most entertaining pony,  but she posses a character that we should all strive for.
</li><li> <strong>#4/3: Fluttershy</strong>,  with 3 votes for first,  8 x second and 8 x third,  gaining her 71 points. Last time's runner-up will now have to be satisfied with sharing the bronze. While she is most certainly still very cute,  we got to see very few new depths to her character this season,  which might explain why her dropping in the rankings. That said,  she is still a fan-favourite,  and competition was tight. Despite her lowered ranking,  anyone that dares to say anything bad about her will still be lynched within seconds.
</li><li> <strong>#2: Rarity</strong>,  being given top spot 10 times,  second place 6 times and third place 8 times,  for a total of 98 points. Quite a few people have said something along the following lines: "X is best pony,  but Rarity gets the best episodes". <em>Sisterhoof Social</em> and <em>Sweet and Elite</em> are indeed some of the more touching stories that still managed to be funny. This,  combined with her excellent capacity for Ham even when she's not the main character,  makes her one of the most entertaining and well-rounded characters in pretty much all of animation this decade. Brava,  my lady,  brava!
</li><li> <strong>#1: Twilight Sparkle</strong>,  with a whopping 16 votes for first,  in addition to 10 votes for second and 6 for third,  winning <em>Best pony</em> once again by a landslide with 138 points. Was there ever any doubt? Twilight Sparkle,  the nerdy yet lovable prodigy,  is someone that tropers such as ourselves can identify with. Despite her bookish nature,  she showed a capacity for some crazy as well,  which made her all the more endearing. There is no doubt about it. Tvtropes has spoken: Twilight Sparkle is <em>Best Pony Season Two</em>.
</li></ul><p></p>So what do we do now? Well,  we bide our time,  I suppose. The next season won't be here fopr a long time,  but bronies will still be bronies. There will be fanart,  fanfiction,  conventions and whatever else. The internet is a great place,  and ponies made it even better. We eagerly await season three.
<p></p>Have a good hiatus. Bronies forever!

            Hello there? Mind if I drop in to talk about the finale Two-Parter?
<p></p>So I rewatched the Finale and I must say,  my opinion of it was rather mixed. While all of the good stuff was there,  I did feel that the plot was clunky and rushed. Most of it was the rather poor execution of Shining Armor and Princess Candence.
<p></p>Right from the get-go we are told that <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">not only is Shining Armor is Twilight's Big Brother,  he was her closest friend as a foal</a>. This was given NO foreshadowing whatsoever in the previous episodes. Granted,  I don't think the writers were thinking this far ahead when "Cutie Mark Chronicles" was written,  but there shouldhave been SOME foreshadowing in some of the season two episodes. Candence doesn't fare any better as she was Twilight's foalsitter and the two seemed to share a close bond with eachother in the flashbacks. It's really feels like someone took the concept of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneHigh" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneHigh">Clone!Ponce de Leon</a> and played it seriously sans the dying part.
<p></p>Another problem I had was that the other members of the Mane Six were pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> during the two parter. I know where they wanted to keep the Drama,  but the way they handled the others in this episode(s) was really sketchy. And at some places,  they felt OOC. I think the example of this that hit me the most was Applejack's rather non-chalant reaction to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Changling!Candence</span> scoffing her hous de vours. Applejack has always been a proud pony,  she shows visible vermhent when Prince Blueblood scoffs her apple treats in "Best Night Ever" and vows to outdo the fancy alternatives. Here,  she seems to take it with uncharacteristic stride,  and this is <em>considering</em> that she was the royal caterer.
<p></p>I had a few problems with the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Canterlot Mines</span> escape,  but I can't fault it for that from a storytelling perspective because that kind of escapeis rather prelevant in media. I know it's a nitpick,  but it still irks me that the good royals are <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsBetterWithPrincesses" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsBetterWithPrincesses">princesses</a> while the focus bad guy is a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">queen</a>,  but again. That's more of a media problem than anything else.
<p></p>Again,  I can see the makings of a real good movie in this. The plot was interesting enough to keep me engaged. Although rather poorly presented,  both Shining Armor and Candence were nice characters and I adored the Changling Queen. It's something about that Malificent esque design that really makes her stand out.
<p></p>I could see this as a really good <em>movie</em>. Probably as good as Disney's classical Princess tales,  it really was handicapped by the dreaded 30-minute airtime slot. Candence's Lament was really good.

            @Pipping Fool: That's pretty much how i felt about the finale as well. I mean,  we know coming in that there were going to be these two new characters,  but I honestly did not expect them to fully eclipse our protagonist like what happened. Pretty much every problem I had with the finale can be traced to the fact that the story was about to characters whom we have never scene before and whom we will probably never see again.

            @ Pipping,  I thought did really well bringing them in (at least if Cadance was a unicorn,  through in a new Alicorn wihtout explain WTF Alicorns are/where they come from/etc...) But even that,  we already know enough about Equestria to know that we don't know everything,  not every little detail is shown,  we can just accept that it makes sense since we haven't seen anything to the contrary.
<p></p>Anyway,  ok might have been nice to get something about Twi's brother earlier,  but you really can't expect something about Cadance,  Yes from a media/narrative/expected story format POV yes,  but the show always go more realistic then just whats expected. And how many people ever talk to there friends or make a big deal about there favorite baby-sitter? (really it reminds me of the story a month or so ago about a teenager that just realized Lauren Faust was her babysitter) And the song pretty much perfectly explains why we've never heard of SA,  Twi and him have drifted apart since she's come to ponyville,  and it's just now,  when she's actually thinking about how close they were she realizes just how much she missed him.
<p></p>So again,  yes it would have beneifited greatly from more air time,  but you have to show some lenanicy about stuff like that,  it will never be 100% perfect,  but the DHX/Studio B guys do the damn best to make it as great as they can and it shows.

<p></p>Oh,  come on. It was a pretty good episode,  despite some glaring flaws. Besides,  we are pretty darn outnumbered here.
<p></p>People can enjoy it if they want,  but it's not like the show is above criticism. Besides,  what good would this thread be if everyone agreed? Heck,  why not try argue with us?

            And honestly,  I didn't have a problem with the focus on Cadance and SA at all,  because at least I didn't find them boring like I was dreading. I mentioned early on that the quality of this ep was most likely going to hinge on the likability of the two new characters.
<p></p>Y'know what? I thought they were pretty gosh darned likable myself

            Aww,  shucks y'all. Thanks for the pleasant introduction~
<p></p>Again,  I liked Candence and SA. I liked their characters,  it's just that Twilight seemed to have a strong connection with the both of them and it feels really out of place that they haven't been foreshadowed earlier.
<p></p>(Another thing I forgot to address,  SA is the Captain of the Freakin' Royal Gaurd! There was no possible way that he couldn't be foreshadowed or relatively unknown in Equestrian! I think that made me more confused than him and Twilight being Best Friends/Siblings)
