            ^To be fair,  that wasn't the moral they wanted to portray in that episode.  They could easily have gone with that,  A) making Gilda more sympathetic and B) letting Pinkie learn a lesson early on in the season,  but I guess that was a little ambiguous for so early in the show's run.

            For GTBO,  I feel that episode was more about Dash learning a lesson.  She didn't want to know Pimkie in the beginning,  but she thought she knew Gilda.

            I have to admit that the fact Pinkie didn't learn the lesson in that episode is one of the things that first sold me on the series having good writing.  The first time I saw that episode,  I was almost entirely sure that it was going to be a "Pinkie will learn that Gilda isn't really all that bad" moral,  and the fact that they subverted that was a pleasant surprise.  It isn't often you get a kids' show that actually admits that some people are going to be jerks no matter how nice you are to them.

<p></p>It makes sense in the context of the episode,  but the fact that the ep was made like that at all is...

            Pinkie: I just don't get it! How can Cranky Doodle not like me!? I mean hello! This is me we're talking about! Everypony in Ponyville loves me! I throw the best parties anywhere,  I'm good at making people laugh,  I'm always really happy so that even if the other person isn't happy I can be happy enough for both of us. I mean I'm just so full of joy and laughing and happy and-
<p></p>Twilight: Pinkie! Did you ever think that maybe that's the problem?
<p></p>Pinkie: Huh?
<p></p>Twilight: You're always happy,  and loud,  and you never stop talking.
<p></p>Pinkie: Well duh. Who wouldn't want to be happy all the time? And parties are the happiest thing I know of so as long as I'm having one I know I can make people happy! Besides if I were to stop talking that would be boring and nopony likes being bored! I mean it's so,  boring!
<p></p>Twilight: Pinkie,  just because you like having parties all the time doesn't mean that everyone else does. Some ponies like it better when things are quiet and people leave them alone.
<p></p>Pinkie: Yeah right! What kind of person wants to be stuck all by themselves??
<p></p>Twiligh: Well,  I do.
<p></p>Pinkie: What? But Twilight,  you LOVE my parties!
<p></p>Twilight: Yes I do. But I can't spend every day having a different party. No pony could. (Well,  no pony except you.) Sometimes I just like to stay at home and read a book by myself.
<p></p>Pinkie: So you're saying... I should throw Cranky Doodle a party,  where no one is invited?
<p></p>Twilight: I'm saying you should just let Cranky be himself and not force him to do something he doesn't like. If he doesn't want to go to a party you shouldn't pressure him to. If he doesn't like talking a lot maybe you should stop talking so much.
<p></p>Pinkie: And then you think he'll like me?
<p></p>Twilight: Then I think he'll TOLERATE you. Once he stops running away from you maybe then you can work on making him your friend.

            Hopefully that happens.  Goodness knows I'll sympathize with Cranky if that's the case.  One of the most annoying things about college was that every freaking night somebody tried to drag me out someplace when I just wanted to chill in my room and read something.

<p></p>I still don't think this is the episode with "Smile,  Smile,  Smile".  It just... doesn't feel right.  I admit it probably will be this episode,  but... I dunno.

            @Red I think Pinkie will sing the song to Cranky after she's learned her lesson. She's explaining to him the meaning behind all the insane stuff that she does. Her life's philosophy.
<p></p>The song sounds pretty heartfelt

            You know I haven't actually seen Smile Smile Smile. It might shed some light on Cranky's specific problem with Pinkie,  I kind of just had to guess. Course if I'd have done it with another pair,  say Pinkie and AJ,  I'd have taken that in a different direction. Between Last Round up and Hearthswarming Eve (I know they were acting) it seems AJ has a history of getting agitated wth Pinkie.
