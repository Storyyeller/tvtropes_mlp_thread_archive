            She had to apply the lesson to <em>retain</em> that friendship,  though. I'm sure that if she had continued to pester them against their wishes,  she wouldn't have been Cranky <em>or</em> Matilda's friend anymore.

            I don't like <em>any</em> of Pinkie-centric episodes. Then again,  I don't like a lot of episodes.
<p></p>One of very few I loved was a Rarity episode. It says a lot about how much I like her. Oddly enough,  although Twilight is my favorite pony,  I don't like episodes featuring her either.

            Pinkie tends to become <em>much</em> more three dimentional as the focus character since it allows her to gain pathos from actually becoming involved in a dilemma rather than starting one for comic relief.
<p></p>It's sort of the opposite reason AJ and Twilight become more vibrant as main characters,  while the latter gain pathos from having their rare buffoonish qualities spotlighted,  Pinkie gets them from her rare more poignant ones (though recently I think Twilight has mastered the art of bringing personality out of even minor roles,  eg. Spike At Your Service).

            <div class="quoteblock">I'm with badwolf on this one. Pinkie had her moments,  but on the whole I found her more aggravating than anything else. And as I've said before,  I'm fine with her having flaws; my issue with that episode is that I never felt like she actually understood the lesson because she got what she wanted without ever actually giving Cranky his space.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I agree that the lesson was great,  but I didn't at all get the feeling that Pinkie ever demonstrated that she learned it because she never actually left Cranky alone until after he agreed to be her friend. I thought it had a great message,  but kinda shot itself in the foot because in function Pinkie didn't actually do it. If the episode had ended with Pinkie leaving him alone,  and him giving her a second chance because of it,  it would probably be one of my favorite episodes. </div>

            Pinkie in general is the pony almost always with her personality in full swing in <em>everything</em> she does,  she's rarely reduced to a generic background pony,  it's just as a supporting character she is usually one note comic relief and only gains a lot of pathos from being the lead.
<p></p>I've noticed she's been the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt Monkey</a> a fair few times in Season Three though,  an attempt to remedy this perhaps.

            Admittedly,  Pinkie leaving Cranky alone would have given the writers more time to set up the Matilda reveal. And imagine how funny it would be to see Pinkie struggling NOT to bother him.
