            To be fair,  if he was enough to call Celestia and Luna's attentions,  he was probably <em>very</em> good at what he did. You saw the inside of his castle. Imagine that ingenuity applied to civic planning!
<p></p>Mayor Stallion still has my vote,  though. A vote for Mayor Stallion is a vote for the future.

What,  did you guys get rid of absentee voting while I wasn't paying attention? Is this how the mayor treats her citizens? It's obvious how much needs to be changed around here... er,  there.
