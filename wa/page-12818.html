            I liked the song well enough,  even though I've already sort of forgotten it. But it was entertaining enough.

            Wonder if we'll ever see the Manehattan branch of the CMC.  Babs at least needs to find some excuses to pop up every now and then.
<p></p>We didn't actually see who Bab's parents were,  did we?  I was wondering if it was the Oranges,  but they didn't show up at the reunion,  so I guess not.

<p></p>But yeah,  it was cool to see Babs again,  and I think that they did pretty well with AJ's character.  It's kinda like her to promise that it'll be awesome and then get too caught up in trying to follow up on that she wouldn't realize she messed it up.
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Also,  I <em>love</em> the fact that the show went with "it's not important what you do,  it's who you do it with",  because it completely confirms like an entire arc in the fanfic I'm writing. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue"> </span>

            This whole episode could've been avoided if they had just made the reunion like a week or something.  I get that they're all busy ponies but my impression is that they put family ahead of everything and I'm sure they wouldn't mind.  Again,  drawing on experiences of my own extended family but still.

            Yeah...
<p></p>Well,  as far as episodes go that certainly wasn't a bad one. It sadly wasn't quite as memorable as all that,  though. I kinda feel like I wanted AJ to be more... more,  or something. Like,  I don't want to say she felt exactly flat,  but this was really just the same conflict as we've seen in all her other focus episodes: AJ really wants something. She goes overboard/fails. It falls apart,  and she gets sad,  and somepony else has to pull her out of it because friendship/family.
<p></p>All of the other girls have had such a wide variety of desires,  even in their supporting roles. Where's the episode about AJ not feeling like working? OR about having to deal with the fact that <em>she's</em> too injured/tired to work for once? Where's the episode about AJ resenting the fact that she's the most dependable pony,  and therefore can never depend on anypony as much as they do on her?
<p></p>I guess it's because she's had so few focus episodes,  that she still feels very first-season compared to the other's,  but I just kinda can't help but be disappointed. It was still an okay episode,  but I can't deny I was hoping for something more. At the very least,  a song that was actually about something other than what she was physically doing at that exact moment.
<p></p>@Crow: Well,  when Babs arrived and left there was nopony with her,  so it's still possible that she just had to go alone because her parents were busy.

            No,  the problem is that Applejack got caught up in the activity planning and missed the point of having a reunion in the first place.
<p></p>It's not about the doing stuff,  but who you're doing it with.

            @Ace: My headcanon is that if her parent <em>are</em> dead,  she's already come to terms with it due to the support of the rest of her family.  Sure she's sad sometimes,  but it would take more than that to break her down.
<p></p>@Kegisak: Yeah,  I can see what you mean.  Taken on it's own there's nothing particularly wrong with it,  but it is quite similar to her other focus episodes.

            I kind of wish that there hadn't been a plot at all,  really,  just a feel-good episode of us getting introduced to the Apple Family,  going around and talking to people (like Braeburn T_T) and just stuff like that.

            I did find it strange that everypony showed up the morning of the reunion and seemed to leave that night.  What,  no one crashed at the Apple place for a few nights?  Even though it's probably a long trip for some of them?

            Good points,  I can see where you're coming from.  I get the feeling that no one really knows what to do with Applejack since she pretty much has her purpose in life and she's pretty comfortable with it,  so it can seem like there's nowhere else to go.

            Maybe the way to develop Applejack then is to show her forging new bonds with other characters?
