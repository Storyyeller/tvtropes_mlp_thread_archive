<p></p>"They called them 'hands',  Miss Heartstrings." replied the zoology teacher. "Apparrently these 'who-mans' used them much in the same way we use our hooves. Much more complex,  though. They had something they called 'fingers' allowing for greater manual dexterity."

            I think she'd know what hands are; there are other species in Equestria that have them after all.  Dragons,  Minotaurs,  and Ahuizotl is a major character in a popular book series. I'd assume your average pony know of them.

            Wi just take my headcanon cues from what the show has provided:  Lyra is energetic,  silly,  and perhaps feels too much (seriously,  who cries at a bug eating their sandwich?). I like the human thing as a fan joke and one of her various hobbies,  though I prefer to maintain she's a musician or some sort of bard.

            My current fanfic project stars Lyra and has a music focus. The lyre is an instrument invented by griffins,  and Lyra spent much of her childhood apprenticed to a griffin musician. Unfortunately,  it's slow going,  as I think I've re-written the opening thousand words at least three times now. I'll get there eventually.

<p></p>Interesting observation. Some people wanted An Earth Pony's Guide to Magic (my firt ponyfic) to be of the first kind of moral when it was always meant to be of the second kind. Those that accepted the type of story it was meant to be liked the ending though.

<p></p>Like I said,  if it was just minor premium content on the side or something that'd be one thing — and from what I understand,  for most of the game it is.  The problem is extorting you out of nowhere on the very ending scene for about $50.
<p></p>For a hair more than that combined price,  I bought on Steam:
<p></p><ul><li>Recettear
</li><li>Fortune Summoners
</li><li>Chantelise
</li><li>Portal 1 &amp; 2
</li><li>Tomb Raider: Anniversary
</li><li>Tomb Raider: Legend
</li><li>Tomb Raider: Underworld
</li><li>All three seasons of Telltale Sam &amp; Max — 16 decent-length point-n-clicks
</li><li>Rainslick Precipice 1-3
</li><li>Breath of Death
</li><li>Cthulhu Saves the World
</li></ul><p></p>That's about 138 hours' play time so far,  and I haven't even touched half of them yet.  Some of them are AAA titles.

<p></p>You know,  I don't approve of hacking the game to get around paid functions,  even if they are extortionate...but...they did the price list in an <strong>exposed client-side XML???</strong>

<p></p>It gets better. It's not just the price list that's exposed XML. It's <em>the entire game outside of the art assets.</em> Turns out that the engine itself is just a simple XML parser running on a loop,  and the XML itself comprises the majority of the game's source code. People are already beginning to mod the shit out of it. Depending on how much they can do with it,  they may even be able to create a whole game from scratch using the same assets.
<p></p>I have to hand it to Gameloft. Aside from it being stupidly insecure,  that's a really neat way to ensure cross-platform compatibility with a single code base.
