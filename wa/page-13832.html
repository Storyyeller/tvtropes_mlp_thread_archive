<p></p><div class="quoteblock"><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Holy horse manure!!! <br>A "Purple Rain",  "The Princess Bride",  and "The Twilight Zone" references,  Cadance spelled Cad<em>a</em>nce,  And Twilight confirmed to having opulent quarters in Canterlot,  but choosing to remain in Ponyville with her friends,  all in the FIRST SIX PAGES!!!</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alicorn is defined in the book as "a special breed" that is "able to harness the magical powers of the Unicorns,  the flight abilities of the Pegasi,  and <em>the strength of a good,  true heart of an Earth Pony</em>." Nice confirmation on the way the nature of alicorns reflects all three pony breeds.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Derpy gets an early cameo... Sadly,  the Cakes are out of muffins... THE HORROR!!! ◵◠◷</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Twilight refers to Cadance as her "Pegasister-in-law" when deciding to head north and visit her.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">San Fransiscolt. That is all! XD</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You don't have to be a Unicorn to become an Alicorn. <br>I repeat... You DO NOT need to be a Unicorn to ascend to Alicornhood! <br>Cadance was an <em>orphaned pegasus</em>,  found in the forest and taken in by an Earth Pony village. <br>The book's writer was obviously <em>privy to official canon information</em>... <br>Cadance used her special talents for love and compassion to reform a new villain. The villains necklace amplified both their powers. The book specifically refers to Cadance being <em>surrounded by magical energy and taken to a "Strange Place" where she met Celestia and became a princess</em>. Celestia "adopts" her as her niece,  and brings her to Canterlot. <br>Remember,  this was written before Magical Mystery Cure was released!</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cadance defines her own destiny to "lead other ponies with my strengths of <em>True Love and Tolerance</em>." Yes,  it's capitalized.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cadance also refers to Twilight: "Of course,  <em>my dear new sister</em>",  seemingly carrying the idea of alicorns adopting each other as family.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">LOLOLOL! Pinkie's Party Time watch is referenced on multiple occasions! What time is it? It's time to PARTY!!!</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gilda AND Trixie leading on and influencing a necklace corrupted Twilight! <em>errmergherd,  wat</em>!</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dear God!!! There's book fort reference!!! XD</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Interestingly,  The writer is privy to the "Strange Place" where Cadance meets Celestia and becomes and Alicorn,  but states that the last time all the Mane 6 visited the Crystal Empire was when they held the Crystal Faire and searched for the Crystal Heart to resist King Sombra. This lends credence to the author being specifically made privy to the Alicorn ascension story,  and that this was known before the Equestria Games were revealed. It has been said Magical Mystery Cure was written in November of 2011.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The <em>big special moral</em> at the end of the story... "Now I know that a princess is not defined by the things she chooses for her kingdom. All that matters is how she treats other ponies,  especially her friends. Princess or not - we are all equal ponies!"</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Let that shoot down the "Twilight is above her friends" arguments. This book's writer was clearly given access to inside knowledge to write this book. the fact that it both opens with Twilight choosing her friends in Ponyville over the opulent castle,  and her declaring herself an equal to her friends at the end,  pretty much shoots those arguments right out of the party canon. :P</span></div>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Don't take the Trixie parts too seriously,  while she would be loathe to admit it,  her part is rather minor (GASP).</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This book is clearly written before knowledge of Magic Duel or Games Ponies Play,  but given the accuracy of Cadance's ascension,  the author was specifically given prior knowledge of The ascension process from Magical Mystery Cure. In general,  the book is a one off,  but the author was <em>clearly</em> fed knowledge about alicorns that's too specific to be a coincidence. That,  and it's appearance just after the season finale,  suggests that this was intentionally released as a compliment to the finale.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As for Trixie... She does team up with Gilda to put on a show in the Crystal Empire. She's still telling her "stories" again... Meaning she's being a show mare. Go figure,  Twi's friends break it up. Gilda basically tells Twilight that "If she were a princess,  she'd do what <em>she</em> wants,  and not listen to anyone else". Due to certain elements in the story,  this messes Twi up. Gilda mostly acts as the antagonist. Trixie is more in there to be Trixie.</span></div>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's obvious that this book was written before Magic Duel or Games Ponies Play,  as it misses details pertaining to both of those episodes (namely Trixie's reformation,  and the second visit to the Crystal Empire by the Mane 6). Given the uncanny similarity of Cadance's ascension to Twilight's ascension in Magical Mystery Cure though,  the author had to have been given prior knowledge of the ascension process from Hasbro. The knowledge this author has about alicorns is far too specific and detailed to be a coincidence. That,  and it's appearance just after the season finale,  suggests that this was intentionally released as a compliment to the finale,  and that Hasbro gave the author detailed advance knowledge of alicorns and their ascension process,  to allow this book to be planted as a compliment to the finale.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Actually,  there is even the possibility that the author had limited knowledge of Magic Duel. There IS a necklace that is involved in Cadance becoming an Alicorn,  but it does not fit the description of the Alicorn Amulet. If there was limited knowledge there,  it's entirely possible that the author wrote around "a necklace that can amplify the wearer's power" but filled in some planks themselves. This detail is not known.</span></div>

            I interpret it as referring to inner strength. Strength of the mind and soul,  resistance to corruption,  that kind of thing. Their magical energies are focused inward,  rather than outward,  which could easily apply to Kegi's "amp" theory,  as well as their strength and endurance.

<p></p>RE: novel spoilers,  it's a little silly the guy is harping on how X IS CANON and AUTHOR TOTALLY HAD ACCESS TO OFFICIAL CANON FOR Y,  but the author didn't know about two rather critical episodes that kind of flub the whole thing.
<p></p>I'm not really annoyed about that kind of continuity fudge.  It happens all the time in multimedia franchises,  is unavoidable to an extent,  and frankly we can get richer stories that way.  Just saying fans might want to make sure their canon's loaded before calling shots that loudly. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            @Pykrete By "flub the whole thing",  you mean neglect two tiny details that don't affect how the story turns out in the slightest,  right? Definitely not a big deal,  and certainly not enough to discount how "canon" the book is.
