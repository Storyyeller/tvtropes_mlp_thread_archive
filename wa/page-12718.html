            'contrasting' isn't the same as 'clashing'. Oftentimes a bit of contrast is actually very good for a colour scheme. The presence of opposites can be quite compelling.

            Thank you to whoever mentioned the Rainbow Dash earphones at Hot Topic,  because today I was able to find that store when I was on a day trip (there's not one in my home town anymore,  but there was one in a town not too far away) and I found not only the headphones (which are the full cupped kind that I like,  not the earbuds) but also two t-shirts I liked (one with Luna and the other has a bunch of the characters on it) and two trading card packages.  My parents and I decided to save the things other than the headphones for Christmas,  but not the headphones because I wanted to make sure that they worked in case any returns or replacements had to be made so they're going to be my new main headphones now.
<p></p>@Applelight: Is Batty someone who would be friends with Luna,  or is his story one that doesn't interact much with the canon characters?  Your description of him sounds kind of like the ponies that carried Luna's carriage in Luna Eclipsed.  Or is that what you based him off of anyway?

<p></p>Yes,  he's a Nocturnus,  like Luna's guards.  And I was always sorely tempted to write a connection between him and Luna.  Not sure how to do it though.

            I actually developed a good bit of backstory for Trottingham for a fic I'm writing. Like Kegi,  I place it across the sea as an England analog,  but it's just a city,  not a country.
<p></p>When Nightmare Moon refused to allow the sun to rise,  it was not an open and shut affair,  and the night lasted for many months before she was defeated. Fearing that the sun may never rise again,  a group of enterprising ponies set off across the sea to the east to find the sun themselves. Eventually,  the did find it,  and settled on the western coast of the continent they had come across where the sun was frozen in a perpetual dawn. Thus they founded Trottingham,  The City on the Edge of Tomorrow. Eventually,  the sun and moon began to move again,  but the city remained and flourished,  and was peacefully annexed by the Griffin Empire as it expanded across the continent.
<p></p>The culture of the city is one of advancement and cooperation,  due to the unique mix of races inhabiting it,  with magic and technology being developed and used for the purposes of accommodation and adaptation to citizens of any race that chooses to visit or take up residence there.

            Thinking about Luna's role in Sleepless in Ponyville,  I realized that she was being a therapist,  of sorts.  Especially in the way that she didn't just reassure Scootaloo and make the monsters just go away,  she talked Scootaloo through her fears and helped her realize that she had a deeper,  more unstated fear of rejection that was stronger than the fear of the monsters from the stories.
<p></p>Now I'm imagining Luna trying to be a therapist to ponies outside of their dreams as well.  Not sure if that would work,  though.  Her sterner approach might work for some,  like Scootaloo,  but she might end up accidentally intimidating more timid ponies.
<p></p>I really do like seeing her in a role of helping ponies work through their fears,  which is a nice reversal of her earlier roles,  first where she was Nightmare Moon and then when she was accidentally scaring the ponies in Luna Eclipsed.

            @Ace: You're right about the g-forces. Having weak hooves makes landing harder. Basically,  if you cant handle of your own weight when you land,  your legs will buckle.

            @Hero Shepherd: Speaking of Dreamwalker Luna,  I thought of something about her Nightmare Moon persona.  If she was known by that name because she caused nightmares,  what if she at least first started causing nightmares out of a desire to force ponies to stay awake at night?
<p></p>@Gex: Thanks!  I really have to thank whoever posted a mention of the headphones on this forum,  because then I wouldn't have known they existed.
