            Fluttershy struck me as an outcast.  She was born a pegasus,  but was bad at flying,  and she found herself more comfortable on Earth?  She must've been an odd one.  I know pegasi and unicorns can interact and inhabit the same environments as the Earth Ponies,  but it's something to think about.

            I'm just curious to see how Fluttershy's parents would react to their daughter's choice in lifestyle. While Pegasi don't NEED a career based around flying,  it definitely seems to be encouraged,  and since her parents were the ones who must have sent her to flight school in the first place,  I reckon they wanted her to become a great flyer.

            but all pegasi (including her) can fly competently without instruction. Flight school seems to be a place you go if you want to be an athlete. Fluttershy clearly didn't want to be there,  hinting that maybe she was being encouraged by her parents

<p></p>Fluttershy could fly just fine even as a Filly (look at So Many Wonders) Flight school seems to be a place where you practice in Competitive flying.
<p></p>Everyone goes on about Fluttershy acting a lot like an Earth pony,  when really,  she does fly around an awful lot. She prefers the ground,  but it's not like she's incompetent in the air

Of course not; I don't think I've ever heard of anyone denying credit to the rest of the cast and crew who worked on the show.
<p></p>But again,  at the end of the day,  it's the creator who gets the whole thing started,  the one who gets the core <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roXJuJfbdG4">idea<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that everyone else coalesces around.  To say that Ms. Faust should be put in the limelight because she was outnumbered by her team is even more egregious IMO.

<p></p>From what you're saying,  an earth pony with Fluttershy's cutie mark would be even better at it than her.
<p></p>Don't start saying that anyone can use Earth Pony magic,  that's like saying anyone can use Unicorn magic if they try hard enough.

            Don't forget she has "an uncanny ability" to communicate with animals "on their level".  The way it was worded made me believe talking with animals is a rare power,  which is another bit of evidence why Fluttershy is special.  This is something that could very well have impressed her parents,  but then,  it sounds a bit mundane.
<p></p>—&gt;<strong>Fluttershy:</strong> I have the ability to talk to animals!  Can I stay on Earth?  Please?
—&gt;<strong>Fluttermom:</strong> That's nice Dear.  What are you eating these days?
<p></p>Maybe we'll see an episode where she'll be convinced she wants to become an Earth Pony!  That could <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">lead to some serious drama however</a>,  and I don't see anything like that happening until Season 3 or so,  when Hasbro has more faith in letting the show do what it wants to do.

            I orginally thought that Earth Ponies got the raw end of the deal when it comes to magic and badassery.  They can't fly,  walk on clouds or control weather like a Pegasus,  or cast spells like a Unicorn.  But the more I think about it,  maybe Earth Ponies really do have passive magic and arn't <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">muggles</a> in the strictest sense of the word.
<p></p>Look at the ponies of Appleoosa.  They grew a full sized apple orchard in less than a year,  in the middle of a freaking desert.  There has got to be some magic involved in a feat like that.
<p></p>And when it comes to badassery,  the Appleoosians can fight Buffalo in hoof to hoof combat,  and it takes only four Earth Ponies to pull a huge train at speed for hours on end.  I think a Pegasus would be hard pressed to match that.
<p></p>And as for AJ and Pinkie?  AJ can stop a stampede single hoofedly,  control a rope with her tail (I haven't seen any other pony use their tail like a limb) and was able to take both herself and Fluttershy halfway up a mountain with plenty of energy to spare.  Plus she can pull loads of applecarts at once.
<p></p>Pinkie Pie?  What more can you say?  She makes the laws of physics her bitch!
<p></p>What I'd really love to see is Big Mac getting an ep focusing on him,  showing his strength and determination.  They could make him <em>ridicously</em> strong and tough,  just to show that Earth Ponies are not to be underestimited.  Prehaps he has to beat the crap out of something in order to rescue the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs">CM Cs</a>?

            Re: The Fluttershy thing: Just because her parents sent her to flight school doesn't they ever expected her to be a Rainbow Dash caliber flyer; maybe they just noticed that she wasn't good at flying and figured that sending her to a flight school would make her more confident or something.  I mean,  I'm a terrible athlete,  but it didn't stop my parents from signing me up for a soccer camp thing once.
<p></p>I don't think the Flying = walking parallel is quite accurate either; Pegasi might be able to learn to fly on their own,  but it's not like walking.  Scootaloo is probably about the same age that RD was in the flashback,  and at best she can kinda hover a little.
