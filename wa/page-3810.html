            As red said,  the first four books are available in print. Well they will be once the Kickstarter drive ends,  holy fuck did that go off,  guy started with a goal of ~60K to reprint one book,  and now has over 700K and no idea what to do with it since very single piece of physical OOTS merchandise now has enough money to have a double order of it made and still has a week left on the drive.
<p></p>but just putting it out there since we know how much you love good villians and the Stick ones are some of the best.
<p></p>and it's only 835 pages ATM

            About that mirror that makes baby pony clones,  I don't think I'd like that idea to be used again,  unless the babies had distinct personalities from their parents.  One of my major Pet Peeve Tropes is when the kids have identical personalities to their parents (I'm not sure if that's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">Generation Xerox</a> or if that's just about their lives being the same or parallel).
<p></p>I wouldn't mind the ponies having to deal with literal clones/duplicates,  though,  especially if it would be like the one where Calvin from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CalvinAndHobbes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CalvinAndHobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a> duplicated himself and then was confronted with the fact that his duplicates also shared his flaws (which led him to make a purely good duplicate of himself in a later series of strips).

            @Ace: If there was clone divergence with the clone babies,  then that wouldn't bother me as much.  Especially if it showed that even if they had similar personalities,  their life experiences would be different because they're different people (ponies?),  so they would end up having some differences from that alone.
<p></p>Luckily,  I don't think all the baby mirror clones in the original G1 series even HAD identical personalities to their parents,  most notably Baby Shady,  who didn't share her mother's self-esteem issues.

            @Ginger: What if you printed it out yourself?  And then got it bound into a book format?  Or does it have to be formally published by someone else to count?
