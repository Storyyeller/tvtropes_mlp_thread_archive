            I had a dream that gave me an idea for a fic. a Changeling living in canterlot as a pony who is an author who write a series of books about a changeling living in canterlot as a pony.
<p></p>I've had ideas for things like this before. this is gonna keep bouncing around my head until I have the beginnings of a fic for it. But I'll never actually do anything with it.

            I hardly ever remember my dreams these days. Possibly for the best,  seeing how nightmare-filled my dreams used to be. I think my lack of rememberring my dreams actually started when I moved out. I was afraid of what I would dream after that and so slept as little as possible so I was always too tired to remember my dreams. Worked very well. I barely ever remember a dream since then.

            Alright,  let's get watching.  I've heard suggestions to watch 'Games Ponies Play' first,  then 'Just for Sidekicks',  so I'll do that.
<p></p>Okay,  so yeah,  it's pretty obvious that Peachbottom isn't the inspector... she still seems pretty nice,  though.
<p></p>Twilight,  dear,  stop reading off the script.
<p></p>"Imagine her mane turned into a porcupine."  Rarity is holding up fairly well under this stress,  too.

            Yeah,  the whole "squeaking down a window" gag is one of those glorious comedy tropes that just gets funnier the longer it is. The fact that you get to watch Rarity's reaction to the sound through the whole thing turns it into comedy gold.

            I quite disliked the latest episode. Some of the gags were not bad,  but still,  the plot was very uninteresting and the ending made no sense whatsoever.
<p></p>I mean,  the representative just learned that <em>the welcoming committee designated by the Crystal Empire is disorganized enough to mistake her for another pony,  for a whole day</em>; and she <em>still decides to grant the Crystal Empire the games?</em>?
<p></p>That makes no sense. If the Crystal Empire is so little confident in its own capabilities to hire some non-locals in order to show her around,  and if these locals mess up to that degree,  then the Crystal Empire is clearly in no position to be able to host the Equestrian Games. Pity for Rainbow Dash and for the Crystal Empire foals,  sure; but after all,  if the games are granted to the Crystal Empire the fans of all other cities will be just as disappointed.

<p></p>You know,  that is a good point. I don't really see why exactly they had to call M6 to begin with.

            The main reason that the inspector chose the Empire (which was poorly elaborated on,  yeah) was that everywhere else she goes,  she was buttered up and nothing she saw was genuine. It could have been presented much better,  but the reasoning's there.

            Well,  I guess that the M6 are big celebrities in Equestria by now,  what with them having saved the world a number of times and with Twilight being the personal student of Princess Celestia. So I can see why Cadence would have liked them to support the Crystal Empire candidacy. Still,  to have them as the main and only guides of the inspector does not really speak well about Cadence's confidence in the abilities of her subjects.

I guess that being buttered up could be annoying; but still,  the Empire showed a blatant lack of organization. That's the sort of thing that an inspector would not look favourably to,  I think.
