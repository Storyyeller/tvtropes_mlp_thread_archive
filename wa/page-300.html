            You don't understand.  I CANNOT make mistakes.  I have no,  as you humans would say,  margin for error.
<p></p>Unicorn magic is an extention of the will.  It is a manifestation of a pony's thoughts and feelings.  That night,  the only thing I could think of was the love my sister recieved,  and how much I wanted it.  By the time Celly reached me,  those feelings were warped and twisted into the persona of Nightmare Moon.
<p></p>Our battle over Equestria nearly caused armageddon.
<p></p>And I remember every minute of it.
<p></p>I saw everypony killed in our conflict,  every house destroyed,  every village wiped from existance.
<p></p>You humans would have diagnosed me as having Multiple Personality Disorder.  But it was much more than that.  Nightmare Moon was a being unto her own,  who had taken me over both body and spirit,  locking me in a corner of my own mind.  I could only bear witness to the atrocities she committed.
<p></p>When Celly used the Elements,  she could not unlock their full potential.  She could bring the five together,  but she could not unlock the sixth.  As a result,  she could not save me from what I had created.
<p></p>In my last moments on Equestria,  I was begging Celly to save me.  To free me from this prison I had created.  But she could only say two words.
<p></p>"I'm Sorry"

            Exactly.  It's time for you to move on,  Luna.  If you keep dwelling on the past,  you won't have a future.  And if you don't have a future,  then I dare say Equestria won't have much of one either.  So keep your chin up,  Luna.  Have a brave heart.

            That was so long ago Luna,  and you spent 1000 years on the moon because of it.  You suffered more than anypony else,  and I don't think there's anypony who hasn't forgiven you already.  I'm sure Celestia would say the same,  and if we hadn't scared Twilight away forever she would agree as well.

            Anemoi,  I shall look that up.
<p></p>Luna,  I forgive you. That wasn't you,  Princess Luna,  that did those horrible things. That was Nightmare Moon.
<p></p>My human friend on here,  STK,  has had to deal with all sorts of things. He even has a friend Aly who has a friend Ezra who has 10 split personalities. One of those personalities did something horrible to her. He told her he had cancer and got her worried for two days straight. It was a terrible experience,  from what he's told me.

<p></p>Yes,  Pinkie.  Let's paint the town!  Not literally,  some business owners might not like that...
