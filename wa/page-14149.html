            Sharing "How I went insane -AKA How I became a brony" stories,  eh?
<p></p>My first exposure to G4 Ponies was actually a <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfWarcraft" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> guildmate showing me the "Winter Wrap Up" song. I quickly dismissed it because ack! Colorful characters singing a happy song! Then sometime later <a class="urllink" href="http://wow.joystiq.com/">WoW Insider<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for some reason posts this.

<p></p>Ponies kicking dragons! Kicking lions! Star bears! Evil overlord pony with stars for hair! Clearly this show was more epic than I gave it credit for,  so I did research. I went to TV Tropes. I went to Youtube,  watch a bunch of short clips and other PMV's &amp; pony trailers before moving on to full episodes. It all happened so fast,  but by the end of the week I was sitting in a stream chat room watching the then latest episode "Green Isn't Your Color".
<p></p>And that's how I <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokingMode" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokingMode">lost control of my life</a>!

            Again with how I joined fandom stuff.  I don't mind I like that topic ;D
<p></p>I actually wanted good MLP cartoon and not to sugary just so all would be wrong (however I wasn't aware that first show was almost near this). And while I was still neutral toward at best toward MLP  I  was OK with seeing  fanart from I artist I know or avatars on forum.
<p></p>One day I saw entry on Know Your Meme,   checked it out and it blown  my mind. I didn't  expect that memetic potential and internet popularity from guys like 4chan.
<p></p>So I started reading more about it (TV Tropes article as aways) and I watched pilot,  loved it. I put it between other  shows I liked and to watch later or watch occasionally. But I kept watching episodes what sounded interesting and some other pony videos.  At some point I realized I'm fan of it and watched all episodes.
<p></p>It took more than week from discovery to watch all eps,  when I finished Dog And Pony show was new one recently uploaded on YT.

<p></p>I was actually surprised by the lack of action when I watched the show,  because the Skyrim trailer made it look a lot more epic then it is. Apparently,  the trailer used pretty much every action scene from the first 2/3rds season 1.

            How I became a brony? I was heavy into <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamFortress2" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a> at the time. I found a nice server called "legion of Ponies" or something,  and they had a nice habit of micspamming songs. One of the songs that was played most often was Winter Wrap Up.
<p></p>I had heard of the meme before,  and I didn't feel like getting into it just for the heck of it,  but I liked the song,  so I checked the youtube clip for Winter Wrap Up. I saw just how nice the animation looked,  and just how much <em>care</em> seemed to be put into the series. Then I watched the first episode,  and decided at 7 minutes and 25 seconds in that I'll be following this.

            Me,  I started finding ponies getting mentioned around this wiki,  and some offhand mentions to them elsewhere. I started getting familiarized to the series through the trope page,  as it happens with a lot of stuff,  and in one of those little wiki walks I ended up reading Dragonshy's recap page,  and,  being stuck in the back seat of a car with a cellphone and 2 hours of road left,  I thought to myself "Okay,  I <em>gotta</em> see that last bit" ("that last bit" referring to Flutters making the dragon cry).
And thus,  I got hooked,  and started to explore the fandom a bit more. All this happened during the season 2 wait,  around July.

            How I became part of the fandom (notice how I am deliberately avoiding using the term brony; don't <em>ever</em> call me one):
<p></p>I initially avoided even considering checking the show out. Not because I thought it was too idealistic girly - one my favorite series of all time is <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ARIA" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ARIA">ARIA</a>,  that should be enough - but because back then all the info I had were the previous generations and the art looked just <strong>horrible.</strong>
<p></p>Then I came across the legendary "Flutterguy" clip,  which was (in my opinion) THE funniest moment from this series until Ponyville Confidential.
<p></p>My reaction to the pilot was rather mixed,  but good enough. The whole plot was,  to be frank,  a load of horse sense in my standards. However,  during the very first couple of minutes after the intro,  such as Twilight running toward the library (Canterlot library?) and floating around bunch of books,  mesmerized me with its fluid animation that I've never seen before in other cartoons (admittedly I don't watch a lot of western animated series).
<p></p>To be honest,  though,  the pilot,  the first season,  and really,  the series as a whole is pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage">So Okay, It's Average</a> for me. What sealed the deal was actually the fanworks,  which just cannot be described.
<p></p>So yeah,  there is that. It's a good show. Never great,  and never will be,  but absolutely enjoyable.

            Perhaps my way into the fandom was a bit unusual from the rest of you guys. Though it'd been a while before I found this gen,   was already a general G1 fan so there was a lot less mental barriers to get through before I could give it a try.
So it wasn't that I thought ponies weren't cool,  I was just convinced it'd be another sugary cartoon like G3. Though oddly enough,  after watching seasons 1 and 2 in one sitting in the middle of the s3 break,  I did a binge on the previous shows and I actually enjoy them more than I did before. Maybe after seeing how good FIM is,  it made all the gems in the previous gens stand out even more.
<p></p>In any case,  I'm a general MLP fan these days. What's more,  it got me into other shows and I'm now a fan of Rainbow Brite and Strawberry Shortcake. So I guess you never know what you'll turn out liking.
