            (WOW this moved fast) @Tigger,  couple pages back: As a proponant of Babs being their,  daughter,  I'll feild this one:
<p></p>One,  we have no indication Babs' older sister is actually AJ's age. She could be as little as a single year older - a common age difference for siblings being merely a year or two. At that age,  considering we didn't see AB in AJ's flashback we have no reason to assume that she was born but simply wasn't shown on-screen due to being too young,  or what have you. Furthermore,  I still hold to the notio nthat she <em>coud</em> have been referring to AJ as an unofficil big sister. IF AJ could just drop in on Aunt and Uncle Orange,  we have to assume the families are close.
<p></p>Two,  Children don't always have the same accents as their parents(Assuming we ever heard Aunt and Uncle speak - I'd have to go back and check the episode to be sure). In fact,  in a lot of cases it's quite uncommon. If the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ORanges" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ORanges">O Ranges</a> moved to a different city,  or even a different neighborhood,  then Babs would exhibit a different accent. Even then,  there's no saying that one accent would be unnaceptable amongst the other accents of high scoiety. There's a steryotype that certain accents are dumb,  yeah,  but a moment's thought tells us that's absurd.
<p></p>Finally,  we have no indication that Aun and Uncle Orange are themselves <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwits" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwits">Upper Class Twits</a>. Bear in mind,  they took a young girl into their home. They didn't <em>have</em> to do this. They had no real reason to,  aside from the fact that she was family. She may not even have been true family,  but simply the child of a family friend. Not only did they take her in,  they brought her to one of their events and tried to make her feel welcomed! This is not the behaviour of upper class twits. They and their lot may have been a tad ignorant to not know what a rooster was,  yes,  but they were not unkind or self-centred ponies at all,  which is a heavy element of being an upper class twit.
<p></p>Ultimately,  considering the only relatives we know of in Manehatten are the Oranges(And that there seems to be little call for farmers in a metropolitan city),  assuming that she's the daughter of the Oranges is wholly reasonable,  perhaps even <em>more</em> reasonable than assuming she wasn't. Assuming that she's not their daughter leans,  as I've demonstrated,  on just as many assumptions one way or another. The simple fact of the matter is that it's not supported or denied by canon,  and could therefore go either way. Any evidence to one or the other is circumstantial,  if not outright invented for the purposes of fanon. In that situation,  there's no question that's 'silly'.

            Yeah,  the only thing we know about Babs' parentage is that the writer hadn't thought about it when creating the character,  and it it could go either way.

            @Enlong: That was only in the immediate timeframe,  though.  It's entirely possible that if say,  Apple Bloom got her CM,  Scoots and Sweetie might be initially happy for her,  but start to grow more bitter now that she has less reason to hang around with them.

            Seems to me that,  if anyone,  Sweetie and Scoots are the <em>least</em> likely to hold that sort of grudge.
<p></p>I mean,  as of The Cutie Pox,  it's kind of obvious that each of them are more happy to spend time with the other two and partake in wacky hijinx than frustrated by the lack of accomplishing the "main" goal.

            <div class="quoteblock">Trixie was never Twilight's arch-nemesis. She was too small-fry for that. S He was closer to Rainbow Dash's arch-nemesis and even then it didn't fit. Twilight's nknownRival would be a better descripter.</div>
Yeah,  I'm wondering about adding Trixie as an example on the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">Unknown Rival</a> page,  but I'm not sure if that would be shoehorning or not. On the one hoof,  Twilight obviously made a much bigger impression on Trixie than vice versa (I don't recall Twi ever mentioning Trix in the interim between "Boast Busters" and "Magic Duel"). On the other hoof,  the Unknown Rival trope usually plays out with the one party not even recognizing their "rival",  but Twi didn't have any trouble recognizing Trixie in "Magic Duel".

            @Meta: I don't think it quite fits; Trixie's motivation is less a personal vendetta against Twilight and more wanting to salvage her reputation.  Twilight was obviously involved in it,  but I'm not sure that's her primary motivation.  There are definitely elements of it though.  Not sure whether it's enough to merit a mention.
