            I suppose the real issue is the lack of overall consistency. Even among the more powerful Unicorn and Pegasi characters there's some pretty wide divides between episode,  or between scenes. Rainbow Dash is able to pull off something that was legend before? Yeah,  there's another pony that's just as fast as her. Twilight can pull of any number of tricks,  except when it would solve the problem. We kinda have to assume that similar issue apply to earth ponies - Big Mac can pull a house when it's funny,  but barely hold up a cake when <em>it's</em> funny.
<p></p>There's also the trouble of "AJ is a background pony syndrome" either way. Because the EP 'powers' don' have flash they get ignored,  so as I just demonstrated very impressive feats can get written off as narrative devices and not 'proof' of anything.
<p></p>An of course,  lastly,  this isn't really a show meant to <em>have</em> power levels.

Yeah,  there's another pony that's just as fast as her.</div>
<p></p>No rainboom,  so RD wasn't at full speed. Also,  people forget that people simply <em>don't</em> use maximum effort most of the time. In fact,  it's <em>suicidally stupid</em> to use maximum effort in most situations. It's not usually a good idea to use maximum effort. Even in a fight for your life,  it's not usually a good idea. And as power goes up,  the importance of that does as well.

            I prefer the explanation that all ponies are a hive mind,  and that they can shunt power from one body to the other as the situation requires. You might ask,  'Then why do they often work antagonistic to each other and exhibit different personalities?' The answer is simple,  the meta-pony has severe depression and hates herself,  always working counter to her own hopes and desires.

            Can we not start yet another argument about whether non EP's can grow food or not? Every time it comes up we basically default to "we don't have enough info to argue one way or another. The only hard statement we have is a line from a play that probably takes some artistic license.  It's probably roughly as accurate a portrayal of Equestria's founding as <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeventeenSeventySix" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeventeenSeventySix">SeventeenSeventySix</a> is an accurate portrayal of the American Revolution.  Based on true events and a decent summary of what happened,  but takes a lot of license with details.

            Actually,  I never considered the Doctor,  though it'd make things a lot easier if he was messing around with history. But basically,  I think it works like this:
In G1,  Megan and friends continued fighting off attacks from various villains trying to destroy Dream Valley. However,  over some years the constant battles started getting to them,  Megan in particular. eventually deciding that the constant magical invasions would one day destroy ponykind,  with help from the Moochick they combine the Sunstone,  the princess ponies' magic keeping Dream Valley enchanted,  and the Rainbow of Light to create a device that would neutralize any magic getting into Ponyland. However,  the device backfires and instead sucks up all but the most powerful magic from the world.
Having no one else to turn to without magic to make life sustainable and forever feeling guilty,  Megan teaches the ponies about human customs and means of survival. Eventually the memory of her fades over time and the ponies progress on their own. Thus,  the all but magicless world of My Little Pony Tales.
It gets vague and I'm not quite sure how it quite goes after this. The Alicorn from Up Up and Away seen by Patch and Bon Bon is a descendent of the powerful unicorns of Mimic's line and the Flutterponies. The 8 ponies being the only ones to really believe they exist,  they're sent on a quest to recover the Rainbow of Light and restore magic to the world as the few surviving magical creatures have all but died out. Eventually,  they succeed in restoring magic while still leaving some technological artifacts. The other races don't recover magically as fast as the ponies,  leaving a new world for the ponies to live in peace. And there you have G3. However,  with the excess of harmony,  a balance between chaos and harmony is broken and the resulting backlash of chaos allows Discord to be created. The pony races who were just beginning to reunite after centuries of separation quickly devolve into   infighting as the chaos drives them to acts of anger and negative emotions.
<p></p>The alicorns decide to act and come out of hiding. The most powerful leaders at the time,  Celestia and Luna,  recover the Rainbow of Light and divide them into the Elements of Harmony. The rest as they say,  is history.
<p></p>Edit: As an afterthought,  the half-forgotten legend of Megan inspires Lyra's curiosity towards humans. I don't always like that fannon trait of her's,  but it's there. Also,  the way of crossing to the human world must still exist,  but has been reshaped and changed over the centuries. So with all that,  in this fanonical timeline Equestria Girls could happen.

            @Sereg: Well,  by that same logic LD might not have been going at max capacity,  either. She certainly showed she could go beyond the level RD was operating at on some occasions.
<p></p>Too much fanon is always brought in on these discussions to cover the fact that canon really isn't as all-encompassing as all that,  because it was never designed to <em>have</em> legitimate power levels. I think,  if we really must,  then we should limit it to the 'saga' arc(Season 1 opener and season 2 and 3 opener and closer),  since that's the only place where combative power,  and power in general,  is taken into serious account. Which means basically the only things we KNOW about power are that Fluttershy resists corruption,  Twilight is exponentially powerful magic-wise,  Dash can pull off a Rainboom effectively at will,  and all six of them can hold their own in a brawl.
