            Regarding that reddit debate about Equestria Daily... Well,  I'd be lying if I said I was completely pleased with the way the site currently works. I think some of that particular commentator's complaints are exaggerated and even contradictory,  but I do feel that Equestria Daily has such an overwhelming importance in the fandom that Sethisto & Co should be very careful about the presentation. I literally could not get through the Thiessen interview because the constant use of pony-terms - the whole situation,  really - was too awkward.
<p></p>All the same,  I am not sure what can be done about it. At best,  you could maybe send in some very convincing emails to get the staff to tone it down a bit,  but I'm not sure how willing they'd be to listen.

            @ Death Cloud.  Unfortunately,  I think that guy has a point. Equestria Daily is the public face of the fandom and some of the stuff there doesn't help our image.  The idea of making the creators of the show uncomfortable with the fandom makes me feel pretty darn crappy.

            Looking at Death Cloud's thing,  I will admit the site is mismashed and poorly organized and it's why I don't go to it. I basically get all of my info from here or the Bronyville podcast.

            I don't find ED badly organized. In fact,  I really don't see the problem with every different sort of media and news coming through the same "stream." I mostly don't care about stuff like PMVs,  but I have no problem ignoring them. The tag system seems adequate to me for finding specific kinds of posts.

            I've said it before,  but it's definitely possible to enjoy something deeply without letting it define you.  If we're creeping out the creators,  then we're doing something wrong - maybe the individuals themselves,  maybe the fandom as a whole.  It's hard to make a call on that one,  but really,  when that starts happening,  it's time to step back and take a look at ourselves,  I think.

            I think the main problem is that sometimes the site views itself as being primarily for the fans,  and sometimes forgets that it's also basically the face of the fandom.  Sort of like how I don't worry much about posting those stupid "Rainity" videos here because everybody knows it's a joke,  but I definitely wouldn't if I thought that people who weren't part of the fandom looked to this thread as the main source of info about the show and the fandom,  I probably wouldn't.
<p></p>ED was created for the fans,  not for outside observers,  so in that light,  stuff like inside jokes and using "everypony" and things like that are fine.  The issue is that the site is shifting away from being primarily for fans and is being used to represent the fandom as a whole,  and the content isn't exactly changing enough to reflect that.

            Some of the fandom fanficting isn't that bad,  it's basically what Lauren used to do herself. I bet it's the R34 and some of the uncomfortable creepy some of the less stable bronies have,  as well as the uncomfortable amount of Fandumb.
