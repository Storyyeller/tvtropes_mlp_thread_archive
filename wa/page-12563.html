            To be fair though,  the first 5-10 episodes of the last couple of seasons didn't have a whole lot of fantastic episodes,  either. There were some good ones,  definitely,  but my favorites have always come from the last half of each season,  I think.

Less so for The Crystal Empire,  that was more innovative,  but suffered in execution and I'm not big on the musical numbers (maybe if they hadn't milked them,  they could have had more time to properly develop the actual plot).

            I never really had that "beginning of the season doldrums" that a lot of people seem to have. In fact I find that the season usually tapers out near the end.

            My favorite episodes are in a variety of order,  though I find most of the more mediocre ones are around the middle of the season. Like they want to start and end each season with a bang.

            Eh... well for me,  if I were picking top three form each season in season one it's 20,  19 and 25 in that order,  and for Season 2 it's probably 13,  24 and 15. Honorable mention to 03,  though,  sort of about tied for third. So most of the good stuff was in the later half for me,  but there was some good stuff near the beginning.
<p></p>So far for this season it's been this episode,  then OBA and TMPP. Course,  there's only <em>been</em> four episodes this season - This list is excluding the season opener/finisher,  of course I consider those to be sort of in a different league from the rest of the series,  a sort of differently-toned miniseries,  if you will.

<p></p>Outside of a few clear favorites,  I tend to really enjoy most episodes. This most recent one may just crack my Top 5,  though.

            I'd probably say that the weakest season 3 episode so far IMO is One Bad Apple. It's not a bad episode or anything,  I just didn't like it as much as the others. My favorite episode of season 3 right now is definatly Magic Duel. That episode was just fantastic.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>I will say that the new episode and Stare Master are probably my favorite CMC episodes so far though.

            Hey marston.
<p></p>As said,  none of the episodes so far have been terrible,  but I think only the recent couple have been when things have started to rise up in quality and challenge some of the better moments of previous seasons.

            I don't really see much of a correlation between place in season and quality,  other than the first season having a slow start.  Although even then it has a few strong episodes like Dragonshy and Bridle Gossip.  Season 2 felt pretty well spread out to me; I consider the first five episodes all pretty strong,  and the finale is great,  and the second half of the season had good stuff like Hurricane Fluttershy and <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMMystery" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMMystery">MM Mystery</a>.  So yeah,  I don't really see there being much of a relationship there.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I will say that so far this season hasn't quite gotten off to the start that last season did.  Not that the episodes so far have been bad,  but of the ones so far Magic Duel is the only one that elicited a "Holy crap that was awesome" reaction from me.  The others have been far from horrible,  but so far they range from "solid" to "That was really good".

            Alright,  I'm onto this episode.
<p></p>The video description says: "The 'Scootaloo is adorable' episode" so I think this is going to be a lighter reaction.

            Scootaloo has seen some shit,  man.
<p></p>When she was younger,  her parents left her at her paranoid,  Vietnag veteran,  unicorn grandfather's house for the weekend,  who used magic to actually project his experiences to Scoots. She may as well have been there.

            Hi Psi.
<p></p>I'm definatly allready looking forward to next week's episode,  since it revolves around RD {Who is my favorite charector in the show alongside Twilight},  and also because I want to see what it'll do with her. One also has to wonder if any controversy will come from it considering what happend with her in the last season.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            Only Scootaloo looks at a cart accident and thinks "Challenge accepted."
<p></p>Also,  I'm hoping this episode actually answers the question of: "Who the hell looks after Scootaloo?" because if it turns out she lives under a railway bridge I think I'll cry a bit. Then think: "Shit,  I was right!"
<p></p>"Rarity loves camping!" -Scene cut to Rarity playing Counter-Strike- "FUCKING CAMPERS! PICK UP A REAL GUN!"
<p></p>oh my god sweeties puppy eyes make it stahp nooo
<p></p>Only Rarity would bring the contents of her fucking house to the forest. And needs to think of clothes to wear outside. And lies to tell her friends so that she can join an exclusive club,  come to think of it.

            Sweetie brought a 12 gauge shotgun and a bunch of body bags.

When we got episodes like Hurricane Fluttershy afterward things cooled down. We've already had a 'nice/competent RD' episode this season so we needn't worry too much yet.
<p></p>One of the fun things is that most of the time the cast ARE <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie">Jerkass Woobies</a> in their own episodes anyway.

<p></p>And that is the source of Scootaloo's nightmares. Even worse than Granddad's Storytime.
