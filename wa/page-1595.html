            Okay,  let's agree on something here,  because I guess you people in this thread are the people most likely to be writing those episode recap pages.
<p></p>Them actually doing exactly what they said they would be doing in Lesson Zero,  with people who aren't Twilight sending letters to Princess Celestia,  is <em>not</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a>. Saying they're going to do a thing in future episodes in one episode and then actually doing it in those future episodes is just plain,  simple,  normal continuity.

            Wait,  who wants Gilda dead?  That's a bit much.
<p></p>Btw,  think we'll see any other Griffons in the show...or a Hippogriff?
<p></p>Edit: Some Hippogriff ideas:
<p></p>A 1st gen. Hippogriff is basicially a Griffon with the lion parts replaced with pony parts.  They have cutie marks.
<p></p>A hippogriff born to a hippogriff/pony couple can vary wildly in appearance.  They could be a big pony with clawed forelimbs and a feathered mane,  or just a large pony,  or more like a regular hippogriff.

            Yeah,  wanting Gilda to die is pretty terrible. On the subject of whether she can be redemmed or not I fall into the category of can't be redeemed. To me she just seems to stubborn and prideful to be able to learn her lesson.

            None of the minor antagonists are bad enough to deserve death or any equivalent fate.  Maybe a little roughed up (I think Gilda would probably have to pick a fight with something she can't handle or just blow off to really learn her lesson.  Trixie would probably need to have her "provoke and then assault" routine turned against her.  Blueblood could maybe have a bigger jerk act more self centered around him or maybe have his selfishness screw up something big that makes him rethink things),  but not death.

            I don't think it's not so much that Gilda can't take a prank but that she was pranked constantly at a party for her. I'd like to see you keep your cool when one person is specifically pranking you over and over and nobody sees anything wrong with it.
<p></p>All the stuff she did before was pretty bad though.

            ^^That just sounds like a euphemism.
<p></p>^It seems to be part that she can't take her own medicine and part that she believes that Pinkie set up all the pranks strictly to target her - because that's how she would do it.  She doesn't get that Pinkie legitimately wants to cheer her up,  so she must be getting mocked - that's how her mind works.

Every prank was set up specifically for her,  except it was Rainbow who set them up not Pinkie. Unless Rainbow was covering for Pinkie. But yeah she couldn't handle her own medicine.

            I know he's sort of become my personal pet baddy at this point,  but if you think how the fandom treats Gilda is bad,  you should see how people react to Blueblood. I swear,  at least the people who like Gilda get some degree of representation. I've seen maybe two or three fics aside from mine that don't play him as the villain. Okay,  granted,  he was antagonistic,  but he's nowhere <em>near</em> as reprehensible as those fics that do play him as the villain make him out to be.

There was that Legion of Gloom one but I stopped reading that when the authour self inserted themselves into it. I've read a few where he was a jerk,  a few where he was a heroic jerk and quite a few where he is either secretly a good guy or improves himself.
<p></p>I've read plenty of comments on youtube videos and the like and they really hate him.

<p></p>Actually,  no. The pranks were all set up for everyone at the party. It was coincidence,  and Gilda's desire to be the 'star of the show' that made them all be set upon Gilda.

In a sense he seems to exist only to crush Rarity's dream at the Gala,  and his personality (or lack therof) is designed specifically around that fact.

            I don't like those  antagonist white washing fics.  Maybe if those were about something else and  show jerk redemption was only result of plot and character development not purpose of fic or it's arc.

            Yeah... it's the same issue as DT and SS. They just don't have the focus that Gilda and Trixie got.

            I've only read one story where Blueblood was a villain and he was really just being a general douchebag,  it was the Vinyl Scratch tapes. I mean really,  the demonizing/leather pantsing of any of these characters is ridiculous,  you'd think people would find away to be reasonable or something. Blueblood's a jerk,  not a monster. Gilda is selfish and bossy and controlling,  but hardly the worst the show has to offer and Trixie was a minor annoyance,  sh's a frikkin' flea.

            I would like to take a moment to point out that we are discussing fan-fiction here.  Even more so than most other forms of literature,  they're subject to the "sounds stupid until you read it" rule.

            I'm with Mio on this one; Blueblood is more of a plot device than anything else; even Gilda sort of had some inner conflict about her bitchiness (she really did seem to want to be Rainbow Dash's friend),  but Blueblood pretty one-dimensional.  I still wouldn't want to see him killed or anything (he's a jerk,  not a monster),  but I can see why people tend to react that way.  He's basically designed to be disliked.

<p></p>Anyone ever written an AU fic in that sense? Don't force your sense of fun on others,  Pinkie,  don't think wild,  captive animals will automatically like you when they've never met you before,  Fluttershy,  don't expect the Princess to spend too much time with you personally at an official event,  Twilight,  don't expect a Prince to just want to marry you off-the-bat,  Rarity,  and don't expect him to be automatically nice,  don't expect to make lots of money out of opening an <em>unauthorized</em> shop in the middle of an official event where people probably aren't even carrying any money on them,  and don't expect those people are going to pay such ludicrous prices that you'll be able to make cutting-edge surgery on your grandma,  AJ,  and don't expect the Wonderbolts to spend all their attention on <em>you</em> RD.
<p></p>REALLY,  they ALL had in common that they had a SELF CENTERED perspective of the party. I think being the main characters of their own stories has them a little <em>spoiled</em> when it comes to that.
