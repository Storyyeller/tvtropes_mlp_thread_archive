            I get why I'm Applejack (honest,  diligent,  simple tastes),

            This is the description it gives me:
<p></p>Chronically weak and timid,  but with a heart of solid gold,  you tend to require and depend on the help of your friends in most situations. You enjoy their company,  but also enjoy solitude and time away from your friends where you can enjoy the sounds of nature. Just because you know you're weak doesn't mean it holds you back,  because you know you're strong where it counts,  with your overabundance of kindness,  caring,  and compassion.
<p></p>You're often worried about saying or doing the wrong things and also fear rejection. Speaking of fear,  you've got a lot of it,  often times letting your fear hold you back from doing even the most simple of things,  such as jumping across a cliff. But in that fear,  you can often find just enough bravery to stand up for doing the right thing if your friends need you.
<p></p>You may be naive and innocent,  and you're very shy and quiet,  but you're also a very good listener and are likely the one your friends blab on about their problems to — and while you may feel powerless to help at times,  just listening and cheering them on means the world to them. Yay!
<p></p>(I guess that that's reasonably true for me and Fluttershy.)

            I took that test and got Applejack,  which was completely unexpected.  I guess her personality in general would be similar to me,  but I'm also more introverted and more into books than outdoor/active work like Twilight (who WAS a close second,  at least).  But Applejack's blunt honesty and stubbornness would definitely be similar to me,  as well as her preference for practical clothes over being fashionable (and I did pick apples as my favorite fruit with strawberries as a close second).  I'm also surprised I got Pinkie Pie last,  since I thought Rainbow Dash or Rarity would be last since they're the ones I identify least with.  With Pinkie I at least identify with her creative silly randomness.
<p></p>This is the link to my results:

<p></p>I have a question about Snails,  is he really supposed to have a Canadian accent?  He doesn't really sound that way to me,  but I may not be all that familiar with that accent so I could be missing something.  Is it because he said "eh" once in Boast Busters?

            I think Rarity both is and isn't accurate. I am extremely self-conscious,  but about the general impression I make rather than my appearance. I don't like to get my hooves dirty,  and I admit I can be kinda melodramatic. Also,  while I don't put much effort into my own appearance,  I am very aesthetics-conscious and appreciative of beauty.

            This is what mine said;
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">A real hard worker you are,  yup. If there's one thing you hate,  it's being inactive or coming across as lazy. You'll put in more effort than anyone else,  even if it may be against your better judgement or even if delagating your work is a smarter option. It's not surprising to see you working all day long,  even if it's to help friends out. However,  friendship is still important to you,  so you will always,  always stick to your commitments and keep your promises.
<p></p>You're a tell-it-like-it-is pony,  not holding your tongue and telling whoever whatever's on your mind or what your true thoughts are. Thankfully,  you can still pick your words carefully and still keep some sensitivity towards what you say. But,  others may find you irritable in appearance if you're not getting your way or you feel against something.
<p></p>You are also most likely to be athletic and into staying fit,  knowing that if you're not,  you won't be able to keep up with your work. Fashion and looking good aren't on the top of your priorities,  to say the least. You also tend to be very protective of your friends,  standing up for them against anyone who is causing them problems,  and usually succeeding in warding off any foes. You'd gladly lose a limb if it meant saving a friend's life.</div>
<p></p>First paragraph:  Yup.  I agree with that.  When I'm in work,  I hate standing around doing nothing.  Makes me feel lazy.  Plus,  my mates come first,  though I regret to say that I can't always stick to my commitments...but I try at least.
<p></p>Second paragraph:  The second part is true,  about picking your words carefully.  But I'm not really a tell-it-like-it-is person 100% of the time...more like 20% of the time.  I prefer the easier option of staying quiet until I have no choice.  Which leads to...
<p></p>Third paragraph:  All true.  I've chased the little scrote who beat my brother right into his house,  threw gatecrashers at a friends party out on their ass,  and I used to take my boxing seriously,  till I give it up.

            Like Twi,  I'm very bookish,  geekish,  awkward,  and a bit of a shut-in. My knowledge pool is less deep and more ultra-wide,  spanning everything from electronics and programming to animation and even geology and weapons and <em>science</em>.
<p></p>Like Rarity,  I can be very <em>particular</em> about some details,  and can appreciate artsy stuff. I'm not really hung up on appearances,  but there are <em>standards</em>. Seriously. Been on both ends of the Sisterhooves Social fiasco. I <em>live</em> in a carefully sorted pile of organised chaos!
<p></p>Like Pinkie,  I can tap into an immense wellspring of <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoCapriSun" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoCapriSun">So Happy</a></em>,  have surprising amounts of energy and speed and strength for my crappy fitness,  and poke holes in the fourth wall. I'm also one hell of a gamer,  although I'm no party animal. (I've gone Pinkamena before too!) My calculated guesses can be nearly as accurate as Pinkie Sense sometimes,  even when I'm throwing out WMGs! I can even sneak up on people like a ninja. Sometimes.
<p></p>...This quiz is surprisingly accurate.

            I'm Rainbow Dash! Unexpected but I'll take it.
<p></p>Now back to my sport free life wait a second.
<p></p>"You also <strong>could</strong> care less about your looks and appearance. You're too cool to care."
<p></p>RAGE!!!
<p></p>That phrase makes no sense. If there was a scale in arbitrary units of caring then if I was able to care less then I must care somewhat,  perhaps a little perhaps a lot,  but I must care. That is not what the phrase is implying. The phrase is implying that I do not care at all. If this was the case then what should be written is that I could<strong>n't</strong> care less. Because on the scale of arbitrary units of caring that would be a 0 I would physically not be able to care any less than I currently do which is what that sentence implies. And I answered that a Top Hat and Monocle would be perfect accessories anyway.
<p></p><strong>RAGE!</strong>
<p></p>Also,  I'm joint second with Twilight and Pinkie. And I prefer Mentally Advanced Series to Friendship is Witchcraft.
