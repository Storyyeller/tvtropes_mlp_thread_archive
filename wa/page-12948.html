            Crappy Mary Sue self inserts?  I guess it's possible that she's somehow wrangled an amazing work of fiction out of that premise,  but its not very likely,  especially given that she probably doesn't have much in the way of experience writing prior to a few months ago.

<p></p>As for RD's book quality: several reasons to assume that it's not very good.
<p></p>1. The plot is extremely cliche and obviously a self insert.  She obviously didn't put much thought into the premise.
<p></p>2. More importantly,  she takes Rarity's compliment at face value,  which means she doesn't seem to really be very aware of what's considered good writing.  Even if she willingly chose a cheesy premise,  a good author would be aware that the summary sounds dumb.
<p></p>3. Given how utterly averse she was to reading,  I can't imagine that she has much experience when it comes to writing.  I seriously doubt that she focused much on it in school,  and it's probably not very important for her job,  so her ability is probably extremely unpolished.
<p></p>Basically,  there's nothing that <em>necessarily</em> means it's terrible; it's possible that it could be good,  but it's highly unlikely.  I mean,  RD is always more of a doer than a thinker; her personality just doesn't lend itself well to things like planning ahead,  or proof-reading.

            Now I'm reminded of a fic I read where Twi and RD got into a write off,  using romance as their topic.  RD wrote like 100 pages of an obvious self insert having sex with the author of the Daring Do books.  Then it turns out Daring Do's author is Twilight's mom.  Then it turns out Rainbow already knew that and doesn't see why it's weird.

            oh and figured out why Spike's characterization got mangled for the sake of the story,  check who the writer was.
<p></p>She's doing better,  but needs to learn that the story serves the character,  not the other way around.

            Oh no...I just checked for my essay score there...it's 42%...which is abysmal.  This means that once again my education is hanging in the balance.

            You know what would be an interesting scenario? If <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</a></em> were combined together. Some people might think that's like trying to mix oil and water,  but they do have some things in common. In particular,  the stallion Kokuoh (Japanese for "Black King") would make an interesting character.
<p></p><ol><li> Kokuoh survived a nuclear war and leads a herd of wild horses.
</li><li> Kokuoh tried protecting an injured foal from a bunch of tigers.
</li><li> Kokuoh had a wrestling match with giant,  beefy Raoh before he let Raoh ride him.
</li><li> Kokuoh got punched by Kenshirou...and survived. Keep in mind that Kenshirou has killed plenty of humans with one punch.
</li><li> Kokuoh stomps and kills humans under his hooves on a day-to-day basis. Easy for him to do,  since he's the size of an elephant.
</li><li> Kokuoh is quite intelligent and has a sense of compassion,  like when he silently urged Raoh to bury Juza.
</li></ol><p></p>I wonder what it would be like if Kokuoh and Big Macintosh met each other. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin">

            Actually,  I was thinking a bit about that,  and I came to the conclusion that Spike didn't <em>choke</em> the timberwolf,  he <em>clogged</em> it. They were always blowing that nasty breath stuff,  so my headcanon is that the rock blocked up the nasty-breath thing,  so it built up and basically caused the timberwolf to pop.  Yeah,  no evidence,  but it makes more sense than choking.
<p></p>I wouldn't call Spike's character necessarily mangled either. It's exaggerated a bit,  but it's not like he hasn't had absentminded or clumsy moments before.  She just pushed it too far into slapstick.

            Like I said,  she's doing a hell of a lot better then last season,  but still the least good writer on the staff. They've at least gotten into her head that being overly cynical just for the hell of it becuase it more "realistic" does not mesh with this show,  and fixed her horredous characterization of RD from last season,  but this ep shows she's still willing to put the story/joke before the character
