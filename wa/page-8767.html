            Hey that reminds me - I was really surprised when I watched parts of the Matt Engarde case. The summary I read made it sound like theres suddenly a big choice and you have to be smart enough to pick the right option to get the good ending. But when I actually looked at some of the videos,  it looks like the entire second day of the trial is dedicated to dropping as many hints as possible about what to do.

            @Lurker: Well to be fair,  the west also gets a lot of dumbed down kids animes which are basically toy advertisements,  eg. near anything 4Kids got their paws on,  so saying we only get a taste of the good stuff isn't quite true.
<p></p>Anime does a lot of 'characters' thoughts speaking' moments compared to Western Animation,  which are mostly just a voice explaining what's going on,  I'll give it that.

            @Psi What the localization and licensing companies do to butcher what they acquire has nothing to do with the fact that the shows picked up in America are almost always popular in Japan. Usually,  things don't get popular without having enough quality in them to acquire the necessary fanbase.

            I noticed when I first got into Anime.. that Anime tended to have way more serious storylines than WA.  But this was a good 10-15 years ago and WA has made leaps and bounds in its ability to tell a serious story in a way that is still appropriate for the target audience.

<p></p>I dislike it when the exposition leaks into fight scenes though (one of the reasons I stopped reading Shonen)

            @Psi That's the popularity of Sonic,  though,  whose name alone has been able to sell even really crappy games in America. And in any case,  of course there are going to be exceptions. It's just a general trend.

            Sonic as a whole isn't actually that popular in Japan.
<p></p>@ginger: It tends to be of mixed variety for me,  since I find a lot of anime action scenes without exposition or emotional drama are rather generic without someone discussing over it,  especially since so many of them recycle power up and attack animations over and over.

            @Ace: A pony anime actually may not be that different depending on who they decide to market to.
<p></p>Speaking of anime I finished Code Geass R2,  it was pretty good,  in fact i think I enjoyed it more then the first season. Not sure why it was reviled so much.
