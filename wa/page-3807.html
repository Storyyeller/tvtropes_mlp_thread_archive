            I love the humor and the characters. Captain Haddock is a sight to behold,  he is so flawed with his short temper and his blatant drinking problem but he's a straight up determinator and the best voice of reason Tintin could ask for,  and he's such a nice guy underneath all the yelling.
<p></p>Then there's Thompson and Thomson,  the most hilarious incompotenent cops you'd ever seen,  the things that happen to them I cannot even begin to describe,  but they're such nice guys even though half the time they're going after the wrong people for all the wrong reasons.
<p></p>The adventures are always amazing and spectacular,  Tintin can take you anywhere,  Asia,  South America,  Turkey,  you'd think the moon would be too far but they made it work. And the bad guys are truly dastardly. Pragmatic,  scheming and always some step ahead of our hero but each of them unique.

            Indeed,  I love Sow,  Snowy was my favorite before Haddock came along.
<p></p>And you all know how I harp on about varied character design and laziness *coughjohnjosecocough* but Herge had character design in spades,  each and ever single face is unqiue,  and so is the character of each individual face,  and he probably has the highest beard quotient of any artist I know of.

            I pretty much agree with everything Mousa said.  In addition,  the many phrases of Haddock are the reason why he's my favourite character.

            @Ginger (Concerning <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinTin" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinTin">Tin Tin</a> villains): I liked the recurring villain Rastopopulos for actually being mostly successful and actually evading death quite a few times,  although he clearly gets less competent by the last few books due to villain decay.
<p></p>The one-shot villains like the gangsters from <em>America</em> and the Japanese Imperial-Military officials who were clerly part of the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WW2" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WW2">WW 2</a> pre-occupation of China in <em>The Blue Lotus</em> were fairly lame,  although the racist guys from that story made for surprisingly effectively obstructive jerks. There are also some fairly stereotypical period villains like the Banana Republic Generalissmo.
<p></p>It'd be interesting to have a recurring villain pony like ol' Rasto,  only he degrades because his escapes from death have caused some degree of brain damage from repeated oxygen loss (A consequence of near-drowning several times,  surviving getting crushed and falling off cliffs,  and so on).

            Your tastes are very particular. There's some pretty good villains in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinTin" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinTin">Tin Tin</a>,  only I can't remember all of them. Rasto was my fvourite,  because he's always a genuine threat.
<p></p>I only accept Villain Decay if it's a consequence of plausible long-term damage (like surviving head injuries or suffocating situations resulting eventually in some degree of brain damage). Given the kind of crazy things Rasto survived,  brain damage was almost certainly going to be inevitable at some point.

            But that's just it,  Red. Don't write the villain to be able to stay two steps ahead of the hero unless you can think of a believable way for the hero to best him in the end.
<p></p>There's a difference between the hero becoming better and the villain becoming worse

            @Ginger But you've made it very clear that you hate heroes that are more powerful than the villains,  as well as a distaste for heroes who are better at planning than the villains. That pretty much leaves winning through blind luck and not winning at all for resolutions,  neither of which are very satisfying.

The heroes should always just <em>barely</em> be good enough to beat the villans.

            Unfortunately,  if villains are <em>too</em> competent,  heroes are less likely to spare them. There's a whole plot about this in the Discworld's <em>The Last Hero</em>.
