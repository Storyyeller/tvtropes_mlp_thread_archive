            My only real complain is that Peewee didn't show up at all.  His entire entry into the series was a pivotal moment in Spike's growth,  and to see him just shunted to the sidelines was...not good. :/

            That was a great episode.
<p></p>A liiiittle saddened at Peewee's absence,  but it's nice that they gave a concise explanation for that.

<p></p><span class="blue">Cracked is irreverent.  They're a comedy site that makes fun of <em>everything.</em>  I don't get why suddenly when our fandom happens to be the butt of the joke,  now everyone gets offended.  It's just one tiny little article that will be forgotten in a couple days.  By now they've gone on to making fun of comic book fans and such.  And it's not as though the article really said anything all that bad about us.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">They pointed out that the fandom had created some strange things,  that,  btw,  were totally true.  All the outrage I keep hearing just comes across as very thin skinned to be honest.  It's not something that should be able to really upset you.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">My only real issue with the article is painting the writing of Fallout Equestria as a symbol of patheticness.  As the article mentioned,  it is long enough to be an actual <em>series</em> of novels.  Yeah,  I think the tone is an awful mess that completely fails to deliver what people like about the series in the first place,  and I would never read it,  but I think it is a bit rude to put someone down for having the dedication to write that much,  especially when so many people enjoy it.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">But aside from that,  I think the article is fine.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">The quality of it is,  as many have noted,  pretty poor.  That's because they let a new columnist write it.  Should they just stop letting new people get the opportunity to write?  Why?  Cracked provides the chance for aspiring comedy writers to get themselves known.  That's a good thing,  even if it means some subpar articles show up from time to time.  You can always just not read them.  Hell,  I already make a point of not reading anything by that talentless hack Gladstone.</span> <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_evilgrin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="evil grin" title="evil grin">

My real issue is that they let two newbies tackle a very... sensitive subject.
<p></p>If it had been one of the more experienced columnists who knows where that second line is,  and how to cross it,  it would be great. As it is,  my main problem is that the writing is too poor to make its subject matter funny,  which is a problem somewhere like Cracked should NOT have.

            @Some New Guy Pee-Wee was diddly squat and frankly I would've preferred a good <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a> instead of <em>any</em> nods to that travesty, mockery of everything the show stands for.
<p></p>But that said, that was a good explanation
<p></p>It was a decent combination of "Secret of My Excess" and "Baby Cakes", but I was hoping to get more from the pets than anything else, ...and I'm sorry but Angel was an asshole this episode, ... I was hoping he'd be cast as the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a>, ... oh well.
<p></p>Opal and Winona were pretty much non starters who could've been absent and nothing would've changed.
<p></p>And I would've preferred a more "Baby Cakes" like plot where it all happened at the library, instead of a misadventures kind of plot. The whole give up a jewel thing was so, ...annoying.
<p></p>Still the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs">CM Cs</a> and Granny Smith bits were excellent, and the end was a good reconciliation.
<p></p>A B seems to be a good grade for this one, since it made quite a few goof-ups and the last episode was a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow">Tough Act to Follow</a>.

            @Blue: That's true but even in the other articles they generally have the attitude of "we're just poking fun of the weirdos" while that one leads off by claiming that the entire fanbase is like that.  That and it broke the cardinal rules of Cracked articles... <em>it wasn't funny</em>. It literally just listed four things and went "hey,  these are terrible!"  There weren't any jokes or clever observations or anything.  The entire content of it is merely "let's laugh at how stupid the bronies are".  The entire thing felt spiteful,  which most articles don't.  Regardless of the subject matter it was just a lousy article.

            Blue: That going against the tone is what makes it such an easy target.  The whole article is rude in general,  which is really standard for sensationalism.  As you said,  nothing really to get worked up about.
<p></p>I personally don't like sensationalism myself and avoid any article of that genre whenever I'm on Cracked.  But really,  that's just one facet of the site.  I rather enjoy their articles about crazy awesome stuff (a lot of which I noticed are about the animal kingdom or military shenanigans).
