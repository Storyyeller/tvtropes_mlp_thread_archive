            Well,  if just aging is considered the absolute pinnacle of magic by Twilight,  who's definitely someone who would know (if not through experience,  then through having spent all but the last two years of her life living in the Canterlot Royal Library and being the personal protege of the most powerful mage on the planet)...
<p></p>I suppose it's possible Celestia could do it and just hasn't told anyone,  but that's an entirely different level.

            Well,  Twilight did straight up confirm that it was impossible <em>for unicorns</em>. There could easily be some other magic out there that does it. Heck,  I bet Poison Joke could do it if it's ironic enough to the victim. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            I think it varies. Some spells are just instinctive,  like Rarity's gem finding spell. Some spells need to be learned and practiced and most importantly understood before they can be cast. Some seem to be able to be cast from physical materials as a one-shot deal with out any learning.

            That still doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you consider that when Twilight unleashed her full magical potential,  she succeded in turning her parents into potted plants. Now,  I understand that those were very unusual circumstances and Twilight has a long way to go before she can use her full potential,  but essentially what this is all saying is that "no,  unicorns could never rearrange the sexual anatomy of living organism,  but they are capable of turning said organism into a completely different kind of organism."
<p></p>I'm sorry but unless Unicorn magic happens to be very arbitrary in what it can and can not do,  then that whole statement by Twilight is just silly. Then again it wouldn't be the first time she got something wrong about the nature of magic.
<p></p>Or,  on the other hand that the rules of magic depend on the writer.

            In any case,  when it comes to spells,  technically,  there are only so many types of spells,  and any new spells are just variations of the superspell. Transformation,  transportation,  illusion,  fabrication,  detection,  and projection is how I'd categorize it. All that changes with the specifics of each spell is what the target/output is. Understanding the mechanics of a certain type of magic would make learning or inventing similar spells a lot easier.

            @Mio: I think the difficulty comes in the fact that you're trying to change only one aspect of the target while keeping everything else basically intact.  Turning a pony into a cactus is easier because you're overwriting them entirely; you don't have to worry about keeping some bits the same.  With a gender-morph or age spell,  you'd have to be a <em>lot</em> more careful in keeping some aspects of the pony the same while only modifying others,  and it could easily be more difficult to figure that out without messing up the pony in question.

            I know,  I know.  Analyzing magic as magic is a lot of fun,  and is consistent with this setting.  I just don't like it when people try to arbitrarily apply our physical rules to a practice that violates as many of those physical rules as it follows.
<p></p>By which I mean,  it feels like arbitrary skepticism to me when someone tries to figure out transfiguration from a rock to a cactus would work while following what we know of physics when magic also includes things like full-body teleportation,  ice spells,  violation of entropy and blah blah blah.

            She's certainly liable to think of it in scientific terms,  even if it's not strictly speaking <em>our</em> science. Like,  maybe she's aware that a mood-altering spell 'alters the balance of the four humours in the body'. In technical fact it would alter the chemicals in the brain,  but it's close enough to her explanation,  hers is just more old-fashioned. I do kinda feel like they need to know what's going on in a spell,  at least if they're trying to invent one - they develop a minor effect intend to cause a major effect.

            @J Teeth: On the other hand,  in order to get the rest of the transformation right you have to summon completely new material,  banish unneeded material,  and rearrange the material in such a way that is completely contrary to how it was arranged before. While the others may involve slightly more precision (and really not that much),  I would think that a spell that completely transforms something would be much more complex,  involving,  and taxing on the unicorn.

<p></p>I dunno. I just don't see why they <em>wouldn't</em> try and analyze it. Twilight tried to analyze Pinkie's magic 'scientifically',  even if she was bad at it.
<p></p>Perhaps their equivalent of science would just be different. Based more on the inherent unpredictability of magic,  developing sort of formulas and the like to control it. Like,  say,  instead of elements they have runes that cause magic to work in a certain way,  and spells are just based on the right combination of runes,  mimicking what we consider chemical reactions. Or is that still too much 'science'?

            @Kegisak: I think the problem is less analyzing magic,  and more analyzing magic in light of our own scientific knowledge that may or may not apply to the setting.  Saying "a spell probably works like this" is one thing,  saying "The spell probably works like this because according to scientific law X" is different.  To use the example you gave,  we don't really have any reason to assume that their brain chemistry is at all comparable to human neurology.  We know the ultimate result is similar,  but it might end up that way by an entirely different mechanism.
<p></p>Basically,  magic <em>can</em> be analyzed,  but consistency within the setting is far more important than consistency with <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> science.  For all we know,  when it comes to magic Conservation Of Mass And Energy isn't as big of a deal.

            @lurker: It still doesn't really demonstrate why a full transformation should be possible while a gender-swap is impossible,  unless it's just arbitrarily impossible because "that's just how unicorn magic works".

            I dunno,  I just prefer a scientific approach to magic that's still at its core magic,  even when you break it down to its smallest elements.  Reducing a spell that,  like you said,  changes someone's mood to forcibly altering their brain chemistry makes it sound like it's just that mages don't understand 'real' science.  A cantrip to make a flame appear over your finger shouldn't work because it excites hydrogen atoms above your finger,  but because it's a little connection with the Plane of Fire,  or something like that.  Does that make sense?

            I still hold to the "all ponies have a natural degree of spell resistance that screws up spells on them".  The reason age magic is possible is that aging is a natural process that actually happens to ponies,  and as a result magic can emulate the effect.  Any given pony was a foal at some point,  and they're <em>going</em> to be old,  and magic is able to temporarily manifest that.  Whereas a pony is never at any point going to arbitrarily switch genders,  so magic has more difficulty creating that effect.

            @Red Yeah,  I get it. I kinda sit in the middle of all that. A fire spell isn't doing crazy subatomic things,  but it isn't summoning fire from another dimension,  either. I see it as a simple projection of heat.
<p></p>Of course,  now we're into subjective headcanons again,  so it doesn't really matter.
