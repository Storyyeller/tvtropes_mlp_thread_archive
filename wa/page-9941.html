            Seasons usually start at around the same time regardless of how many episodes the previous season had.  Season three being shorter is unlikely to result in an earlier season four.

            @Crowfall It all depends on what season model the Hub is choosing. Considering how new the station is,  this could simply be an adjustment of that.

            Again,  why does it matter how short Season 3 is if there's almost certainly going to be a Season 4? Wait until they announce that the show is cancelled before assuming that the show is cancelled.

            What counts as a "movie" is somewhat variable; the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct-to-Video</a> G3 &amp; G3.5 movies were each the length of two <em>FiM</em> episodes,  but <em>FiM</em>'s two-parters aren't considered movies.

            @Osias. Well excuse me but my favorite TV show was derived from a movie and it went on to make a few more. It even made a crossover movie with my other favorite tv show and that show made several great movies on it's own.
<p></p>(That's Jimmy Neutron and Fairly oddparents for the uninformed.)

            Networks order half-seasons all the time.  If the ratings continue to be good (and FIM has to be <em>the</em> most-watched show on The Hub),  they order a full season.  This show is in no danger of being cancelled anytime soon.

            "You don't want it to happen because you just know it will be bad"
<p></p>No,  that's not the case. Let me try a food metaphor: It's not like I "know" the meat they'll cook will be bad,  it's the case I'm vegetarian.
<p></p>That's it! I am movie-of-the-series vegetarian: I don't eat and also don't want other people to eat meat because of the animals suffering.

            @osais So even if the hypothetical movie was made,  and was awesome,  you wouldn't like it solely because it was in a different format?
