<p></p>Sorry,  I didn't know about that. I guess I was wrong with my previous statement.
<p></p>And yeah,  the weirdest part is that Hasbro would go so far to acknowledge these things,  and then suddenly do a 180. I hope that it's the fault of iTunes.

            @ everyone. CALM DOWN,  first off,  saying this just broke the fandom,  or this destroyed anything is WAY to premature,  yes people are pissed,  but we JUST learned about it,  you never go by the very initial burst of emotion,  give it a day or two and let's see what really happens.
<p></p>second,  we have no idea WHAT is going on,  Hasbro has made SEVERAL pro-Derpy statements,  and then we get this,  most people are just confused,  all it will take to get the vast majority satisfies is an explanation.
<p></p>Third,  we do NOT know if this is Hasbro or iTunes issue.

            I think its silly to say it teaches kids to make fun of people who look different.  They honestly need more people and characters in shows who arent completely perfect in looks and abilities so kids learn that being different isnt bad.
<p></p>You show kids perfect characters all the time and of course they are going to see the one oddball as different and weird.

            Yeah,  I'm stepping out for the night as well.  I'm honestly more mad that people are so UTTERLY FUCKING PISSED about something that really isn't a huge deal.  Yes,  it sucks,  but seriously,  the fact that they changed one scene doesn't ruin the entire rest of the show.  I don't like the change either,  but seriously guys,  get over it.  And quit pulling the "onhoes they're never going to give us a shoutout ever again" card.  They just friggin' released a new toyline solely because of the demand of the periphery demographic.
<p></p>And really,  it's not <em>that</em> big of a surprise.  Yeah,  I don't think Derpy was offensive either,  but the mere fact that <em>somebody</em> raised a stink about it is more than enough to get a company to cover themselves.  Especially with something as big as this show.  Even if the show is obviously not ablist,  the mere fact that the accusation was made at all could damage the show's reputation,  so they're taking a "better safe than sorry" route.  It's an overreaction,  but it's not entirely random either.
<p></p>And as noted,  we don't know whether this is an issue with Hasbro themselves or just with itunes.
<p></p>In any case,  I think we should all just take a big step back and chill for a day or two.  I'm pretty sure it was <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CSLewis" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a> who said "I hate and distrust reactions in everything",  because the kneejerk reaction is always the most extreme.  This is only going to be a huge shitstorm if we make it a shitstorm,  so even if it pisses you off,  stay cool about it and wait until we actually know what's going on before rage quitting the fandom or boycotting Hasbro or whatever.

<p></p>I think it was that one seen in <em>Feeling Pinkie Keen</em>,  where she drops a bunch of stuff on Twi and it shows her she was trying to unload said stuff from a delivery truck/cart thing I don't even know.
<p></p>Probably could've phrased that a lot better.

            Really,  the fact that Derpy got changed doesn't bother me nearly as much as the fact that the fandom are largely being buttheads about it.  Seriously.  Okay,  I'm going to bed.  Hopefully to have pony dreams.

<p></p>One of the first fanfics had her as a mailmare back on 4chan. <a class="urllink" href="http://derpyhoovesnews.com/the-origins-of-derpy-hooves/">Here's a nice history of Derpy up to "Luna Eclipsed"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Fun fact,  said fanfic called her Bright Eyes.

            Hasbro should have put a positive spin on it and done an episode with a "Different isnt bad" episode using Derpy/Ditzy as an example.  Like a sure she's got funny eyes and is a little clumsy but did you know she ____insert amazing thing here____.
<p></p>To me changing the eyes is a little bit offensive,  a bit like saying cross eyed people are bad.. I know thats kind of pushing it to extremes but our society and how it pushes for perfection is what causes anorexia and body image/self esteem problems.
