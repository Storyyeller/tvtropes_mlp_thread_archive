            @Sereg: I did say relatively. Chrysalis is not exactly your average opponent,  even without the love. But I guess there is an assumption that if someone can deal godly punishment then they should be able to take it,  which Celestia doesn't in that case. I'm not saying that assumption is necessarily reasonable in this case,  but it does exist.
<p></p>I would also like to point out that there should be <em>something</em> between,  a searing beam and literally calling down the sun in her repertoire.

<p></p>Depends on how "holding back" you are talking about. I meant "holding back" as simply blasting your enemy with concussive force as opposed to getting more creative and using the environment against them.
<p></p>EDIT:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">It's possible that Celestia is superpowerful,  but it seems unlikely given the way she acts in the show. </div>
<p></p>This is another thing I don't get. Is your poer supposed to alter your personality or something?  (Note. I'm not denying that Celestia isn't the most poerful individual in the setting. Discord,  Nightmre Moon,  love-poered Chryslis and Sombra are all stronger).
<p></p>EDIT: Axolotls have gills. And being neotynys,  as mentioned,  it isn't norml for them to metmorphise. They simply reproduce in their larvl form.

            The threshold for being stronger than you can withstand isn't really all that high for most beings.  I mean,  we're a race that's physically capable of killing each other with well-placed <em>drinking straws</em>.
<p></p>I can't really fault Celestia for going down with a laser to the face,  even if she could make a bigger one.  One assumes Chrysalis would have been in similarly poor shape if she lost that one attack instead.

            @Mio: ell yeah. That could be  bit different. I was still assuming her laser was as strong as she could make it (I believe Chrysalis's claim that this demonstrated she was stronger than Celestia),  but Celestia's capable of other spells as previously demontrated. So no walls of fire,  no imploding the building,  no turning the floor into spikes,  no raising the tempurture of the room a few thousand degrees etc.

            I think they meant maturing without changing features.  Basically an Axolotl is a Salamander that never matures beyond the nymph phase... yet still grows in size.
<p></p>Basically spike grows in size but does not gain wings like a "normal" dragon would.

            But that's the thing,  Spike clearly matured in a manner consistent with puberty,  so that part doesn't fit,  and he doesn't bear even a superficial resemblance to an Axolotl.
<p></p>Edit: So the assumption is that since he didn't get wings,  he didn't mature? I don't think that fits what we saw.

            He did not mature so much as merely grew in size.  If true dragon maturity means growing wings then he didn't technically become an adult... he just got bigger.

            He didn't just grow in size though,  he went through clear,  identifiable stages of puberty,  complete with different body types such as the gangly one that corresponded with adolescence,  and the filled out version of adulthood. His long neck,  proportionally small,  differently shaped head,  built up body,  proportionally longer legs,  and quadrupedal stance all fit the bill of a physically maturing creature. I think that the more reasonable conclusion is that he's just a type of dragon that doesn't have wings.

            It wasn't true maturity though as far as we know.
<p></p>Personally I don't think he's a true dragon I think he's a wyrm or some other wingless variant.
<p></p>I just thought it was an interesting theory.

<p></p>Is this really a problem? We have diverse opinions here but I don't think tht's  <em>bad</em> thing.
<p></p>EDIT:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> normal and not boring </div>
<p></p>A little difficult to achieve both of those at the sme time.
