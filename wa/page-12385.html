            I know for one of them the trailers are already being release.d Which is actually funny because I had thought that it was only getting started,  but eh. A second project is already released but it's still being worked on(It's an sort of mini mmo for kids),  the third I don't know if it's independent or related to the second,  and the fourth is my current project,  which is currently unannounced as it's currently pre-alpha and they only recently decided on a name. which I don't actually agree with,  but eh.
<p></p>And yeah,  the gist of the job is I run through the game looking for errors,  try and recreate them,  and if I can cut it down to the exact causes(Which is often kind of tricky,  as there are usually a few errors that are just plain random or have invisible causes),  and then write a 'detailed' bug report. Detailed usually consisting of a description of the bug devs won't read,  a picture demonstrating the issue if possible,  and a list of specific instructions on how to recreate it.
<p></p>My job,  however,  is slightly more advanced. I'm technically a Dev QA,  so I have some added responsibilities. Namely,  the checks. Technically speaking these are the same as regular testing,  but more directed. Firstly there are smoke checks,  wherein we load every single instance of the game to see if it crashes or has any major issue,  which we do for each new build(Which is usually twice a day),  the editor checks,  wherein we test to make sure the tool the devs use to build the game is functioning properly(this is usually only done by one person. Generally it's another fellow,  but when he's away it falls to me because I have more experience in the editor because of my school. Technically speaking,  I'm more efficient at it than the other guy simply due to practice,  but eh),  and finally the milestone checks,  which we do every month or so. In that,  we basically have to rip the build apart in an afternoon in order to see if there are any blockers or major issues on every aspect currently implemented into the game.
<p></p>There's also test plans,  which basically break down a given mechanic/feature into individual aspects so we can test them as thoroughly as possible. Usually a simple task,  though I once had to test one of the games major systems,  which took me the ENTIRE dya. I came in,  sat down,  started working,  and didn't stop until 5:30. Fun day.
<p></p>We're also sometimes asked by the devs to help them with specific tasks. This week we had a meeting with the creative director to give feedback on the game thus far,  and I know one guy is helping a dev implement voice acting into parts of the game. which is really just placing audio spawners in the level,  so it's a simple but tedious task. And of course,  once a day we have scrum meetings to discuss what we'll be doing that day and address what tasks are coming up and what's done,  to make sure the entire game team is up to date on everything.
<p></p>So yeah. Looking for bugs is the main element of what I do,  and everything ties into it,  but it's not <em>all</em> I do. In fact,  randomly running through the game is very rare,  because I usually have something specific that needs me to hammer on it.
<p></p>... jesus,  didn't mean to rant that much. I guess you folks now know all there is to know about my job! Well,  I mean,  sans the bits about dicking around over team chat,  going to office parties and beer fridays,  but eh. you know about the <em>job</em> parts of my job.

            It's not all as handfull-y as it sounds. I mean,  it's not like I do all that every day. Most days I just have a single thing I need to test. For about two weeks now all I've been testing have been the bossfights,  which is pretty simple.
<p></p>Although a game tester pony would be kind of awesome,  actually. I should draw that sometime.

            <div class="quoteblock">@Apple: By my (fanon) current count we have Celestia,  Luna,  Leo,  Cadence,  Tidus(Of the ocean),  Rowan(Of Trees and Wood),  Willow(Of fallen leaves),  Asher(Of Roots),  Petra(Of Soil),  Ciel(Of the Sky),  Mable(Of Precious Things),  J'accuse(Of Justice),  Amos(Of the desert) and the as-yet unnmaed gods of Stone,  Steel,  Storms,  and Wind.
But from the sound of The Cosmic Council my best guess is one for each planet and moon. Depending on how you count dwarf planets this is somewhere i nthe range of... 189 council members. Fuck me sideways,  that IS a veritable UN,  isn't it? </div>
<p></p>My fanon was similar to Badwolf's,  so it's similarly affected (mostly positively). But I think that I'm going to incorporate Kegi's. Makes things less complicated. So now,  all the races share a cosmic council of... well.... almost 200 members! (But that includes the rulers of every race. Discord would be the council member of Eris,  Chrysalis may be the one of... say Ganymede etc.)
<p></p>Also,  we can use the alicorns (other than Chaos who is specifically AU) as some members of the council.
<p></p>Also,  I see no problem with ponies and seaponies interbreeding so I see no problem with Leo and Celestia being literal cousins.
<p></p>Of course,  this means that there are <em>lots</em> of council members,  so I'm freely raiding other fanfics and fanons etc.
