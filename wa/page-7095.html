            I believe that considering episodes discontinuity because they interfere with a theory is not the way to go. One should use new information to improve,  revise,  and,  if need be,  discard the theory in favor of one that is even stronger.

            I consider it kind of absurd that you would discard whole episodes on the basis of a detail that doesn't even contradict with canonically defined setting details,  but hey. Your headcanon is your headcanon.

            But the dragons in Dragon Quest were basically only passing through. And I never saw dragons as a 'nation' in any case. They seemed like the solitary type in S1,  so I assume they were gathered to,  I dunno,  mate or share tea or whatever. The adults at least don't seem particularly concerned about anything.
<p></p>As for Mystery,  I have no opinion on the Griffins,  but aren't Mules *basically* an equine species anyway?

            <div class="quoteblock"> Course,  I could've just said "Dude,  I watch anime." But I wasn't thinking at the time. </div>
<p></p><span class="blue">Anime is just a medium,  not a genre.  There are plenty of stupid,  mindless,  anime with no deep details to pick out,  even if there are also plenty of good ones.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Anyway,  I agree that the area around Ponyville (Equestria,  but probably also the surrounding local countries) is very Pony Dominated,  and it makes perfect sense for it to be.  But I don't know if we can conclude that they dominate the whole world.  And you can declare whole episodes discontinuity for yourself if you wish,  just don't expect us to do the same.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">As for why I think it makes sense for the Ponies to be the most powerful race in the area,  first of all,  they have Celestia,  who is practically a goddess and controls the SUN,  so she could destroy all life on the planet if she felt like it.  Kind of hard for the other races to not hold her in high regard.  Then there's the fact that,  for what ever reason,  Ponies are really,  really physically powerful.  They seem nearly invulnerable,  and are remarkably strong as well.  Even in the finale,  we had a group of 6 civilians with no known combat training fighting off DOZENS enemies of an invading army.  And then there is all the magic they have available.  Pegasi control the WEATHER,  Earth Ponies are apparently the only ones who can grow crops,  and Unicorns can do just about anything if they learn the proper spells.  All in all,  Ponies are an extremely powerful race,  so it's only sensible for them to be the number one nation in their section of the world.</span>

            It probably doesn't help that episodes that interfere with my headcanon also tend to be horrible episodes for other reasons.
<p></p>I mean,  even if I were completely kosher with the idea of a Griffon and Cow-run bakery,  <em>Mystery on the Friendship Express</em> is still a stupid episode.  That it bothers me on that note is just the straw that breaks the camel's back.

            <div class="quoteblock">House of Leaves is a LOT shorter than it looks,  what with all those dozens of pages that only have a single line of text,  or just one word. Btw,  House of Leaves is my single favorite book of all time.</div>
That's why I said "if it counts". I always try to get people to read it because it really is good. I would definitely place it among my favorites,  but I've had a spot for the two Alice in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass books since I was younger. <br> <br>Have you seen/tried Only Revolutions? I picked it up for 5 bucks a while ago. It's...something. I can't tell if it's a good something or a bad something,  but it's certainly something. <br> <br>And we're done with this already. Whoops taking forever to type. Yeah,  Dragon Quest and <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMMystery" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMMystery">MM Mystery</a> are good. DQ is actually the only Spike episode I really like.

<p></p>Agreed,  but the point is you're not likely to comprehend most anime if you can't understand anything that's not spelled out for you.  Anime tends to keep things vague.  Annoyingly so,  sometimes (damn you,  <em>Go Lion</em> and not telling us whether the robot is sentient or not).
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">"Horrible"? Do you mean comparatively horrible next to the rest of the series,  or actually horrible? </div>
<p></p>Depends on the episode.  "A Friend in Deed" falls into the former,  "Dragon Quest" the latter.
<p></p>Haven't decided where some of the other eps on my Discontinuity list fall.
