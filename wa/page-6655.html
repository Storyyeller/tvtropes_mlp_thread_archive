            @ilse: That can be true,  although I'm pretty sure that in it's original form,  Eros would have referred to romantic love rather than any sort of sexual desire.  It often is sexual,  but it wouldn't necessarily have to be.  Depends on the historical context,  though.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I'm pretty sure his initial reaction was something like "Eh,  it was okay."  I don't think he actively disliked it,  but he definitely doesn't share the OMG BEST EPISODE EVAR feeling that most people got.

            @Ginger:  That's a good point,  if Celestia knew about the changelings she would have been a lot more suspicious of Twilight's claim that Cadence was acting weird.  So now I'm still wondering how they knew there was a threat on the way.  Maybe Canterlot just has a Vague Incoming Threat Detector or something.  Or Celestia has Pinkie Sense.

            Guys,  know why I'm happy too?
<p></p>We've just seen what happens if the big bad has an army of mooks...it turns out...the Mane Six get stumped...I find this very interesting.

            <div class="quoteblock">actually,  wouldn't it be less dues ex machina to use the Elements,  which are explained and set up as artifacts of massive power,  and have been used since the very beginning of the show,  versus some 'love power' that only applies randomly to two ponies and involves nearly no explanation,  coming in at the last second to win the day?</div>
<p></p>What? You thought it was love <em>itself</em> that defeated the changelings?
<p></p>No. The energy from their love,  that is,  the power of their unity (the same sort of power that destroyed the Windigos and forms the basis of the Elements of Harmony,  and which Chrysalis had <em>already used</em> to defeat Celestia),  recharged Shining Armor,  who was able to re-create the shield spell,  which flung all the Changelings out of the city.
<p></p>The power of love didn't defeat the queen. The shield spell,  which had been established,  did. Love was a glorified battery,  to risk sounding detached. It certainly didn't come out of nowhere. Unity and harmony are massive sources of energy and power. This has been seen as early as episode 2,  and was only further shown in Hearth's Warming Eve. Love is just another facet of that,  the same as any of the Elements.

            @Crow Yeah,  I swear she has a network of spies and scouts. Maybe they told her that something was coming,  they just didn't know what. and Tia was to fearful for their safety to have them check again.

            I still think that Cadence so very kindly warned Celestia of a threat to the kingdom. Perhaps even suggested that her fianceé weave his special protective bubble over the city.
<p></p>By the way,  now that Shining Armor has married Cadence,  does this make Twilight Celestia's niece?
