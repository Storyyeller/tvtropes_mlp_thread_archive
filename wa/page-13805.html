            I noticed season 3's been added to Seasonal Rot.
<p></p>''•Season 3 of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic,  while it had some good episodes,  has many,  many base breakers. So far,  the only episodes that haven't caused any heated divisions yet are "Magic Duel",  "Sleepless in Ponyville",  and "Apple Family Reunion". The biggest breaker was the finale,  on which many bronies are called the show's Shark-jumping moment. Two words: Alicorn Twilight.
◦It was also half the length of previous seasons,  and a regular criticism is that several episodes seemed rushed and seemed more suited to a two parter treatment. ("Magical Mystery Cure" and "Keep Calm and Flutter On" being the most obvious candidates)''
<p></p>Alicorn Twilight aside,  is season three really more controversial than season two? I've never read any discussions about the episodes,  but from what I've seen on various trope pages and episode recaps,  most of the problematic season three episodes seemed like they made people annoyed rather than outright pissed. We never got another Mysterious Mare do Well,  at least. Or does it only seem less controversial because there were fewer episodes?

            I don't think it's worse than Season 2,  to be honest. When you only have 13 episodes and no way to really put a story arc into it like they did Season 1 (and there was plenty of foreshadowing to Twilight becoming an alicorn,  such as Celestia telling her that after the Crystal Empire she would be ready to move on to the "next level" of her studies,  plus the book that Luna poofs in at the end.

            That's a YMMV page,  right? If so,  who cares?
<p></p>To be honest,  I've seen huge arguments over Magic Duel more than the likes of Too Many Pinkie Pies or One Bad Apple.

<p></p>Yeah,  I've pretty much given up any hope of those being anything other than heaps of whining.
<p></p>Seriously,  to read all the YMMV and DMOS bullshit,  you'd think that nobody actually liked the show.

            The only one that came close to MMDW was One Bad Apple,  and even then it still missed it by a wide margin - most people simply didn't like the handling of the moral rather than thinking it was out-and-out terrible.
<p></p>Moreover,  being divisive doesn't mean that something has succumbed to seasonal rot. In fact,  the fact that it's divisive means it <em>hasn't</em>,  because it's overall quality is clearly still up for debate.
<p></p>There have been people complaining and breaking base since Season 2 started,  this is nothing new for us. IT got big near the end due to having a whole bunch of shit happen at once,  but seriously? This is just another day in the fandom. Those who don't like it will break off,  and come season 4 all will be well with bronydom once again - at least until something else mildly unexpected that changes or affects the show at all comes up.

            Not to mention that the complaints about "One Bad Apple" were pretty fucking stupid and mostly read like people who were bummed that their childhood revenge fantasies never came to fruition.

<p></p>Depends on the page. Seasonal Rot isn't meant for personal opinions,  it's supposed to be when there's a general consensus that a particular season was worse than the others.
<p></p>Though given how devoted a lot of pony fans are,  I always thought that things would have to get really <em>really</em> bad before the majority of fans agreed on a season being lousy.

            Yeah that is just one person whining,  there is nothing about season 3 that wouldn't meaure up to any 12 episode chunck of the other seasons. They all had good an bad,  it's just with only 13 episodes,  there is less awesome. and the ONLY episode that is more or less agreed (from what I've seen) to be bad or sub par was Spike At Your Service,  the rest are a wide variance of opinions.

            Wow,  I'm surprised how Treehouse is trying to catch up. Just yesterday,  they aired two episodes at 10:30 and 4:30 each: The Crystal Empire Part 1 and Dragon Quest,  basically meaning they're premiering Season 3 while they're still premiering Season 2 episodes. Of course,  this won't be happening constantly considering how they premiere 2 Season 2 episodes each weekend,  so premieres of Season 2 episodes end next week with MMMMystery on the Friendship Express (they already aired A Canterlot Wedding in October). Of course,  not like I care,  I just thought you should know.

            I liked season 3. Not as much as season 2,  but I still liked it. For me,  it was the most consistent season so far. Least variation in how much I enjoyed the episodes.
<p></p>Might just be me though as the season with the most variation in how much I enjoyed the episodes was season 1.
