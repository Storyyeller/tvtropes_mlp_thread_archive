            I got a serious question Twilight.
<p></p>What would you say would be your three major political goals right now?
<p></p>If I were you,  consolidating your power,  planning to take control of Equestria and making the ponies under you happy would be my goals. You need the people on your side,  and the military,  but also foreign powers. Politics is a cut-throat's hobby,  so be careful.

            @Steve: At the moment my main goals are maintaining my personal relationships with both my friends and with my subjects (it's so weird thinking of other ponies as subjects now),  looking out for the wellbeing of Equestrian citizens,  and fostering healthy diplomatic relationships with other nations.  It's a tall order,  but Celestia and Luna assure me that I'll grow into the role.
<p></p>As for my brother,  he quite understandably had to resign from his position when he moved out of the country. It's kind of hard to run the national guard when you aren't in the nation you're guarding.  He's currently establishing a similar guard in the Crystal Empire.

Needless to say there's so much of it that it can be rather daunting.

            "Magic" as seen in Equestria appears to be a branch of science. Those who originally viewed Unicorn magic would have dismissed it as something that could not be explained or documented,  but both of those things have been done with it at present time,  I am assuming. The fact that it is action at a distance makes it seem impossible and sorcerous to us who don't understand it.
<p></p>However,  there are still things that need classification,  such as various forms of wild magic,  the Chaos effect,  and certain anomalous abilities,  like the Pinkie Sense.

            @Orion: Not at all.  Honestly,  getting addressed as "Princess" feels quite weird.
<p></p>@Irish: It's hard to make a direct comparison as haven't been to your world,  but from what limited information I've been able to gather,  the best way to explain magic would be like this:
<p></p>I know you have laws of physics and such,  so we'll use that as a starting point. Best I can tell,  our worlds both share the same basic laws of physics.  Such as thermodynamics and the laws of motion.  However,  your world has <em>only</em> those laws of physics,  whereas our world has (and this is only speaking the most vague of terms) a secondary set of laws of physics which exist independantly of the primary laws. The reason for this difference is that (as far as I can figure) your world has only a singular type of energy (which manifests in different ways of course,  but is always subject to the same laws).  Over here,  we would identify that set of laws as "mundane physics."   However,  our world has a second type of energy,  magic,  which has its own laws of physics which exist independantly of the first set of laws.  So whereas you simply have "Laws of physics" we have "Laws of Mundane Physics" and "Laws of Magical Physics" which govern two different types of energy,  mundane energy (what you're familiar with) and magic energy (which I study).  The laws governing these two energies very often don't line up with each other (i.e. some things are possible with mundane physics that magical physics couldn't produce,  and vice versa).  There is overlap,  of course (pegasus magic is a good example),  but we haven't yet discovered all the ways that mundane and magical physics interact.
<p></p>Then you have stuff like the Pinkie Sense,  which can't be adequately explained by either branch of physics.  We're still not sure what to make of that.

            That's just an opportunity to make observations on it and revise previous conclusions. The wonderful thing about physics is that there is always the possibility of something around the corner that could re-define everything.
<p></p>That is also the terrifying thing about physics.

            Some of us believe that magic is possible its just not known and therefore unharnassable. But that's going deep down the philosophy rabbit hold.

            Magic? there is no such thing as magic.
<p></p>Equestria has a quantum field that seems to be magic but it's actually a form of superscience.
