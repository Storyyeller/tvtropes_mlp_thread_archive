            I still maintain that that half wheel of Jarlsburg is among the best purchases I've ever made,  and that's not even my favorite kind of cheese! The thing lasted me for months. It's a real pity that cheese is one of the things that isn't cheaper in bulk,  since they sell it by weight.

            That's kinda the impression I got,  too. <em>someone</em> in this picture is spoiling her,  I think. OR maybe she's just at that age where she's starting to realize she has money and others don't,  and an ego is just coming out,  and it'll settle down once she realizes nobody really gives a damn.

            1. I managed to derail the thread into cheese again without even being here.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">  And yeah,  I just wanted to give Luna some bizarre tradition and a cheese wheel seemed like a good fit; it's seemingly pretty random and anyone would be confused if they got one,  but at the same time if you think about it enough it <em>does</em> make some sense as a present.
<p></p>2. My headcanon on DT is that her mother spoils her. Her father is aware of this and tries to counteract it,  but because of his job he's not around to discipline her as much as he should.  She's a bitch <em>now</em>,  but I could definitely believe that she'll mature out of it. She'd definitely have some reparations to make to the CMC though.

She wouldn't be happy with DT if she knew what she was doing.

            Actually,  speaking of Families that was another thing I noticed on the re-watch: Granny Smith refers to her family as the 'Smith' family,  not the Apple Family. So either she got a name-change somewhere down the line,  or she married into the Apple Family,  and they took over the orchard from there.
