<p></p>Hey guys,  been a while.
<p></p>...No episode this week. I still don't know how I'm gonna hold on until next week. At least there's a lot of fan material to help us wait xD

            I don't think that she's poorly handled,  per se.  It's just that from the get-go she had the "stereotypical farmer" obstacle to get over.  I think her character is pretty well-handled,  it's just that she looks like a stock character at first glance.  She's not,  by any means,  but you have to get past the "farmer" image before you get to the more subtle elements of characterization.  There's plenty of depth to her personality,  though.  More than anything,  I think she just got a bad introduction.

            I don't like Zecora either,  though it's mostly just cause I think her rhyming schtick is dumb.
<p></p>@Japanese Teeth:  It's not the accent that bugs me,  the accent is fine.  A little exaggerated,  but recognizable as a southern accent.  It's all the stupid little wild west phrases:  "HEAVEN'S TO BETSY!"  "WHEEW,  DOGGIE!"  "RIDE EM COWPONY!"  "I HAVE NO IMAGINATION AND JUST LIFTED A BUNCH OF LINES OUT OF A TERRIBLE OLD MOVIE,  YEEHAH!"
<p></p>@JT: Yeah,  she does have depth,  she's a good character,  its just that every time she opens her mouth I forget all that and tend to facepalm at how stupid she sounds.

The point I'm trying to make is that AJ is basically a good character that gets hidden under the "western farmer" stereotype.  The stuff you mentioned is really my only ongoing gripe about how her character is handled.  It doesn't bug me quite as much as it does you,  but I do have to shake my head sometimes and go "who <em>talks</em> like that".  Like you said,  there's a lot of depth to her character,  it's just that the over-the-top veneer distracts from it.
<p></p>And now I must go pick up my guitar from the repair shop.  I will return!

            It doesn't bother me as much as it sounds like it does.  I still like her,  and this is pretty much the first time I ever thought about <em>why</em> she's so low on my list.

            @Allik: I was still talking about AJ.  But Zecora works too.  In Zecora's case though she doesn't really have any <em>redeeming</em> features (imo),  so I don't like her at all (except in Luna Eclipsed,  she was alright then).
<p></p>@Light Phaser: You are the Castlevania guy,  right?  I was wondering something: What is it you like about the series?  Is it the platforming or the exploration of intriguing environments and large amounts of unique,  interesting enemies?

            Well,  I <em>have</em> met people who talk like Applejack. You just don't see them unless you're in the middle of nowhere,  which is where I live. They do tend to be pretty old though,  so that style of speaking will probably be gone altogether in the next generation or so.

            (looks like I got to re-post this) So what do you guys think of  Pinkie's family,  or at least her sisters,  showing up in an episode? I would love to see how they interact with each other.

            @Blue
<p></p>Yeah,  I <em>love</em> Castlevania. Why I like the series? Wellllll,  hold on,  because I'm going to explain why I love the Castlevania franchise in the Pony thread. Perfect sense,  am i rite?
<p></p>-ahem-
<p></p>Well,  to put it bluntly,  the Castlevania series strikes me as two things: brilliant,  and surreal. To be specific,  the original Castlevania games had that eerie "You are all alone; now <em>fight</em>" feel to them. Admittedly,  many games also share this type of adventure. But Castlevania (and it's sequels,  for the most part) is the only one to successfully make you feel scared. Why? Your whip has a delay! Jump once,  no retries! Grab as many hearts as possible! So,  what about the surrealism? Look at the titular castle in these games! There are staircases leading to nowhere! Floors floating above other floors! To add frosting to the cake of beauty,  there is a massive attention to detail in any given game,  even the old NES ones. As the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAngryVideoGameNerd" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAngryVideoGameNerd">nerd</a> pointed out,  you can make out a large skull in the backdrop of one level in Super Castlevania IV,  and there are even little tiny bats flying out of the holes on said skull. Some of the enemies,  although very annoying for the most part,  are very creative. Medusa heads,  hunchbacks,  living armor,  etc. The list of why I love this series goes on,  but I fear that this post is already getting mighty long and I've been preempted by several tropers already now. So,  I think I'll stop here. Big thanks to anyone who actually read all of this.

            I would love to see Pinkie's family show up,  personally,  and I'm interested to see how they'd work off one another.
<p></p>So with this hurricane fluttershy thing,  in spite of the synopsis it seems like it may well be a duo episode to me,  rather than just a straight fluttershy episode. One way or another,  I'll bet if any episode is going to include Derpy again it'll be this one.

            Here is something we can all contemplate: So what would you all be doing right now (on this site) if there had not been FIM? Some of you even be a member of TV Tropes? I do remember seeing some of you in past years-vaguely. I would myself would probably be looking at or doing something in regards to Anime,  Music,  literature,  or even little political tract if I was bored. So how about the rest of you?
