            <div class="quoteblock"> Really? What parts were below your expectations?
<p></p>Also,  any recommendations for music would be appreciated,  because I'm in a dry spell. </div>
<p></p><span class="blue">The tv tropes page seemed to make the show out to be far more serious,  arc-driven,  and mature than it actually is.  One of the things that really annoys me about this fandom actually is the group of people that constantly point stuff out about the show and go "Oh,  you thought this was a <em>kids show?</em>"  Well yeah,  guys,  it <em>is</em> a kids show.  Those people seem really insecure to me,  because it seems like they feel embarrassed for watching entertainment meant for children and rather than simply come to terms with it they try to fool themselves into believing that the show isn't <em>really</em> a kids show.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Special mention goes to Discord,  which the tropes pages makes out to be a blood-chilling,  terrifying,  horrible monster that will give you nightmares and mind-raped the mane cast into sobbing wrecks.  When in fact he was just a dopey fun trickster that had a mean streak.  Although come to think of it I don't think I'd have liked that version of Discord anyway.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">It wasn't really <em>below my expectations</em> its just that from all the talk about the show I didn't realize that there were still plenty of exceedingly corny bits that I would have to do my best to ignore.  Like I said,  I love the show,  but people <em>always</em> make out their favorite things to be better than they are.  I've tried to avoid that with both this show and Homestuck,  stressing whenever I mention them that they are not for everyone and I don't expect anyone to automatically like them.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Anyway,  here's some music I just found:</span>

            Eh,  labels are labels,  and people should choose them for themselves. I,  personally,  don't care for the term "brony",  and wouldn't call myself that. I <em>do</em> consider myself a part of the fandom that mostly do refer to themselves as such,  though. Nothing wrong with the term itself,  I just don't care for it or any sort of label like that. "Fan of [insert work here]" works just fine for me.

            @Bluespade: I'm right with you on that one.  Yeah,  the show is definitely good,  but a lot of fans take it way more seriously than it was intended to be.  And yes,  the show can be taken seriously and still stand up,  but it's kind of annoying when everyone insists on trying to make it look like a work of art when it's really just a really good kids' cartoon.
<p></p>@Ginger: The problem is that 1. people hate being labelled by others 2. The term "brony" has a lot of different meanings,  ranging from "someone who likes the show" to "someone who obsesses over the show",  and it's easy to see how someone who fits the first definition wouldn't want to be lumped in with the second definition.
