            Yeah,  the ending could've been done way better. Otherwise,  the episode was okay. If you want my opinion,  they should've either tried to drop subtle hints about Discord's desire throughout the episode,  or have him right his wrong at the Acres once he realized that Fluttershy was trying to be her friend,  then have him spend the last few minutes convincing the rest of the Mane Six that he's genuinely sorry.

            Trying to convince everyone that he's sorry would have completely ruined the episode for me. That is so far out of character that no amount of suspension of disbelief could keep me in the show.

            <span class="blue">Discord is essentially an extremely spoiled child.  He gets everything he wants whenever he wants because he can make it so.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Fluttershy's method of dealing with him was simply to bend over backwards and let him do whatever he wanted... and this somehow made him reevaluate his methods up to that point?  Why would it?  And I can't buy that their "friendship" could possibly have meant anything to him.  They hung out for less than 2 days and the entire time one or both of them were trying to manipulate each other.  That it not a friendship.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">I'm okay with the setting being a super happy friendly rainbowland where everyone has good in them,  but Discord was <em>introduced</em> as being an exception.  From the moment he appeared he was treated as a terrible threat that had to be stopped immediately,  with no playing around.  No one ever considered a peaceful solution,  Celestia told them to get the Elements and go zap him.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Now all the sudden it turns out all you need to do to make him nice is <em>ask.</em></span>
<p></p><span class="blue">This was by far the most nonsensical and illogical plot the show has ever had.  I'd like to pretend it didn't happen but I don't believe in Discontinuity so I suppose I'll have to live with it.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">I wonder if they'll even bother coming up with an excuse for why Discord doesn't defeat any further villains for them from now on?</span>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> If you want my opinion,  they should've either tried to drop subtle hints about Discord's desire throughout the episode,  or have him right his wrong at the Acres once he realized that Fluttershy was trying to be her friend,  then have him spend the last few minutes convincing the rest of the Mane Six that he's genuinely sorry. </div>
<p></p><span class="blue">He wasn't sorry though,  he just didn't want Fluttershy mad at him.</span>

            @Syd: We already knew that was going to be the case as soon as we got the synopsis.
<p></p>@Blue: I can see what you mean,  but I think of it this way: Discord isn't necessarily inherently malicious; the reason he was in his introductory episodes was because he wanted to bust the elements of harmony up and he just happened to find it amusing.  In this episode,  he basically realized that enjoying himself and not doing exactly what he wants all the time aren't two mutually exclusive options.   Basically,  his primary goal is to make himself feel good,  and in this episode he realized that he could do that while not making enemies out of everyone.
<p></p>That said,  yeah,  the two-minute long conclusion really should have been about five times longer than it was,  but I don't think it was necessarily OOC or goes against any of the show's themes up to this point.  It just didn't quite get the development that it needed to.
<p></p>I'd also point out that this might be the first time that Discord has ever experienced somebody doing something solely for his benefit without having an ulterior motive.  Even Celestia only freed him because she thought she could get something out of it.  As far as we know,  this is the only time in Discord's existence that he wasn't treated as an enemy right off the bat.  For the first time in over a thousand years,  somebody actually <em>tried</em> to like him,  and for the first time he realized that having people who like you actually feels good.  Possibly even better than just using your ultimate power to screw with everyone else and make them hate you.

            I have noticed a consistant issue with the more action-oriented episodes. In nearly all of them,  the main gripe that strikes me as being on the money is "they didn't have enough time to fully wrap things up at the end."
