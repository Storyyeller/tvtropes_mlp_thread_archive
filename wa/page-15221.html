            No Fabrication,  though. And there was the implication that Time Travel is a once-is-all-you-get deal,  so that doesn't have... any level of practicality really,  even if it <em>was</em> useful somehow.

            The fact that most real life air ducts are too small to crawl through is a sad fact of life.
<p></p>On the subject of magicing up some food,  I'm gonna assume that it just doesn't taste as good as real meals. Kind of like a TV dinner versus a well-prepared meal.

<p></p>Everypony needs food. Hardly anypony needs to get somewhere fast enough to break the sound barrier. In real life,  there is constant research into improving agricultural yield; unless the ponies are dumber than we've seen in canon,  there should be similar research in Equestria.
<p></p>Besides,  even if magic does supplant traditional agriculture against all odds,  it's not like agriculture is the only thing earth ponies are good at.

<p></p>I mean the feeling that the world has changed and you have no place in it because you have been left behind.  The feeling of drowning in a world where the things you felt were solid are just water.  The feeling that you're not wanted,  not needed; and might as well have been replaced.  That feeling.  Obsolescence.

Oh,  hush you!

Makes me wonder if it's born from having a past of neglect and/or orphandom; I understand those two factors,  if severe enough,  have a strong probability of breeding habits of seeking attention from anybody. </div>
<p></p>We've seen Rainbow's dad in a flashback. They seemed pretty happy. Also,  Lauren Faust says that she sees Rainbow's mother as Firefly,  who was her favourite pony,  so unlikely to be a bad mother.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
... Well,  why doesn't he just say that?! Honestly,  Fluttershy immediately admitted that she wanted to go solely for that fantastic garden near the gala's location. </div>

Ah,  I think I get it. Families have names,  but surnames don't exist as a concept in Pony culture,  so they're all Only One Name. </div>
<p></p>That fits what we've seen. Except some ponies like Twilight Sparkle and Rainbow Dash for example,  have two word names.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Butting heads is a game. In the most genuine situations,  those attacks and humiliations are harmless jabs. The people involved know each other well enough to understand that they are not genuine attacks. Not only that,  it's an excellent way to air out petty grievances while they are still petty,  instead of letting them foster.
<p></p>It's also a demonstration of trust. The difference between a genuine attack and play is the intention behind it. You can accept ribbing and hard truths from someone you care about that,  if it came from anybody else,  would be fighting words because you trust their intentions and their judgement. </div>
<p></p>This.
<p></p>On uncorns conjuring food: My headcanon is that unicorn magic is like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a> magic in that it can't create nutrition.

<p></p>Actually when you consider how RD acts,  how Lauren said she would not make a good sister,  and how she apparently took "Fire Fly's brain and put it in Rainbow Dash" that doesn't bode well for her as a mother.

I count those as cases of "one name,  two words",  with the avoidance of combining the two words into one word being a matter of aesthetics (Twilightsparkle and Rainbowdash just look <em>ridiculous</em>!).

            <div class="quoteblock">Ah,  I think I get it. Families have names,  but surnames don't exist as a concept in Pony culture,  so they're all Only One Name.</div>
<p></p>Yeah,  theme-naming seems to take the place of surnames,  for the most part.  Twilight <em>Sparkle's</em> brother,  for example,  is named <em>Shining</em> Armor.  I have a Headcanon that Pinkie works at Sugar Cube Corner because the Pies and the Cakes are distant cousins.
<p></p>Oh yeah,  and I tend to pop in and out of the forums pretty abruptly.  I frequently check/post on the forums during 5- or 10-minute breaks from work.  So if I don't respond,  I'm probably not ignoring you,  I just needed to get back to work.
<p></p>EDIT: For awhile,  I actually had a hypothesis that only Earth Ponies used surnames,  while Pegasi and Unicorns used theme naming.  This was mainly based upon the Pies and the Cakes,  with the addendum that AJ's immediate family all go by nicknames (and <em>hate</em> being called by their full names).  That Headcanon seems to have been Jossed,  though.

            @Hsere: It depends on how canonical you consider the supplemental material. A side books has revealed the Sister's names to be Limestone Pie and Marble Pie. And their mother is something-or-other Pie. So it's not really word of anyone,  considering it's official material.
