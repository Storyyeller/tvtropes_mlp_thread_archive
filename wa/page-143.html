<p></p>I agree that Pinkie's parties seemed less exciting this week,  but that's probably due to the lack of background ponies milling about.

            So,  time for some major philosophy up in here:
<p></p>Is Pinkie Pie a comic relief character?

            So while waiting for the epiosde to re-air so I could watch it ON TV,  I came up with these:
<p></p><strong>Alternate Endings for "Party of One!"</strong>
<p></p><strong>Ending 1</strong>
<p></p>"Tell me that my friendshaveallbeenlyingtomeandavoidingmebecauseth- eydontlikemypartiesandtheyDONTWANNABEMYFRIENDSANY- MORE!!!"
<p></p>Pinkie Pie huffed in a rage,  waiting for Spike's reply.
<p></p>But suddenly something licked her ears.  She looked,  and there was Twilight Sparkle with a coy smile.
<p></p>"Oh,  is <em>that</em> what you thought this was about?"  Then,  shooting a "this is serious,  obey me" look at Spike,  she said "Spike,  leave,  and be SURE you lock the door."
<p></p>"Where will I go?"  the baby dragon asked.
<p></p>"Go find Rarity and hang out with her until I call you."
<p></p>Spike stood up and saluted,  "Yes SIR!"  and immediately left and locked the door.
<p></p>Pinkie Pie watched all this,  and her anger was replaced with a subtle fear,  especially when Twilight again shot her that coy smile.
<p></p>"Actually, " Twilight said,  "You couldn't have it more wrong.  We like you.  Actually..." Twilight put her arm around Pinkie,  "Some of us like you more than others.  Like me.  I've been wanting to get you alone for a <em>loooong</em> time..."
<p></p>Pinkie Pie gulped,  and the scene faded out.
<p></p><strong>Ending 2</strong>
<p></p>"Yeah!"  Applejack said,  "Construction work!  That's my story and I'm sticking to it!"
<p></p>Pinkie Pie stared her down,  but Applejack held firm.  Then,  in a low voice,  Pinkie Pie said "Okie Dokie Lokie..." and slowly withdrew.
<p></p>Applejack sighed,  and SUDDENLY PINKIE PIE JUMPED THROUGH THE OPENING and pinned Applejack to the ground with a triumphant "HA!  And now,  let's see what kind of 'construction'—"
<p></p>Pinkie Pie's voice caught in her throat as she looked around.  All her friends were there,  trying (and failing,  miserably) to cover up the wall-to-wall stacks of boxes she saw.  Boxes which said things like "Manhunt 3" or "Mortal Kombat 55 and a Fifth:  Unrated Banned in Australia Version."  On the other side of the barn was a horde of gold coins that could almost have come from a dragon's horde.
<p></p>Suddenly Applejack rolled and the tables were turned:  Now it was Pinkie Pie who was pinned.
<p></p>"I didn't want to have to do this,  sugarcube,  but now you know our awful secret—"
<p></p>"No,  no I don't!  I don't know that you've been secretly making tons of money by smuggling banned games into Australia and selling them at mark-up prices!  What am I,  Sherlock Holmes?  I could never be that smart!"
<p></p>Applejack's eyes narrowed.  "Sorry sugar,  but there's only two ways out of this.  We have to make sure you'll never,  <em>ever</em> talk.  So cross yer heart,  hope to fly,  stick a cupcake in your eye.  Because if you ever breath a word of this to <em>anyone</em> on the outside,  that's exactly what's gonna happen.  The crossin' will be done with a cattle brand,  the flyin' will be done without a safety net,  and the cupcake will be made of <em>cinammon</em>!  You ever stuck cinammon in your eye,  sugarcube?  HAVE YA?"
<p></p>Pinkie Pie was shuddering too hard to give a straight answer.
<p></p>"Ummm, " Twilight said,  "I think we've made our point."
<p></p>"Reckon I agree!"  Applejack said,  and let Pinkie Pie up and suddenly becoming her cheerful self,  "Sorry we couldn't attend yer party,  but hey,  no hard feelings,  right?"
<p></p>"Righty-O!"  Pinkie Pie got up and waved cheerily,  and then left,  having promptly forgotten everything that went on inside the barn.
<p></p><strong>Ending 3</strong>
<p></p>Pinkie Pie had been brazenly talking to her turnips and rocks,  celebrating Gummy's after-birthday party with just herself and her "new friends, " when suddenly the doorbell rang.
<p></p>"Now who could that be?"  Pinkie Pie wondered,  and then the door opened.
<p></p>Rainbow Dash swooped in,  shut the door behind her and panted heavily.  She was scared for her life.
<p></p>"What do <em>you</em> want?"  Pinkie Pie asked in an obviously unfriendly tone.
<p></p>"There's no time!"  Rainbow Dash was at her side in an instant.  "We've gotta run!"
<p></p>"<em>I'm</em> not going <em>anywhere!</em>"  Pinkie Pie said,  indignantly resisting,  even moreso when she saw Rainbow Dash was trying to lead her out a window.
<p></p>"Yes you <em>are!</em>"  Rainbow Dash began trying to push Pinkie Pie out the window,  leading to the whole sitting-on-her-head bit and Rainbow Dash subsequently flying into a sack of flour.  She was at Pinkie's side again in a moment,  and said "Oh you wanna do this the hard way?  We'll do this the hard way!"
<p></p>And she blackjacked Pinkie Pie into unconsciousness.
<p></p>When she woke up,  she was in a dark back room and couldn't see where she was.  Oddly,  her hooves were tied and her mouth was gagged shut.  And she heard whispering.
<p></p>"Is that it,  then?"  It sounded like Rarity's voice,  "are they... <em>gone?</em>"
<p></p>"Yes, " that sounded like Twilight Sparkle.  "I think we can let her out now."  and then the door opened.  Pinkie Pie now saw she had been hidden in one of Rarity's closets.  The unicorns undid her bindings and Twilight said "Well,  that's over,  the danger has passed."
<p></p>"Danger?"  Pinkie Pie asked,  "what danger?"
<p></p>"Is it safe to tell her now?"  Rarity asked.
<p></p>"I think so, " Twilight answered,  then said to Pinkie Pie,  "Pinkie,  last week the Council For Deciding This Stuff voted you the cutest cartoon character in all recorded history.  The cast of <em>Azumanga Daioh</em> didn't take this very well and came for your blood.  We knew that if you knew,  you'd want to try to talk this out or sing a song or something else that would put you out in the open.  So we had to make defense preparations without you knowing."
<p></p>Rainbow Dash,  who had just walked in the room and looked like she just got back from a battlefield,  said "Yeah,  that's why I was in such a hurry when I came to your house.  <em>They knew where you lived.</em>  Sorry about the whole knocking you out thing,  but it was either a little bit of brain damage or your life,  and I thought the trade-off was worth it."
<p></p>"Love what you did with your hair,  by the way, " Rarity finally commented.
<p></p>Pinkie Pie looked at her friends,  and asked "So... where are Applejack and Fluttershy?"
<p></p>Elsewhere,  on the outskirts of Ponyville:
<p></p>"Hey,  Fishies, " Fluttershy talked into a river,  "I've got something new for you today.  I don't know if its good,  but if you don't like it,  please find someone who will.  Thanks."
<p></p>And she tossed a human arm into the river before leading the cart-bearing Applejack to the next feeding ground.
<p></p><hr>
<p></p>So,  whaddya guys think of those ones?

            Episode also kind of highlighted another of Pinkie's flaws that got mentioned in this very thread.
<p></p>Poor Communication.
<p></p>But otherwise,  those moments right before she throws the "party with her friends" and right after she pressures Spike into escalating her fears was a pretty sad one.
