            It probably would shift shape depending on whatever would be scariest in the situation. At the end when it gets defeated it might just smoke away without actually revealing a true form.

            I'd think of him as a Black Knight-styled stallion,  with red eyes and covered in armor. At one point,  his armor would be torn off,  revealing his skin to be similar to that of a zombie.

            Yeah,  like with Fluttershy we've seen she's scared of the whole many eyes laughing at her thing. Or maybe a dragon. Which she's worked to overcome hence why she might be the one to overcome it fastest,  she's had to face her fears the most.
<p></p>I'd say the Elements beam peel away shapes it's taken to scare ponies until nothing remains,  without fear it has no substance.
<p></p>And like I said before I think to prevent it's defeat it would throw the Mane Six into vision of their failure to dissuade them from even trying.

<p></p>Maybe it has one constant (like a glowing red eye) among all it's forms and all that's left at the end is that eye and Purple smoke surrounding it.

            Now I'm thinking of a backstory for it. Like there's a land of dreams. and all horrible experiences and broken dreams get sent to the furthest corner of it. Then one day a pony somehow travelled to the realm of dreams,  but ended up becoming bonded to the mass body and soul,  making it sapient. Creating bad dreams <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            Remember how Discord seemed to specifically hated Celestia? What if this one specifically hated Luna? Night is the domain of dreams after all it would make sense that she'd have taken the lead in dealing with it in the past.
<p></p>Could also tie into her issues. Everyone thanked Celestia for saving them and the only one who remembers Luna's role on par with Celestia's was the fear monster itself.

            @Bad I actually think this thing predates the sisters. Not quite as old as time,  because I like to think it has the soul of a pony at it's core <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
