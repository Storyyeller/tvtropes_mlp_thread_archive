            Syd: Over 3000 are the one-of-a-kind novelty ones like the 49" Dashie.  If you look hard enough,  there's people willing to make pretty good looking ones for 200-300.  500-600 will net you a main six from White Dove,  although she always has a bit of a queue.  There's also Pony Plushies,  which do bulk from a custom pattern for 85 (the catch is the bulk part makes their stock have a rotation of availability,  and they only do two of the main six at a time).  Not the best out there,  but still quality.

            Hi people!
<p></p>Do you think Celestia have changed? I mean,  a thousand years ago,  she turned Discord into stone and banished Luna to the moon. This time she got softened and tries to reform villains and such. Kind of "Celestia from New Testament".

            Nah I'm sure she'd still do the old stuff. If Luna didn't reform I don't doubt it that Celestia would send her back to the moon. If Discord didn't reform he was going to be a statue again. I figure she's pretty much the same.
<p></p>Edit: She even gambled the wellbeing of the Mane Six and the Crystal Empire just to teach Twilight a lesson.

<p></p>But they have a chance of doing a flashback episode showing a "hardboiled Celestia" and how she become more "human" along the past 1000 years... because of loneliness.

            @Bad You sure? I mean,  just look at Luna. Her social skills were in stasis for 1000 years,  and when she came back she was doing everything that she <em>knew</em> royalty was supposed to do back before she was banished. Presumably,  Celestia would have had a similar public persona back then.

            My sister and I once made a plushie for our mother back when we were young. It wasn't the most symmetrical thing,  but it was functional. Of course,  it was a rabbit and pretty flat.
<p></p>@EDIT: We know that the sisters have changed a lot. They don't even lookl the same. And yeah,  Luna was acting as was expected of her in her time. Honestly,  I think that Celestia was still an adolescent when she banished Luna.

            It's really open to interpretation because there's hardly any evidence one way or the other.
<p></p>I do like to think that,  when Nightmare Moon first showed up,  Celestia wanted to redeem her from the get-go,  but didn't have enough power to purify NMM while wielding all the Elements of Harmony herself. Banishing NMM was purely a plan B. Even then,  "After 1000 years,  the stars will aid in her escape" was a deliberate part of Celestia's spell‚Äîthe entire banishment was a long gambit on Celestia's part to find new Element-Bearers and redeem her sister.

            @ Lurker: I'm not saying she'd have the same persona. I'm saying I think she's still keeping the same line. If Luna didn't reform I don't she'd sit there and say,  "Welp tried my best here's Equestria". She'd try and send her to the moon or whatever. If Discord didn't reform he was going immediately back to a statue.

            Making some of the custom plushies definitely takes talent. I'm not sure if I have the coordination for it,  and I would certainly need to know a lot more than I do now,  given that I don't even know how to knit.

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">My guess is that since most ponies don't do the types of labor modern horses do,  they wouldn't need iron shoes. Especially since those are only necessary if the horses will be constantly riding over hard or rocky ground,  which isn't the case in Equestria most of the time. </div>
<p></p>I'd be surprised if the Apples didn't use them,  and I could see it being a thing for drifters and adventurers ‚Äî at the very least,  those carrying a decent amount of gear.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">What's weird is that they are never shown wearing horseshoes,  but they do leave hoofprints shaped like horseshoes.</div>
<p></p>While it's probably Coconut Effect,  it's not that far out of the question anyway.  A normal unshod hoof looks like <a class="urllink" href="http://www.miniaturesforu.com/hoofinfo.jpg">this.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>‚óä</small>  Unless the horse is heavy enough (and ponies are a good deal smaller) or the ground soft enough to press the entire hoof in,  an outer wall imprint will still look vaguely like horseshoes.
<p></p>As for Celestia,  my favorite interpretation is the one from Ambassador's Son: that Celestia used to be a stereotypical ruler,  but thinks Nightmare Moon happened because she personally overdid it (and might be correct,  though it's never elaborated).  Her current propriety and approachability comes from guilt over that,  and over time resulted in a surprisingly recent golden age in Equestria.

            It just occurred to me,  if you could go and touch a pony's coat,  would it be like a normal horse's? I mean would it be a bit soft and stiff like a normal horse,  or more fur like? Also,  would a pegasus have softer and lighter coats? Ignoring the fact they shouldn't be able to fly in real life,  they could have a hollow bone structure similar to birds with featherlike hair to help get themselves off the ground. Eh,  I'm taking this too scientifically,  they're magical multicolored talking ponies.

            Well,  the size of a pegasi's wings isn't even really enough for them to glide,  let alone fly,  and they're far too resilient to be hollow-boned(That said,  Dash remains the only pony we've seen thus far to have any real injuries - Twilight's wheelchair doesn't count because she was out of it inside a day). Personally I think they just use magic to fly. Whether or not that would affect their fur... I mean in theory,  once you're i nthe air you still have to take into account aerodynamics. Perhaps they would be be-plumaged. Beyond that,  I can't see any reason why a pony's coat would be any different from a horses... except perhaps for the use of coat-care products changing it. I dunno,  do real horses ever get a good shampooing?
