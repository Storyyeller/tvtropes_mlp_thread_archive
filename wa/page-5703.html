            @Story Yeah,  it redirects you to random wiki pages made for each home page variation,  so when you refresh is simply refreshes that new URL instead of the original one that redirected you. I know some PHP wizardry that could set it up to randomize on every refresh,  it's not even that complicated,  either. It might have required more restructuring of their current scripts than they were willing to make,  though,  so that's probably why they didn't do it.

            Well,  hello everyone. Sorry about the bad day Mousa. I worked at a veterinary clinic for a while and let me tell you,  at least you don't have to deal with telling customers their pets died. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">It was a very uplifting experience to say the least</a> &gt;_&gt;
<p></p>Sorry I left for a while,  I somehow fell asleep while using the computer. Somehow. Did I miss anything? And yeah,  Rarity is in my Top 3 of the Mane 6. I just don't really dislike any ponies really. And Pinkie went up on my list just by that one "Addict" scene. It was so funny. I actually kind of felt bad for her... <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

I don't think she has a very "southern" tone. I think it's more of the accent. If she didn't have an accent,  it would not be a Texan thing at all. Plus,  I've worked in farms and I have to say... that's basically my life XD

            Redneck isn't a southern stereotype,  it's a rural stereotype. Believe me when I say that when you live in the middle of nowhere in a place that has a lot of farmers and trailer parks,  <em>lots</em> of people talk like that. As far as stereotypical accents go,  the redneck deal is spot on.

            Wow. I'm in one of the subdivisions off of 170. There's a bunch of them over here,  the area's really developing. There's a McDonald's and a Kroger being built right outside my neighborhood.

            Cows do smell. But they're cute. But cows always seem to get mad at me and want to head-butt me. I don't have the same issue with horses. Although that might be cause I have a little bit more experience with horses. Goats and sheep are really easy to handle though,  once you get the hang of it. Pigs are smart but incredibly stubborn,  so moving them is hard. They tend to be really sweet though.
<p></p>I always have issues with birds though... I guess I'm just not a bird person &gt;_&gt;
<p></p>Wait,  are we supposed to be talking about ponies?
<p></p>And good night Story ^^

            Pigs smell even worse. There's a pig farm close to the town I grew up in,  I remember sometimes being able to smell it even when it was out of sight.

            Ha ha,  big farms always smell. I have experience in more private settings,  where there are only a few animals and everyone is constantly cleaning up their... leavings (that is,  rodeos and the like). I love all animals.
<p></p>And Mousa,  if you're still here,  I like it when guys are direct and just talk about random stuff. It gets awkward when you talk a lot and she says very little though. It might be a better idea to just listen instead of talk. Just give good commentary ^^
