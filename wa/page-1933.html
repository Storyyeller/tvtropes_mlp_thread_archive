            Hello guys, 
<p></p>Sorry to interrupt the discussion but I was wondering if anyone would be interested in critiquing the first part of this story that I wrote.
<p></p>If you're interested,  please send me a PM and I'll send you the link later on.

            We actually have a <a class="urllink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=13092259580A88860100&amp;page=157#3912">thread for fics<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  Dingo. Throw it up there,  I'm sure a few of us would be more than happy to look at it!
<p></p>@Bagofmagicfood,  last page: I watched the episode... it was poorly paced,  clumsily written,  the voice acting was dull and lackluster,  the song at the end was uninspired and the whole thing was just sort of saccharin. The conflict was barely there,  and there wasn't nearly enough time to build up enough emotional tension for the climax to feel good at all. The colours were dull and ugly,  and the animation was awkward and sloppy.
<p></p>And yet... I actually sort of really enjoyed it. It's years before my time,  so it can't be nostalgia,  but there's something to be said for the sort of simple earnestness. I can really see why MLP became such a hit in the 80's. For all it's faults,  it's actually got a lot of life behind it. Compared to G3 and 3.5,  which are pretty but empty,  it's actually really nice.
<p></p>The plot itself? Pretty close to what I was thinking,  except showing off the race's talents except for just having a knack for being in the right place at the right time. But it might be interesting to try adapting an old episode into the modern setting,  in fic format.
<p></p>(also I was disappointed that Sweet Stuff wasn't deep blue with electric pink hair and didn't hang out in a club flirting with the bouncer)

            So!
<p></p>Sweet and Elite tomorrow morning. Who wants to take bets on what we'll see?
<p></p>Personally,  I'm hoping for a new one-shot character. I'm also betting on it being an actually difficult decision - as in,  the Canterlot ponies aren't dicks.
<p></p>It's also more a hope than a real bet,  but I'd like to see Rarity <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> - stay in ponyville,  but keep in touch with her Canterlot contacts. I'm still hoping the contacts refer to career contacts,  so I have to hope it goes well for her.
<p></p>Also; who do you think will take her leaving the worst? I'm guessing between Fluttershy and AJ.

I like how she looks as an adult in this drawing; suits her well,  no? By the way,  what does most of the fanbase actually think she is going to grow up to be? It's implied her talent is in the way of coordination and balance,  however that can be applied,  but a lot of people like to imagine her being a member of the wonderbolts. Which do more people think she will wind up being? The racer or whatever else (the other popular theory is either dancing or scooting/extreme sports,  take your pic). I say......why can't she do both?<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_wink.png" height="16" width="16" alt="wink" title="wink">

Pinkie and RD on the other hand........have they ever actually had any on screen personal interaction? Her saying they need to go cheer on RD doesn't count; I mean personal interaction.

            I may have a convert!
<p></p>Maybe.
<p></p>I went with some friends to see the new Muppets movie (it's awesome),  and during the scene where Kermit talks to Martin about talents,  I mutter quietly "Someone should totally tell the CMC that" and the guy sitting next to me,  who gave me a ride there and back,  was like "oh,  yeah?" because he didn't hear me clearly. But I thought he actually <em>was</em> a brony,  so I intended to confront him about it in private.
<p></p>When he did,  though,  he said he just didn't hear me clearly,  and so I repeated what I'd said. He was confused as to what it meant,  and in the interest of <span class="cinnamon">Honesty</span>,  I told him that I liked MLP,  using a reference point from even earlier that night (he had <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twilight" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twilight">Twilight</a> as an audiobook in his car,  and he said he was giving it a try to see what all the fuss was about. (I told him that "I knew the feeling. But not for Twilight<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u> <div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> <sup>No,  I did not mention the pony commonly known as Twilight</sup> </div></span>.)) And he was like "oh,  okay" and then using a <em>different</em> reference point (a local sandwich shop,  in which someone had drawn Fluttershy on a paper bag,  then hung it on the wall<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>+</u> <div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> <sup>If you can name the shop,  kudos!</sup> </div></span>),  we got to talking about the ponified movie trailers and such,  and then I expounded upon some other aspects of the show (again,  mostly Fluttershy - I specifically mention her scenes from Lesson Zero and her soft scream in Green Isn't Your Color),  and after I somehow manage to pull off the back-and-forth from the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpen" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpen">Cold Open</a> of Sonic Rainboom,  I summarize:
<p></p><ul><li>The first two episodes of both seasons are very different from the rest of show. Not necessarily better or worse,  just different.
</li><li>Don't start with Art of the Dress (and then I talk a little about Rarity,  without saying her name).
</li></ul><p></p>Anything I could have done better?

It's the CMC as very ugly scrawny humans with a really creepy old man,  is that supposed to be Discord?
<p></p>Here's a stinger:
<p></p>If Discord is a Transvestite then is it biologically male or female?

            Why is it that whenever we get actual,  dedicated trolls (as opposed to dilettantes that spam incoherent nonsense and bestiality accusations in a dozen threads simultaneously),  they focus on Discord?

            Nah,  you know if Discord ever met a troll he would act completely polite and civil,  just to mess with them.
<p></p>I doubt Discord likes the idea of being adulated. Sort of ruins the whole 'chaos and torment' schtick,  doesn't it?
