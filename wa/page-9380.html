            You know,  I've just been thinking,  that if the episodes were ordered differently,  I'd probably have liked Rarity a lot more. For a long time,  I had a <em>very</em> low opinion of her. There was a time that I considered her <em>worst pony</em>! Then Suited for Success happened. Now I love her! But our relationship suffered due to me disliking her for so long.
<p></p>Do any of you have something like that?

            <div class="quoteblock">Sorry,  I don't see it. Her introduction,  SOTC,  OAB,  TBNE,  all show her to be over the top and 'odd' <strong>to most ponyfolk.</strong> </div>
<p></p>See,  that's an important point.  In Season One it was seen that her behavior often got a reaction from other ponies,  and often not a favorable one.  Rainbow Dash avoided her,  Twilight told her to stop shouting,  the ponies at the Gala basically told her to stuff it,  the buffalo <em>freaking try to kill her</em>,  and so on and so forth.
<p></p>The only Season 2 ep I recall her being called out in is Mmmystery,  even though she had been a perfect little git in several previous episodes (Tormenting Luna and Cranky is just for starters).

            I consider Suited For Success and Sweet And Elite to be REALLY overated.
<p></p>People call them the episodes that made them love Rarity.
<p></p>... it didn't effect my opinion of her at all. I always liked her,  from the very beginning.
<p></p>No single episode has COMPLETELY altered my character preferences. It just isn't the sort of thing that happens with me

            Except her tormenting of Luna and Cranky <em>did</em> get reactions.
<p></p>EDIT: I'm not a massive Sweet and Elite fan. It's good,  bt Rarity episodes are <em>always</em> good. I need something <em>incredible</em> to impress me in a Rarity episode.
<p></p>Suited for Success and Green isn't Your Colour are my two favourite season 1 episodes. They really got me to understand why Rarity is such a great pony.

Same here. A bunch of episodes together maybe,  but a single one never has that big of a reaction.

            I can fully understand why folks would not be impressed with Pinkie in AFID.  But I can never dislike her,  because her intentions are usually good.  Her goal in life is to make ponies smile.
<p></p>@ Moe
<p></p>Erm,  the Cakes reluctance to let her babysit?  Twi joining Facebook?
<p></p>Ponies still recognise pinkies problems in season two.

            Well... I used to love the Cutie Mark Crusaders,  but now I'm kind of sick of them.
<p></p>Though really,  no episode has ever really make me love or hate a character.  I'm too much of a "big picture" thinker so often one single story isn't gonna change much.  A gradual progression over time though is a different matter.
<p></p>Pinkie and Fluttershy used to be my Best Ponies.  Then it became Dash and Rare... then Twi and AJ.  I think now its morphing into either Twi and Dash,  or Dash and AJ,  or perhaps I'm gonna have three best ponies now.

            I liked Rarity from start.  She was on 6 place on mane cast but I love all them so it's not that bad.
<p></p>I really liked episodes like Suted For Success (despite having premise sounding uninteresting) but haven change my opinion about her.

<p></p>Blue: While PYHD was largely about 'Shy's anger and acting cruelly,  I'm referring more the to point close to the end where she's able to advocate for herself/assert herself in a more positive manner while avoiding being cruel.

<p></p>Yeah—she got called a genius and completely absolved of all wrongdoing.

            @Ginger: The thing is,  you assumed that Rarity <em>was</em> a good pony. I <em>didn't</em>. I considered her a designated protagonist. It doesn't help that Rarity and I wouldn't get along in real life. We're too different. So when I saw how selfless Rarity truly was,  it really touched me and made me reconsider my values.
