            Pretty sure Rainbow Dash would be a fairly good captain. She's got experience leading the weather patrol,  which outside of LBYS is I believe consistently doing a good job. She leads a third of the ponies in Winter Wrap Up (the third that was the most effective). She managed to lead the entire pegasus population of Ponyville in Hurricane Fluttershy. Spitfire made her the lead pony at the end of Wonderbolt Academy so she clearly sees potential.

            I'm gonna guess BT is some kind of bank. They can be bastards about that sort of thing,  Apple. It doesn't necessarily mean your identity has been nicked,  you might have just accidentally signed on with them in the fine print of some other contract.

            I'm not sure what Gilda's theme music necessarily sounds like,  but I thought of a villain song for her that could be to the tune of Jingle Bells and could be played in a heavy metal style:
<p></p><ul><li>Gilda rules/Gilda rules/Griffons all the way!/Oh what fun it is to kick those losers in the hay!
</li></ul><p></p>And then for bonus points,  she sings this while booting ponies out of the way and kicking them into haystacks.  That's just what I thought of off the top of my head when imagining the idea of Gilda having a villain song.  Or something about bragging about how cool she is and how lame those Ponyville losers are.
<p></p>I just thought of something else about Gilda.  What if she met Trixie?

            @storyyeller: Thanks!  Jingle Bells probably wouldn't necessarily fit Gilda as much unless it was a winter-themed episode,  but it's also a song that is often used in making mocking parodies (like the infamous "Jingle bells,  Batman smells" version) so it could also fit for that reason.  It was just the first thing that I thought of.  Glad you liked it! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">
<p></p>@Sereg: About Gilda being an element of Harmony,  I could probably see her either being Laughter or Honesty.  Laughter because she likes to play pranks,  although in a more malicious way than Pinkie does.  Honesty because unless I'm remembering her wrong,  she seemed pretty bluntly honest about her opinions and wasn't afraid to say what she thought of others,  even if it was insulting.  Her actually representing one of the elements of Harmony would require her to do some <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and gain more of the positive aspects of Laughter and/or Honesty as well.
<p></p>A verse of "Gilda Rules" I just made up:
<p></p>With Dashie through the snow/it is an awesome day/over the fields we go/laughing all the way!  Through the clouds we zing,  as we fly through the sky/What fun it is to be so cool and make those losers cry!

            I don't think Honesty would fit Gilda. She must have been very deceptive to fool Dash for years.
<p></p>Laughter would suit her quite well,  though. I wonder,  does laughing <em>at</em> others instead of <em>with</em> them exclude you from being the Element of Laughter?
