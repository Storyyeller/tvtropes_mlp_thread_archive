Well,  who wants something so bad they'd be willing to put their lives at stake for it?
<p></p>My first guess would be Rainbow Dash (impress the Wonderbolts,  get into the team),  followed by Rarity (become poplar,  particularly in Canterlot).

            Well,  you know how we have playing cards for games like poker and all that today? Welll,  originally,  it was a French(?) game using a set of cards called the Tarot.
<p></p>In addition to the standard four suits (which were Wands,  Cups,  Swords,  and Pentacles instead of Clubs,  Hearts,  Spades,  and Diamonds) which made up the Minor Arcana,  there were also 22 trump cards,  called the Major Arcana,  which had titles like The Fool,  The Emperor,  Strength,  Death,  etc.
<p></p>Eventually,  the cards started to be used as a thing that could be used to read fortunes. The meanings given to each of the cards are pretty interesting,  and I find it fun to see if I can find matching things in shows and stuff.

            Tarrot cards were playing cards before they were used for fotune telling.
<p></p>I agree that there is a significant difference in age between Celestia and Luna,  whatever significant is for them. In My Little Alicorn (an excellent fanfic),  it's implied to be millions of years,  possibly even a billion. Of course,  Celetia and Luna had pretty sucky pasts in that fanfic.

            Okay,  I'm not going to be able to finish all of Episode 9 before heading off to my next class,  so my comments will be split a bit. Also,  I have a <em>bad</em> feeling about what'll happen to Kyoko this or next episode...
<p></p>Still want to find out Homura's wish,  and what Madoka's will be...

            @Red I thought Kuubey's ability to grant wishes stems from the inner power of the girl who's becoming a magi.
<p></p>Also,  would he really grant your wish if you said "I wish you and the rest of your species were incapable of interacting with this world and anyone in it in any way shape or form"
