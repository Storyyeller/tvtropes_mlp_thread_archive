        <div class="post-content">
            Hey guys,  I wanted to ask for some help. You see,  I'm one of the longtime members of the Fluffybooru site,  home of the offshoot-from-MLP-<a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a> Fluffy Pony fandom. Since the fandom has grown with content lately,  I'd like to open up a page for it here on TV Tropes,  so that people don't have to fish through the pages and pages of small references that the search engine bring up. I'm not sure which section to put it in beyond "Web Original",  and I'd appreciate it if anyone here could maybe give me some pointers on where to start.
<p></p>Now,  I realize that Fluffy Ponies has an admittedly deserved negative reputation. However,  if you don't mind,  I'd like to explain the history of Fluffy Ponies from someone who has been there since almost the beginning:
<p></p>Well,  like a lot of things that are at least partly horrible,  fluffy ponies got their start on 4chan in an /mlp/ thread. There was a greentext story about MLP ponies being brought to Earth and lobotomized so that they could be remade into household pets for humans. The story focused in particular on a depiction of Sweetie Belle as a lobotomized "pet" pony,  with possibly fluffier fur added to increase her appeal. This is the first part of fluffy ponies' origin,  which generally isn't that well known.
<p></p>At around the same time,  Mixermike622 came up with Fluffle Puff,  who as you all may be aware is a rather silly pony who is also incredibly fluffy. Most commonly,  this is the origin that people know about: Mixermike622's Fluffle Puff and what came after.
<p></p>Anyway,  the two ideas coalesced on 4chan and took off,  with fluffy ponies becoming extra fluffy miniature ponies with Sweetie-Belle-style mentalities,  sold by Hasbro as part of their MLP toy line. They quickly became parodies of the fact that quite often,  Hasbro MLP toys have almost nothing to do with the original MLP cartoon series and properties. (Not so much anymore now that they are intentionally trying to make the toy lines more show-accurate,  but you get the idea.) So for example,  they became rather accident-prone,  often dying in (literally) comical ways,  one particular stable being "Fluffy + Something with Water = Fluffy Pony Drowned". Generally,  this was played for legitimate (black) comedy,  with nothing malicious meant behind it.
<p></p>This being 4chan though,  the literal asshole of the internet (pardon the French),  it wasn't long before some 4chaners decided that they wanted to explore stories and art featuring fluffy ponies going through drawn-out deaths,  maximizing the suffering and mental anguish the fluffy ponies went through before dying for their own enjoyment. To justify such abuse though,  they began coming up with reasons why the fluffy ponies deserved it; they literally were walking fecal matter factories,  they were selfish and cruel to each other,  they were bratty and disobedient (in this case meaning one case of childish stubbornness or a tantrum from an otherwise perfect fluffy would warrant torture and abuse the likes of which would make a Guantanamo Bay guard vomit in disgust),  they were worthless and had no purpose,  etc. None of these things had existed beforehand mind you,  they were just invented to justify the extended abuse and torture 4chaners would put the fluffy ponies through.
<p></p>As you can imagine,  Mixermike622 was not pleased by this development whatsoever. For a time,  he even left the MLP fandom because he hated the fact that something he had helped create with Fluffle Puff,  Fluffy Ponies,  had turned into Saw-style torture gorn. Eventually he returned,  but not without firmly entrenching Fluffle Puff as a solid resident of MLP:<a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a>’s Equestria,  and thus not generally like or associated with the Earth-based 4chan Fluffy Ponies.
<p></p>Nowadays,  with the move from 4chan to its own booru,  Fluffybooru,  Fluffy Ponies have developed considerably from when they were on 4chan. While the abuse is still there,  there is often a backlash of content that balances it out. This non-abuse content ranges from "hugbox",  which is simply sweet and innocent pictures and stories of fluffy ponies (which coincidentally is what most people who aren’t familiar with the abuse side think of when they think of fluffy ponies(( and which is now represented by the safe for work site,  Fwuffyboowu <a class="urllink" href="http://fwuffy.booru.org/index.php?page=post&amp;s=list">http://fwuffy.booru.org/index.php?page=post&amp;s=list<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> featuring exclusively only safe for work material),  to what I call the "Mrs. Brisby and the Rats of NIMH/Watership Down/The Animals of Farthing Forest" genre: Essentially extended,  multi-segment or chapter stories featuring fluffies trying to make it and survive in the world,  coping with the fact that they are literally on the bottom of the food-chain in the world around them. These stories focus more on ferals or strays,  fluffy ponies who either were abandoned by their human owners or who have for generations lived on their own without human "daddies" and "mommies" to care for them (as they were originally intended to be by their creator company,  <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasBio" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasBio">Has Bio</a>).
<p></p>After almost two years now,  that background has lead to a large variety of stories,  artwork and comics. A particular event that occurred about a year ago,  titled "The Fall of Cleveland" in particular is the community's current masterwork,  being a multi-month-long collaboration between several of the (actually) competent and creative members of the community detailing the creation of a theme park catered explicitly to Fluffies called "Spaghettiland" in Cleveland,  which wild Fluffy Ponies from around the US think of as their very own "promised land".
<p></p>True,  there are quite a few members of the Fluffy Pony community who would make yukkuri-torturers proud. But there are just as many,  if not more,  of us who do NOT condone fluffy torture,  and there is a particular focus in the community on creating quality fiction,  even if it is grimdark in nature. Because of that,  I want to set up a page for Fluffy Ponies here,  but before I can do so,  I'd really appreciate it if any of you could tell me which section of the site it would be best to put in.
<p></p>Thank you for your time in going through this and giving me the chance to speak. Thank you also for whatever help you can provide.
<p></p>

            I'm sure we have a section for MLP fanworks. That may be your best option if someone can point you in that direction (I'm not really deep into fanworks myself).
<p></p>And...I honestly wasn't aware this was such a thing. It's been eons since I've seen fluffy pony abuse or anything outside of Fluffle Puff.

Question is,  should I do it under image boards,  just for fun,  other,  or what? If any mod could give any advice,  it would be greatly appreciated. Part of my goal for this is to,  among other things,  create character pages for the more notable,  multi-story/image characters that the community has developed over the past two years:
<p></p>Whitefluff - a literal giant of a fluffy,  easily the size of a large St. Bernard dog if not larger. A fluffy version of One Piece's Whitebeard. He leads his giant herd of fluffies,  acting as a "daddy" for them to fill the need for a "daddy" and "mommy" that all fluffies feel.
Howler - A mutant fluffy,  pure black fur with white mane and tail and one scared eye. Easily as big as Whitefluff,  with carnivore fangs rather than herbivore molars. Hunts down and kills fluffies that abuse and hurt other fluffies for their own selfish fun. While not much is known of him,  there is the theory that he was part of a batch of Fluffies designed to be talking,  giant guard dogs.
<p></p>Martini - A green-furred and dark-green mane and tailed unicorn fluffy,  his series is one of the more Grey and Gray morality series. Martini's story revolves around his being used as a breeder stallion,  first by a abusive owner he calls THE SCOTT,  then his second and permanent owner,  whom he calls Big Man. Very recently as of this post his series came to an end with his death by old age.
<p></p>Princess Sparkle - A running gag earth pony fluffy who is mind-boggingly spoiled and self-entitled. Part of the original batch of fluffy ponies ever sold,  she becomes separated from her owner and goes through a fifteen-year long odyssey to get back home that would make Ulysses himself weep. Has had her own Distant Finale where she finally makes it back home,  but can still appear in other's stories provided they are set during her odyssey.
<p></p>Maroon - A blood-red unicorn supremacist fluffy pony who rules an abandoned skating rink with his unicorn herd,  who capture and keep earth and pegasi fluffies as their slaves. Basically one of the most evil fluffies in the fandom.
<p></p>To be honest,  part of the reason why I want to try and make this page is to both get more exposure for fluffy ponies and hopefully begin to phase out the Depending On The Writer nature towards the "canon" of the fandom. Right now,  practically anything goes as it all is dependent on what one particular fan's "headcanon" is,  but I'm hoping that an influx of new blood (that isn't in lust with the yukkuri-style abuse part of the current fandom has) will help stabilize things more. (For example,  Princess Sparkle died at the age of 15 at the end of her odyssey. Martini died at 6. Both apparently from old age. And that's just one of the many discrepancies in the fandom.)
<p></p>That,  and right now Fluffies are written as exclusively being on a version or different versions of human-inhabited Earth. I'd like to see more Fluffle-Puff,  Equestria-centric Fluffy Ponies come about as well.
