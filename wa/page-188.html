            I have teory that Celestria escaped madness and tyranical stage because of trolling.
Thanks to trolling she can deal with immortality,  frends going forever,  sister being turned evil,   istead turning to the Dark Side or showing god wrath she just troll somepony and stess go away.
It's a way of troll,  perhaps if Luna started trolling 1000 years ago she could avoid turning into Nightmare Moon.

            Just start from the beginning,  but watch a couple of episodes before making up your mind. The two part pilot is good,  but not really representative of the series as a whole. The character-driven stand-alone episodes that make up most of the season are generally held to be an improvement.
<p></p>Some fans favor the idea of getting people into it by pointing them to some outstanding episodes first off (since the order doesn't really matter),  but I don't really see the point in that. You could try episodes 7,  9 or 11 if you wanted to do that though.

            Cutie Mark Chronicles is probably not a very good introduction episode,  partly because it helps if you already know the characters,  and partly because it's,  well... "Cutie Mark."

            While Trollestia is pretty much canon,  keep in mind that it's also harmless,  playful trolling. Far as I can tell,  nothing she's done has any kind of negative impact on anyones life beyond the immediate joke,  and in some cases it all works out for the best.
<p></p>Also,  bringing up her appearance at the Grand Galloping Gala,  anyone else notice how not only is Celestia looking like her own normal appearance,  but that Twilight and pals are the best-dressed individuals there? Is there anypony present that's dressed up in anything close to what Rarity put together for them?

            Well Rarity is best desingner and those dresser are her best work.
And Celestria don't need any dress she is God Prencess,  her crown is only thing what she need.
<p></p>For start I recomend Feeling Pinkie Keen,  it have mostly slapstic and action (later with Hydra).
Also Dragonshy,  it have Dragon,  Death Glare,  alusion to A Team and LOTR.

^ I missed the LOTR reference. What was it?
<p></p>How about The Ticketmaster for an introduction? It's one of my favorites.

            Might work - some viewers aren't as fond of it as others,  though.
<p></p>Also,  someone posted on Ponychan about a "rant" video he made,  complaining about the pony fans. Nobody agreed with him.

            Personally,  I don't think The Cutie Mark Chronicles is a very good starter episode,  since a lot of its entertainment value come from the cool little callbacks (<a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallForwards" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallForwards">Call Forwards</a>?) and references. Overall,  I do think the pilot can be a good starter,  but there's always the danger of people,  especially men,  judging the show too early. In that case,  I'd recommend Swarm of the Century,  Sonic Rainboom,  or <em>maybe</em> Fall Weather Friends. I love Dragonshy,  and it'd probably work okay as a starter,  but I feel the ending is more awesome if the viewer's gotten to see more of Fluttershy's... well,  shy nature.
<p></p>On that note,  I finally was able to convince one of my friends (that I mentioned <em>waaaaaay</em> earlier in this thread) who refused to watch past the first episode to watch Sonic Rainboom. It seemed like he enjoyed it,  but still can't get over the fact that it's My Little Pony. Oh well,  I tried. Maybe his resolve will weaken at some point,  but either way,  at least he was good enough to give it a shot. Besides,  I still have that <em>other</em> friend who hasn't watched a single one yet...
<p></p>Changing the subject a bit,  I'm trying my hand at writing some episode-style fics,  but as I'm a sucker for <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalFlavor" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalFlavor">Original Flavor</a>,  I want to make sure I get the character voices down. Do any of the main ponies have any set nicknames they use for the other members of the mane cast? For example,  I know Applejack uses "sugarcube" a lot,  and IIRC she sometimes calls Twilight "Twi, " but I can't even remember how frequency she uses that one. I don't <em>remember</em> the show's writers having any consistent name usage,  but I wanted to make sure. Having only watched through the series once,  I don't nearly have the knowledge of the series that I usually do while I'm writing.

            Good starter episodes are "Applebuck Season, " "Swarm of the Century" and maybe "A Bird in the Hoof."
<p></p>I tried to get someone started with "Party of One, " it didn't work out too well—she enjoyed it,  but yes it wasn't as hilarious for her as it was for me because she didn't know these characters well beforehand.

            "Fall Weather Friends" was my starter,  and I found it kind of blah. The next episode hooked me,  though (I am not suggesting "Suited For Success" is a universally-good starter,  though).
