            Actually,  I wasn't fond of Sweetie Belle<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">'s singing. I thought she sounded different than before,  to the point where I wondered whether it wasn't someone other than Michelle Creber voicing her there. I suppose it could have just been Creber's voice shifting naturally though.</span>

            @Ginger:  <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">  But the whole point of that musical number is that Scootaloo is terrible at singing.  Yeah they had the actress give a terrible performance,  but the character was legitimately bad at it.  That isn't going to suddenly change,  and it isn't a mark against her.  She just isn't good at singing.  I actually think its cute how bad she is at it.</span>

            @Crow <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You aren't getting me. I KNOW that she was supposed to be bad at singing. I'd love it if she was bad in this ep too. Scoot's singing capabilities aren't what I'm debating here. It's that I asked about Scoot's singing and you derailed it into talking about Sweetie Belle's. It's like whenever I talk about Schneizel in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CodeGeass" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a> and people derail into talking about Lelouch</span>

I didn't mean to derail your question,  its just that Scoots doesn't really sing much,  so there wasn't much to say about that.  It's supposed to be a good song after all,  so throwing in a few random off lines by Scootaloo would have been weird.</span>

            Okay,  just woke up,  avoided spoilers,  Rarity/Elusive is t3h evil,  I'm not sure I can wait.... I mean why do we <em>need</em> to wait? It's not morally wrong to watch it early because iTunes screwed up,  right? Right? RIGHT?!
<p></p>I'll wait... If Kegisak and Ginger can do it then I damn well can! I think.... Distraction distraction....
<p></p>So yeah,  is it just me or has this season had an abundance of guest ponies? Flim and Flam,  Cherry Jubilee,  Fancy Pants,  Daring Do and all those medical staff,  Pound and Pumpkin,  and soon Iron Will and Cranky?
<p></p>@Ginger,  that's different because Lelouch is the mother lovin' MAIN CHARACTER.
