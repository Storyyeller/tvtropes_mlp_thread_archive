            An episode that at least has the Royal Sisters as side parts would be good enough for me.
<p></p>Celestia needs some more screentime,  definitely.  There's more to Her than meets the eye.  There's an opportunity to make Her a complex character,  and I'd like to think that the writers they have on the show can pull that off well.

            I'd like a glimpse under the Princessy mask,  just enough to see what she's like when everypony's not genuflecting to her,  yet retain enough secrets about her to keep her an interesting mystery.

A look,  a tone of voice,  a pose.  It doesn't have to be much.  We sort of expect Princess Luna to be up-and-down,  She's the emotional one.
<p></p>And it's already been established that Princess Celestia has more emotions besides "serene".

            Celestia always struck me as (ironically) the colder of the two sisters.
<p></p>She's manipulative,  cunning,  intelligent. I guess that's why I prefer her. Out of both sisters she always felt like the one most likely to pull off a "I did what I had too" moment.

She's clearly capable of being stern,  so it just makes me think that almost EVERYTHING is going according to her plan otherwise <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

<p></p>Yeah,  Luna strikes me as being a tad less mature.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I see it more like a strange contrast. Celestria can be warm,  but gets harsh when she's furious. Luna is cool/colder,  but she can be surprisingly reasonable even when angry,  although she tries hard not to lose her cool these days in case she has a relapse.

            Cold is the wrong word... "Distant" is what I'm going for. Celestia seems less in touch with her subjects than Luna is. She's just generically pleasant to them,  rather than trying to make a personal connection to them
<p></p>and THAT'S what I love about her. How does a person like that think? Someone who's genuinely good,  but who's also on such a higher plane than her subjects (both intellect wise, power wise,  and position wise) that she can't quite relate to them like her sis can.

            Well,  even Luna has trouble relating but yeah,  not to the degree that Celestia has.
<p></p>Hmmm,  I need a ponified horse image.  Something imposing and borderline threatening,  but with just the right facial expression to suggest that he's not a real threat.
<p></p>Oooo,  Maximus from Tangled.  That might work.  Just need to simplify him a bit...

            In an odd way I think the Nightmare Moon thing might have helped Luna relate to her subjects. Everypony knows that Luna isn't flawless,  that she's made mistakes and in comparison to Celestia,  who is in the eyes of everypony perfect and never makes mistakes,  Luna might actually be a lot more approachable to the common folk.

<p></p>Do you plan to stick with the same smooth lines that the ponies have?  Or are they becoming more realistic looking?
<p></p>If it was up to me,  I simply make a typical male look like Mac doubled in size,  and his face 'grew' longer.  A more defined facial bone structure (like the Princesses and Fleur) could also make them look powerful and threatening.
<p></p>Same cutsey eyes and mane styles though.

            There's also the fact that Luna's the only one who's ever taken an active interest in her subjects. Celestia sees them as something to protect and she obviously wants them to be happy (in fact I think seeing her subjects happy is the only way Celestia can enjoy herself anymore outside of being with her Sister/other immortal beings) but she's never been in a position to WANT anything from them (on a personal level) They worship her as their ruler,  and they always have. Luna on the other hand,  wanted to earn their love. She NEEDED to become more familiar with her subjects in order to achieve this personal goal.
<p></p>She's also more accessable because she's more fallable. Celestia has never done anything wrong,  wheras Luna has. She can connect with her subjects more personally because of that. They see both her good qualities,  and her bad qualities.

            No,  I think the manes would be more horse-like,  thinner and along their neck as opposed to atop their heads.  Longer face,  more realistic lines - sort of how Celestia is drawn a bit more realistically in comparison to other ponies,  a Horse would be a bit more realistic than that.
<p></p>But not real-like.  It still needs to look like it fits in the show.

            OK,  I'm using this image again:

<p></p>Now I know that's a miniature horse,  not a pony,  but it seems like it would be around the same size as an Equestrian pony.
<p></p>So a horse would just tower over them,  and their face would be as long as a pony is tall.  Also,  that means that a horse could eat the apples straight out of the trees in Equestria.

            Actually,  that makes me think.  A horse's face would look <em>really</em> weird to a pony.  As in "a human meeting the missing link weird."

            People prefer Luna because she's more like an ordinary person (I thinkthat's the mane reason anyway),  but that's actually why I like her LESS than Celestia.

            Yeah,  it would have to be cartoonified or something.  But consider how Celestia is rendered,  She looks quite a bit different than a typical pony.
