            It also seems like something Celestia would do.  She's definitely not a fan of the fact that there's a wall between herself and her subjects,  and upon discovering another alicorn she'd probably try to make sure that they weren't subject to that.

            @JT & Mio: Still,  this only goes furthur as to what I thought the first time i saw Cadance. I just figure if you represent a character to the plot of UBER IMPORTANCE,  at least give her some role in the family besides "Bride/princess to be". This also makes me wonder how the fuck Blueblood is related to Celestia if Luna has never had a husband before then.

            It's also possible that Cadence only became Twi's foalsitter <em>after</em> she was accepted as Celestia's protoge,  and Celestia wanted to sort of 'keep it in the family',  as it were. Basically,  she knew that Twilight had the potential to ascend as well,  so set out trying to give her a good relationship with somepony who would be her equal,  so they'd be able to grow into the role together,  rather than under the tutelage of somepony who,  no matter what,  is going to be a bit intimidating.

<p></p>I can't remember,  did the Crystal Heart require a member of the royal line to activate the spell? Or was it that Cadence's talent was enough to get it to work.

            Blueblood was originally supposed to be a Duke,  but Hasbro made them change it under the reasoning that kids wouldn't get what a Duke is.
<p></p>After that,  he was said to be very,  very distantly related.

            Dark: The spell requires somepony to already have ascended. Then that pony needs to find her special way of activating the spell. It's kind of like Cutie Mark Mk2.
<p></p>King: Well,  Celly adopting Cadance has shown that adoption is a thing. So if Celly or Luna didn't have foals of their own,  maybe they adopted sometime in the distant past and Blueblood happens to be a descendant of said adopted pony. I guess this doesn't make them related in the traditional sense,  but IMO,  family is family,  adopted or not.

            For what it's worth,  <em>The Elements of Harmony</em> guidebook's description of Princess Cadance does mention that "She is the former apprentice of Princess Celestia,  who practically adopted her as a niece."
<p></p>As far as how Shining Armor and Cadance got together,  we'll be seeing that in <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicIDW" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicIDW">My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic IDW</a></em> Issues #11-12.

            @Kegisak: When Cadance was shown foalsitting Twilight,  did Twi have her cutie mark yet?
<p></p>Also,  my headcanon for Blueblood is that he <em>isn't</em> actually related to Celestia.  He's a noble because he's descended from Princess Platinum.  It explains why the "nobility" are all unicorns; only the unicorns had genealogical ruling structure.  The <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs">E Ps</a> had elected officials,  and the Pegasi had a military structure,  neither of which passes authority within a family.  As a result,  their authority was absorbed into Equestria's government,  while the unicorn nobility existed separately.
