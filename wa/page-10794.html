            They show up together in several episodes. I think it's the pet ship of one of the animators.

Might be others,  but those are the ones I can remember.

            That's because there's literally nothing to know about it. They don't even really have any fanon attached to them. It's just one of those "oh,  they were talking that one time,  must be an item" deals.

            There are a number of group shots where Lyra can be seen in the background grinning at the camera and jumping up and down.

            @marston We don't know if that was intentional,  either. The one we <em>know</em> was intentional was in Putting Your Hoof Down,  with Lyra and Bon Bon having a little background scene together,  complete with Bon Bon wearing saddlebags with Lyra's cutie mark on the clip.

            ok given the new series is pretty much made aruning gag out of how much running the Doctor and his compnions do,  have "A pony runs by" BE the Doctor,  when Hasbro's already officialy admitted via his name that they know of the connection,  and he was called Doctor Whooves by the crew long before that..... really don't see it NOT being intentional.
<p></p>And no more so then any other pair in that shot,  but given they were on tehre own in the middle a bridge,  easy to pick out with no other ponies around......

            Dredging up topic from 2 pages back: for me at least,  I enjoy shipping as a way explore the characterizations more. I usually approach it as less of a "OMG X and Y are so cute together therefore they are OTP!" and more of "I wonder what would take to get X and Y into a romantic relationship and what would happen if they did".  So I can say that I ship AJ and Twilight,  but it's primarily because I find it really interesting to think about what circumstances would have to arise for them to get into a relationship (while remaining in character,  of course) and how they would act once they were in one.  That's the main reason I don't really care much about Background Pony ships; there isn't really any established character to play with.
<p></p>@Perpetual: For Lyra and Bon Bon at least,  we know for a fact that the animators are aware of their popularity and intentionally pair them up; the reason I find the Dr/Derpy connection tenuous is that there aren't any other cases where they've been seen interacting (that I can remember,  anyway) so it seems less likely to be intentional.

            I just have a pet peeve for people taking speculation as indisputable fact. It may be <em>likely</em>,  but usually with intentional references we have <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word Of God</a> on the intent,  so without it we can't know for sure. For example,  the bit with Dr. Hooves wearing a tie and turning the hourglass was confirmed to be intentional.

It's sort of halfway between intentional and not in the sense that they might not do it specifically for the purpose of nodding to the fans,  but they're aware that the fans like that pairing.  Like with Derpy; they might not create a scene with "Okay time for a fandom nod" in mind,  but I think they realize that if they put Derpy in somewhere,  the fans will pick her out of the crowd,  even if she isn't actually doing anything.
<p></p>@Pykrete: They really need to make a video game with those models.
