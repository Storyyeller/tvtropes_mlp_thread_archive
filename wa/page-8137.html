<p></p>1st thought: They really named an asteroid after Dionysus?
<p></p>2nd thought: <em>Wow</em>,  that's an odd shape.

            @Sereg I don't see why Alicorns have to associated with celestial bodies. I personally feel that Celestia and Luna represent the concepts of Day and Night,  rather than the Sun and Moon specifically.

            Read the newest chapter of CRISIS. It was awesome.
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Though,  things don't look good for AJ. Think about it,  RD overcame her seed of Discord by realizing that Gray had manipulated her. Once she tells them that,  that the Mean 6 were probably trying to manipulate them the whole time,  then that MIGHT help things a little. but from AJ's perspective,  Curacao HASN'T been manipulating her. All of Curacao's heavy manipulation was done while she was in the form of Rarity. (and possibly others) Curacao has gone to PAINSTAKING lengths to keep the extent of her shapeshifting powers from the Mane cast. AJ will continue to be dishonest about Flathoof because she thinks it'll cause her friends to think she's an incestuous hick. and in the event that that notion turns out to be false,  then the blame for the whole debacle (from AJ's perspective) won't trace back to Curacao,  but to Rarity. She'll blame Rarity,  Rarity will not know what she's talking about,  and AJ will think her friends are lying to her</span>

            Seems like kind of a gip,  too. Celestia gets the sun,  I'd feel a little disappointed if all I got was a dinky asteroid. <br> <br>Korra's not exactly new. We've known about it for a while and it premiered two months ago online. <br> <br>Crisis stuff. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Well,  if she shoots back as lightning,  the reaction should be interesting. I think it'd be interesting if Curacao came back as Rainbow beforehand and tried to fool them. When the real Rainbow came back,  they'd finally understand Curacao's powers and the problem ginger mentioned would possibly be taken care of. Of course,  more drama is likely to happen instead,  so his idea seems more likely.</span>
