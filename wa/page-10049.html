            I'm okay with CMC episodes if they incorporate the mane cast into them more,  like they did in Stare Master.  What I don't want is more episodes like Family Appreciation Day,  where the mane cast is almost entirely absent.  Not that I don't like the CMC,  but on the whole I find the character interactions in the CMC episodes to be not as interesting as the ones in the mane cast.
<p></p>Also,  for the pagetopper,  <a class="urllink" href="http://i1251.photobucket.com/albums/hh553/JapaneseTeeth/Snapbucket/9F397515.jpg">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small> finally came in today.  Woohooo!  The official toy hasn't even been released yet,  has it?

            I agree with ATC. The CMC's hogged way too much spotlight in season two. Combined with the mediocre Spike episodes,  this got really annoying. And it doesn't help that their's one particular CMC episode that I really don't like either.

            The cutie Mark Crusaders just seem like OC fanfictions to me.  Spike has been an essential member of the Mane cast from the beginning,  and giving him more development leads to more interaction with the rest of the Mane Cast,  and thus,  more Mane Cast character interaction,  which I like.
<p></p>More focus on the Cutie Mark Crusaders probably means more independence from the Mane Cast,  which I,  in the words of the internet,  do not want.

I feel like the CMC are mostly interchangeable.  They do have slightly different themes,  but for the most part I feel like you could swap their dialogue around without changing much.  It would help if they had set roles within the group.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">That's exactly why I would want more episodes involving interaction between the CMC and everyone else.  Stuff like Sisterhooves Social.

            I like the Crusaders. Stare Master (this one is arguably more of a Fluttershy episode though) and Family Appreciation Day are some of my favourite episodes.
<p></p>And I agree with Lurker. They're part of the mane cast now.

            I really liked the CMC episode where we found out how the Mane 6 all earned their cutie marks.  I do prefer them more when they are interacting with the Mane 6 rather than running about on their own though.
<p></p>Not saying that episodes like Ponyville Confidential were bad,  just not as much my thing. Hearts and Hooves day was great though ... even though they only ran into Twilight in that episode..
<p></p>I guess its hit or miss with the CMC for me.  I totally hated em at first.

            @JT Except that they <em>are</em> part of the mane cast. If it's not a problem that half the cast is absent from episodes like Putting Your Hoof Down,  then episodes like Hearts and Hooves Day where only Twilight appears and only for 30 seconds at that shouldn't be a problem. The only real problem with them,  IMO is Scootaloo's lack of development.

Sisterhooves Social,  Cutie Pox,  Family Appreciation Day,  Hearts and Hooves Day,  and Ponyville Confidential. Five episodes doesn't really seem like "hogging the spotlight" to me.

            @Perpetual: I really don't think they're developed enough yet for main character status.  Like I said,  my main issue is that I don't think they're personalities are differentiated enough.  With the mane six,  swapping dialogue or roles in the plot would be really difficult most of the time.  With the CMC,  it generally wouldn't cause much trouble because they tend to all act similarly to each other.  I'm not against giving them more screentime,  I just think they're generally more interesting when their interaction isn't limited to their group.

            The CMC had more screen time in season two than Applejack.
<p></p>Adding three new characters to the Mane Seven would spread out the focus of the show too far.  Giving everypony equal and due focus would divide up the show more than would work.
