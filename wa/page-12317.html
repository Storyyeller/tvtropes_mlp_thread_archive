<p></p>I'm sure that they could use thunderclouds to store energy,  the problem is that they're probably so inefficient that using magical batteries is easier/safer.  Cloud power is probably viable,  but it would have to be in someplace like Cloudsdale with a steady supply.

            Just finished it.  Two things bugged me:
<p></p>1) Babs couldn't seem to decide on an accent. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>2) Cartoons on the whole seem very reluctant to come out and clearly admit that sometimes bullies <em>don't</em> have an excuse and really are just sociopathic cocks,  even if they portray such characters.
<p></p>Like,  Babs's deal was obvious from the start — her nervousness before DT &amp; SS showed up and her incongruous behavior after was clear.  Girl had understandable issues,  and that got treated tastefully,  as was the message that they really should've talked to Sane Pony from the beginning.  But the CMC's retaliation was played off as a bad thing specifically because Babs happened to have a sob story they found out at the last second — but what would've been the message if DT &amp; SS hijacked the float instead?  Would it have been mildly excessive at worst?

            well it was less "oh it's bad becuase she had issues" then the CMC realized the whole Cycle of Abuse thing,  Babs was bullying them becuase she in turn was bullied,  and now the CMC were turning into bullies becuase of being bullied,  they saw they were going down the same path Babs did and knew how it felt from the other side so felt horrible putting another pony through that,  given how bad it made them feel.

            @Pykrete I think DT & SS's very existence and lack of repentance is testament to the fact that not all bullies have a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>.

But again,  if it was the other two,  I doubt there would've been that kind of realization and remorse — it would've been too karmically cathartic both for the CMC and the audience to see uppance come for those two.

            @Pykrete: For my own part,  I'd still consider it excessive behavior against DT and SS,  although I'm very much a Turn the Other cheek sort of guy to begin with.
<p></p>But given that the moral of the episode was,  in a way,  'Someone having been cruel to you does not justify your being cruel to them or others',  I would say that yeah,  the show would <em>still</em> treat it as bad.
<p></p>Think of it this way: If this person is simply a cock for being a cock's sake,  do you <em>really</em> want to bring yourself down to their level? <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim">If you bully them you'll be just like them</a>.

I mean,  these girls walk all over their entire class with impunity and <em>almost no repercussions</em>.  This episode had a wrap-up message and nice way out specifically because Babs wasn't really their kind of slime.

            @Pykerte: Considering that despite having been bullied longer by DT & SS that they never thought to do something that extreme I'm not sure if they would have just let it happen to them.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">The CMC actions would have brought about pretty severe consequences if they let it happen. If anyone in the float got hurt they,  would likely be facing severe (and well deserved) punishment from the adults. If their plan had gone off as intended they still likely would have faced an escalation of the bullying afterwards.

            esspcially since DT and SS seem to be much more passive about their bullying,  just taking the opurtunity to make fun and tease them when they could,  but not going out of their way to do so.
<p></p>Where as Babs hounded them,  went after them actively,  and actually physically assaulted them or their things. It pushed the CMC further then they would otherwise go with just the way DT and SS acted,  and showed them how SOME  ponies can be driven to act like that.
<p></p>Point is they never would have set up something like that for DT and SS and if they had the show would have clearly made it clear they were very VERY in the wrong for that,  even more so then becuase of babs

            Welp. Wasn't able to catch the new episode live,  so now I'm catching the HD version on youtube.
<p></p>I need to go into this with the proper attitude. If my expectations are too high,  I'll just get disappointed. Instead,  I'm expecting that this episode will be so terrible that it causes me to retroactively hate every prior episode,  and fills me with shame that I ever called myself a fan.
<p></p>Alright,  here goes.

            Applejack doesn't have time for this crap.
<p></p>...And,  without even trying to,  I paused it on a frame of Scootaloo with a hilarious walleyed grin on her face.
