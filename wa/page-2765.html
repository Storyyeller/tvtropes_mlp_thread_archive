            I wouldn't be bothered by it so much if it weren't so,  well,  common,  in fanfiction. It's almost silly,  but I have more statistical qualms with it than moral problems. In real life,  homosexual relationships are in the vast minority,  but as soon as fanfiction takes a look at anything,  suddenly homosexual relationships equal or outnumber heterosexual ones. It's not realistic,  and it just bugs me. I have absolutely no problems with them in realistic contexts though,  so I'm probably just being petty.

            @Perpetual Lurker:  There's a simple reason for that though.  People are interested in the unusual,  so the fact that its in the minority makes it more intriguing.  Most people in real life aren't heroes or devious villains,  either,  but pretty much all fiction centers around such people.  Fiction isn't meant to be realistic.

            I got called gay (and much worse) all through my school years.  And I'm straight.  I sometimes wonder if some of the people who feel the need to gay-bash might be insecure about their <em>own</em> sexuality,  in some way.  I just pity gay-bashers for their stupidity. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">

            @Lurker: That's true in an actual population,  but you can't really look at a collection of fan writing and say that it violates statistical probability.  That's like saying that it's entirely unbelievable how many Heroes of Destiny come out of the fantasy section.
<p></p>^^It should attract all people who try to do right by people,  regardless of their religious beliefs or lack thereof. =)

            I'm talking more about within specific stories than stories in general. I might just be miffed at a particular story I was more or less enjoying ended up having 3-4 homosexual ships in it compared to the one hetero one,  in addition to playing just about every shock value card in the book. I probably just need to read more,  but shipping fics in general don't interest me so I'll probably never have a proper reference pool.

            ^^Well,  shipping in terms of background ponies is largely lesbian-centered,  just because of the massively skewed sex ratios in terms of recognizable and returning characters (Lyra and Bonbon come to mind,  but I couldn't tell you where I've seen Blues or Caramel more than once,  and some of the other stallions are just as elusive).  Not saying it's right,  but I can see where it has its genesis.
<p></p>I actually lampshaded it in a short fic I wrote - Twilight muses on why there are so many lesbian couples that they outnumber both gay male couples and heterosexual couples combined.

<p></p>I figure they hid under their beds until it was all over.  That is,  if they didn't immediately faint. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            I would imagine that the general reality warping would have flipped their personalities or at least made them more silly. What if they ended up as swashbuckling adventurers for the duration of Discord's reign? That would be hilarious.

            Speaking of the Flower Trio,  I was just re-watching their very first appearance (the bunny stampede in "Applebuck Season") and... their voices change.  In the <em>same damn scene.</em>  Seriously,  listen to the red-haired one when she says "the horror,  the horror!" and then scant seconds later when she says "every last flower,  devoured!"
<p></p>Obviously these girls have six different sets of vocal chords.  Probably evolved Pokemon-style from all that screaming.
