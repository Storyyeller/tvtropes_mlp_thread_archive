            I like how they make it ambiguous as to whether or not Derpy is actually "special",  or if she's just not too focused on situations,  or if she just likes to troll with people.

            @Kyler Three things I've seen people notice the most:
<p></p>1) AJ running away is going a bit overboard.
<p></p>2)The rest of the mane 6 push her too hard to talk,  resorting to weaponizing Pinkie.
<p></p>3) Some people don't care for the way Derpy is voiced/portrayed.
<p></p>I don't really mind any of those,  so It's definitely up near the top of favorite episodes for me.

            Well that was nice episode.  Nice to see that Pinkie is actually considered annoying even by her friends.  She seriously would not shut up this episode,  but I liked it anyway.  Although she had one good gag: giving the mail pony some cake for his birthday was pretty sweet.
<p></p>Derpy was kind of annoying,  I think they dragged her scene on too long.  Her voice is kind of weird too,  doesn't sound natural.  But it's clear now that,  for better or worse,  the production crew has embraced the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a>.  I'm surprised the name 'Derpy' got by the executives though.  Then again it's pretty much internet slang so they likely wouldn't even recognize it.
<p></p>Have to admit I saw Applejack's problem coming way ahead of time,  but it was nice not actually KNOWING what was gonna happen ahead of time for once (I've been spoilered on almost every other episode).
<p></p>So how did Ginger handle it?  At the very least,  she got to see the show admit that Pinkie is annoying.

            I had some issue with Derpy's (I still don't care for that name,  but what can I do) portrayal.  To me there was nothing ambiguous about it.  She's dumb as a post.  I realise this lines up with some fandom portrayals,  but doesn't sit well with me.  Anyway,  that's neither here nor there.  I've no intention of getting into a cyclical spiral over how she was portrayed as she wasn't meant to be the focus of the episode.

            She hasn't been portrayed as really <em>anything</em> - except for by the fandom. At the very least this is enough that we can still call her clutzy rather than dumb. It just bugs me a little that everyone <em>knows</em> where the bulk of the fandom is going to go with this.

            I like to think she's just a bit of a klutz,  with the consequences exaggerated by the cartoony nature of the show. She certainly <em>seems</em> coherent enough at least,  in terms of speech.
