<div class="quoteblock">@Moe:*sigh* I'm probably going to regret this,  but since when? </div>
<p></p>Since day one.  Its as I've said before,  "every episode plays by its own rules."
<p></p>Just off the top of my head:  Dragon aging/maturity has been portrayed differently between episodes,  the level of technology keeps changing,  we don't really know how cutie marks work or what causes you to get one,  Pinkie Sense coming and going...  If I were to sit down and marathon I could probably write a nitpicker's guide to pony inconsistencies,  but I don't see much reason to.
<p></p>Therefore,  Ponies don't poop even if some episodes say they do.

            he only episode that really feels out of continuity with the rest is MMDW,  the rest are all pretty damn consistant,  sure a few minor thing may alter,  but even then,  nothing that can't be explained as either natural change,  or us just not getting complelte information at first,  just because some pony SAYS something doesn't mean it's 100% true,  they could be mistaken,  or just not have all the right info.
<p></p>but yeah given the rather large amount of continuity between episodes,  is far FAR greater then any inconsistencies,  again MMDW aside,  seems pretty clear that's not right.

<p></p>Well basically,  if the way Dragon-maturity as evidenced in "Secret of my Excess" is how it works,  then "Dragonshy" and "Dragon Quest" shouldn't be possible,  or at least shouldn't play out the same way.  Why aren't those teenagers just mindless horders?

            @Moe Nothing in the show has directly contradicted itself. Just because dragons <em>can</em> rapidly mature with excessive greed doesn't mean that they always do. Just because they show some technology in no way means that anything previously shown was contradicted. Cutie Marks haven't changed in concept <em>at all</em> since their introduction, so I don't even know what you're complaining about here. This show is probably one of the most internally consistent episodic cartoons I've ever seen.

            I imagine the mindlessness was caused by hormonal imbalance from unnatural growth spurts. If he'd grown normally,  he would not have become a greedy mindless beast.

            @ Ed and your assuming that is ALL ther is to dragon maturity,  it could just be one facet,  we don't KNOW 100% of everything about dragons becuase the ponies don't know. not having all the information =/= contradictory information.
<p></p>issue is to many poeple are so used to shows that sit you down and spoonfeed you every single peice of info compleltly and un missably because they Assume <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">Viewers Are Morons</a>,  that it becomes hard to realize when that ISN'T in effect and they are actually being subtle and realistic in the amount of knowledge known.
<p></p>We know what the ponies know,  that is all. We have yet to see anything contradictory that couldn't be due to lack of completle information in the first place.

            You're caling greed growth a contradiction? No. A contradiction would be if they said that greed growth doesn't happen in another episode.
<p></p>It sounds more like your "contradictions" are just stuff you don't like.
<p></p>EDIT: Have to agree with the others. We <em>know</em> that there's more than one way to grow a dragon as we've seen Twilight do it herself. That's not contradiction. That's complexity. Which is a <em>good</em> thing.
