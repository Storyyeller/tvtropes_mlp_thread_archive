            I wouldn't worry too much about party balance. So long as you're in character and having fun,  the GM should be able to make your party work. Remember that the GM's goal isn't to win,  but to lose in the most fun way possible.

Start with a basic concept and grow your character from there,  one detail at a time. Occasionally,  you can invent a detail at random,  and then try to connect it with what you already have. As your character gets more detailed,  you may have to start pruning stuff that doesn't fit as nicely as it used to,  but that's natural.

            So my backstory is something along the lines of,  my character lived in a Town that was founded when the leader of a band of explorers had a turtle dropped on his head by a hawk who mistook his bald head for a rock (Yes I stole this from another story) and ended up having to stay a few days in a place to recover,  during that time the party realized that it would be a great spot for a town.
<p></p>Every summer the town holds a Founder's day celebration that involves a lot of turtle themed stuff.  Just about everyone in the town has a turtle themed cutie mark of some sort.  My character got caught cheating by greasing up her turtle for the turtle races and actually earned the cutie mark for it,  which lead people to believe she got her cutie mark for cheating (thats not exactly the case though... I havent fully worked out that part of the story).  She gets renamed based on her cutie mark and eventually leaves town but keeps the name to remind her of her past.
<p></p>She eventually finds herself in the seedy underbelly of a larger city,  and sets up a gambling den.  She gets accused of fixing her games (someone finds out about her cutie mark story) and she gets run out of town... leaving her a bit of a wanderer at the moment.
<p></p>Thats the short version <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>@Kegi she's more a charlattan/rogue sort,  really not of the bardic persuasion I suppose.  The bard Im most familiar with (The Elder Scrolls version) is more of an acrobat
