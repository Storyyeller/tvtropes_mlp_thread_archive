            Man,  does it say something about my self-esteem as a designer that when an old schoolmate told me he'd only ever heard about my work ethic and works second hand(And therefore couldn't in good conscious recommend me for a job),  I read it as second rate?
<p></p>I'm probably just bummed about having to go back to my old job after this week. Mmf.
<p></p>Anyways,  to take this back around to ponies,  my thoughts on the Applejack Microseries: Mmmmmmmeh.
<p></p>I really wish I could give it something better than that,  but I honestly only thought it was just okay,  and nothing special. The art was good,  but similar to the main series,  and I'll admit that I've grown to like seeing the microseries comics have unique styles.
<p></p>But story-wise,  it was basically an Applejack episode. Oh,  Applejack tries to take on too much responsibility for the sake of somepony else,  and can't quite manage it. That's the plot of almost every episode we've seen revolving around her. If even the <em>comics</em> people can't come up with a decent,  original story... I mean,  really. That said... there was one,  <em>one</em> moment that I really loved. After Applejack remembers Granny Smith telling her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's not her job to make sure everything's perfect,  she wonders aloud,  'Then whose is it?'</span>
<p></p>That one line,  four simple words,  speaks <em>volumes</em> about Applejack's motivations. In four words she goes from a collected,  albeit pig-headed,  confidant young woman,  to a girl still very likely struggling with the existential punch of losing her parents at a young age. <em>Someone's</em> got to be in charge of it all,  <em>someones</em> got to make sure it all turns out right in the end... Yeah,  it's an extrapolation to assume that she's thinking about her folks there,  but one way or another if you stop and think about it,  it's an incredibly powerful line... I just wish it were in something that was better on the whole.

            @Kegisak: What really irks me about that is that I can think of plenty ideas of what to do with AJ that don't consist of that. I <em>still</em> want an episode where she goes on strike after everyone starts taking advantage of her work ethic.  Or something that had to do with her prioritization of practicality over anything else.  Heck,  they could make it unrelated to her work ethic at all.  They could have another episode about her stubborn-ness,  but applied to something else. Like maybe one of the other ponies tries to drag her to something she doesn't think she'd enjoy it and refuses to acknowledge that she might.
<p></p>It <em>might</em> step on "Read it and Weep"'s toes a bit,  but the motivation would be different.  AJ just prefers to stick to what she knows and thinks new stuff is a waste of her time.

            @JT: I imagine mostponies don't take advantage of AJ because they remember her parents. I was imagining a scenario where AJ's lack of parents gets focused on,  much to her growing irritation.

            I <em>think</em> it's because her obsessiveness is the most likely thing to cause a schism,  at least without some complicated morals. Like,  they could do an episode on how sometimes lying is actually the best option,  but that'd be hard to impart well on children. They could do an episode on how she feels bad that she <em>doesn't</em> have a goal in life to strive for,  since she's already got what she wants,  but that's a <em>weird</em> moral for kids.
<p></p>But,  heck,  a lot of those issues would disappear if she got <em>used</em> more,  and therefore developed more character. Like,  it's obvious she doesn't care for Pinkie that much. Throw those two together and see what happens. The ensuing episode would <em>definitely</em> bring some stuff about AJ to the surface.

            I know,  it's like they're in this bizarre rut where the only thing they can come up with is "AJ has a really stubborn work ethic",  while completely forgetting that she can be stubborn about <em>other things</em>.  Seriously,  have her help Twilight clean the library and then get annoyed by Twilight's OCD or something.
<p></p>@Kegisak: An AJ and Pinkie episode? Do want.  It would be amazing.  Seriously,  I'd love to see what would happen when her patience gets tested to the limit. And it could double as a "Pinkie learns that she sometimes has to be serious" episode,  which I'd also like to see.

            Or even alternatively,  an "AJ Learns that sometimes kicking back and being silly is a good thing too"
<p></p>I mean,  if you're really so strapped for ideas,  you can at least push the one you do have to the limit. Even when AJ isn't killing herself with work,  she's still working non-stop. Does she ever really get a chance to hang up the work duds and like... knit,  or something?
<p></p>There's an episode idea. AJ needs to do... nothing. All the work is done,  and now she has to deal with the greatest challenge of all: Free Time. Seriously,  as someone who at one point spent a solid three months doing <em>nothing</em> but working,  free time can be <em>terrifying</em> when it comes back to you suddenly.

            Like an "AJ injures herself,  can't work,  and has no clue what to do with her time" episode? I like it.  Seriously,  AJ is an underused character. There's so much they could do with her,  and it just never happens.

            I wonder if she really likes to work that much or just feels she has to because of her self image. It could be interesting to see in the case where she does get downtime.
