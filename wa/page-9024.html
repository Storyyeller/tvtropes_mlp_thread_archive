            @Ginger It's one thing to be annoyed by things in a story,  but you seem to be giving it the same weight as a legitimate personal problem. That in and of itself may very well be a legitimate personal problem. If you stopped taking entertainment so seriously,  then maybe you'd be able to not tear yourself apart over these <em>really</em> minor things.

Wouldn't that go for pretty much everyone? It's kind of a slap in the face for the one offering help.

            One way I've dealt with characters I hate is making up stories where bad things happen to them,  but if you're not as into writing your own stories that might not work as well for you.  Or you could rip up a picture of Goldenblood if he has any pictures of him,  or make your own if you ever do any drawing.
<p></p>On that birthday thing,  I switched lives with Spitfire.  Not so sure I'd like that.  I'd like the ability to fly,  but I don't think I'd want to be a famous stunt flyer who gets mobbed by crowds and stuff.  Too much annoying attention from strangers for me.
