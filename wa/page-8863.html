            I dunno,  I like the concept of glee style covers,  but then maybe I'm just jealous because I never got to take chorus all through high school. Though their execution admittedly leaves much to be desired.
<p></p>If Glee did one good thing it introduced me to <em>Don't Stop Beleiving</em>

            @Kyler: It's more that I just don't really like the style as a whole,  even if they made original music.  I'm sure there are a few songs out there that I would enjoy,  but for the most part it just isn't my type of music,  and of all the music the show uses,  it's a <em>really</em> safe bet that I'd prefer the original versions.
<p></p>@Ginger: I know what you mean.  I don't ''hate' Beiber,  I just think that his popularity far exceeds the quality of his output and that there are other artists who deserve the attention more.

            You know what would be an interesting future episode? An episode where the main six play a game that's an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonsAndDragons" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>. Among other things,  there could be a bit where each of them takes it in turns being the Game Master to try to figure out who's the most suited for it. I imagine it would start with Twilight digging up the game from somewhere,  and being the first game master. She'd build up the story of the game,  only for Rainbow Dash to demand she get to the action sooner. And then shenanigans happen.
<p></p>And it would involve bits of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepImmersionGaming" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepImmersionGaming">Deep Immersion Gaming</a>,  in the same vein as the Daring Doo segments from Read It And Weep.

            Yeah,  that would be really interesting.  Another similar idea would be to have the cast tell a round robin type story.  I think it would be easier to get the plot started,  and it would be easier to switch between them and switch genres.  Like Rainbow Dash would put the whole thing in space or something.

            Each of them would have a moment where they try to run the game their way. Not sure who would be the game master at the end. Twilight,  Rainbow Dash,  and Pinkie would probably not be the best (too much roleplaying,  too many random encounters,  and too many <em>random</em> encounters,  respectively).
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> That could also work nicely,  and yeah,  it would get to the revolving story-types more easily.

            Weirdly enough I think Rarity would be a good game master.  She's dramatic enough that she'd have a good amount of danger,  but she's also too fancy to run a pure "kill everything you meet" campaign.  Applejack would have too many issues with rolling up monsters and whatnot,  and Fluttershy would do away with combat altogether.

            and not Fluttershy either. Probably Rarity actually. She has a flair for the dramatic. Something a good dungeon master needs. but would she actually be interested in playing the game properly and would she have fun?

            Twi would be the ultimate rules lawyer
<p></p>Rarity would spend all her time descrabing all the little details of the setting/weapons/armor etc.. and never get to actaully doing anything
<p></p>RD would be the overblown Me vs Them type that makes the group work for everything though unfair odds.
<p></p>pinkie would just be random
<p></p>Fluttershy would be to sacred to stand up to the group or do anything mean,  giving them extra saving throws and bonues just so they wn't be mad.
<p></p>AJ,  AJ would probably be the best GM,  as long as she doesn't think the whole thing is a waaste of time.

            Rarity,  I think,  would enjoy a game like that. She relishes a good chance to flex her creative muscle,  as it were.
<p></p>I imagine she'd spend a day drawing her character,  <em>long</em> before actually working out her stats,  though.
<p></p>As for characters: Twilight would be a mage,  of course,  Rainbow Dash would be a warrior or barbarian type,  Fluttershuy would probably be a ranger or druid or somesuch,  Applejack would also be a monk type,  Pinkie would be a Bard or Dancer or something,  and Rarity would be... I dunno. Something that focuses on dexterity or finesse. A fencer or rogue,  perhaps.

            AJ for a flaw like the others could maybe end up with a Workaholic outlook and make the game too mundane for everyone else. Either that or her and RD could get too competitive.
<p></p>Twilight would probably make sure everyone has the correct amount of puzzle pieces and go through the instructions several times over,  while RD destroys everything in about one swoop.
<p></p>Pinkie's would be...something to behold.
<p></p>Rarity probably would draw away from any rough action,  thus a large point of the game,  while Fluttershy would try too hard to compromise with everyone else's plans,  ruining the point of her being in charge.
<p></p>Probably end up a 'compromise' episode where all of them take turns being the Game Master since either one doesn't get anywhere due to their own personality follies getting in the way.
