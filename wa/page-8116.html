            Re: White Dove,  well that sucks,  but at least bronies are taking it well,  sure some are pissed at Hasbro but most seem to understand that it's all the fault of the bullshit US Copyright Laws and aren't holding it agsint them.
<p></p>Seems as long as they have <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniablity" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniablity">Plausible Deniablity</a> that they did not know about it there cool with the plushies. It's only when they are at risk of losing copyright claim that they step in. Same with the youtube vids,  they took down just enough to make the lawyers happy but didn't go on a crusade to block them all.
<p></p>Though a lot of people have a good idea,  she should see if she could work out some type of licensing deal.

            @Librarian: Interestingly. I'm in a hotel at the moment,  looking at various apartments. It's not going well so far; nothing really strikes my fancy. The best I've gotten has only really been 'meh'. Which is still far cry better than the others...
<p></p>But I've got more tours booked tomorrow,  and plenty options on the way. I'm also looking at 4 bedroom places at the moment,  and I'm seriously considering just saying fuck it to roommates,  going for a single and getting a cat or dog. Might be easier to look that way.
<p></p>Because I mean,  it's one thing if an apartment feels a bit small for ME. It's another if it feels a bit small for four people.

            Yeah,  but if Hasbro found it themselves,  that's one thing. If someone essentially mails them and says "Psst...This one's making MLP plushies. Why don'tcha go rough her up some?" it's another entirely.

            well the story we're hearing is that someone specifically made sure Hasbro was aware. And judging by the wording they said on the C&D they dind't tell her to stop making the plushies,  just stop advertising about them on DA.
<p></p>Also seems it's Trademark not Copyright,  but not like 90% of people can really tell the difference.

            The issue (technically) was not that she was selling pony plushies. Hasbro could overlook it in legal terms as long as she didn't do anything illegal. Problem was some asshole reported her explicitly forcing Hasbro to step into the legal arena and bring down the hammer. Trademark laws. For a similar example see what happened when notch registered the Scrolls trademark.
