            I need to look up Naoto's social link arc. I feel bad that I can't even start it with her,  let alone finish it,  just because I <em>know</em> it would be amazing.
<p></p>But Kanji's arc rang pretty much perfectly with me. A big guy who started playing tough to scare people away because it was easier,  and kept playing tough because it was what was expected... pretty much every part of his arc was a big 'I know that feel,  bro'. I enjoyed all of the other arcs,  but none of them made me so genuinely happy to see him come out the other end as his. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and I MAY have gotten a bit of a crush on him. He's adorable!</span>
