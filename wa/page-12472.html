            @Seraphem Then it's poor writing. If that was the case in the canon of the story,  then the story should have indicated it in some way instead of leaving people to headcanon around it like you are now.

            how would they know? Velvet is the only pony that we know who actually strives to expand past her limits,  while still being constrained to a few select types of spells. All they have is two hundred year old information,  which likely decays and degrades with time,  with no pony having any real ability to simply test this stuff in any sort of controlled environment.
<p></p>It really seems nopony actually truly understands how magic works,  what Velevt rattled off was the text book definition they all learned as foals,  but it says nothing about HOW it works,  why they are limited,  ANY details beyond 'this is how it is....because we say so" Without knowing the details behind the how and why,  it impossible to say anything violates it because it violates another casual effect of those same base details. Without knowing WHY a unicorn is limited you can't know whether it could be possible to surpass those limits in some way that nopony ever tried.

<p></p>@Seraphem: I think it <em>can</em> be understandable,  but the thing is we've never seen her have such a strong reaction to something like that before.  The only episode that even comes <em>close</em> to freaking her out so much was Dragonshy,  and that was all about her phobia.

<p></p>well,  that's a matter of disliking the basic premise of the story. And,  ya know,  that's totally fine. I just think Pannic hates it because he's trying judge it as something it's not. Like slamming a mindless action flick for not having a deep plot or something.

<p></p>It's true you can get through them in a pacifist run. But a pacifist run requires either a hell of a silver tongue or ninja like stealth skills,  usually both. Neither of which are abilities Pip excels in. So even is she doesn't like it,  and it causes her a lot of angst,  violence is her first answer because it's what she's good at.

            Well,  I'd consider it rude to not respond to several paragraphs written as a response to my minor gripes,  though I'm not sure why it's a big deal,  either.
<p></p>@Seraph I guess the last thing to say on the subject is that <em>you</em> don't know either,  and I'd prefer to take what a story states as facts at face value unless sufficient indication is given otherwise. Nothing's wrong with you having your headcanon. Just don't get mad at me for sticking to what the story says as a basis for an (again,  <em>minor</em>) issue I have with the writing.

            @ lurker,  well like Story sid,  it's a debate we keep having here how much it effects magic,  and i'd say there IS evidence it's wrong in story,  since velvet DID do it,  there fore it IS possible,  therefor that information was wrong/incomplete.
<p></p>oh and as to the canon ponies in the backstory. everything we see them do,  is doen after they spend years,  if not decades living in a society at constant war. Something the story makes very clear to tell us is something ponies simply are NOT physiologically able to handle well. nothing seems so far past OOC for them that can't be explained by that (or the PTM addiction in Pinkies case.) and not just living in it,  but being put in chage of trying to end it,  of seeing all the dtails,  knwing everything that goes wrong,  every slip,  every death,  and knowing that it was their job to stop it.

<p></p>I actually thought it was an extremely clever touch. This fandom is rife with female/female shipping,  so here in this fanfic we have an OC pony who's a lesbian,  but in flashbacks the mane six are completely straight (though they enjoy teasing Applejack for some reason).
