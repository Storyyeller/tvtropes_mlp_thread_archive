            Hey guys just come back from a relatives BBQ,  it was not too bad and it was far from boring as I thought it would be. I had a Burger and a hot dog and a bit of chicken to eat did abit of Animal Crossing New Leaf while I was there. But I have got a pounding headache from being with my two younger cousins while I was there,  they are nice kids,  very adorable and very sweet kids but there is so many times when you can actually play around with them.
<p></p>So we talking about weird ass dreams huh? Well funny enough I have two dreams that are actually MLP related. The first dream I can't remember quite clearly but I do know that it had Rarity and Rainbow Dash they were both standing near a hot balloon and I think I must've have gotten in it and that's it.
<p></p>The other dream I can remember clearly because it involved me in a psychadelic enviroment that would put any Disney Acid Sequence to shame,  the background was a mixture of swirling colours of purpish black just flashing before my very eyes. First I encountered a fat version of Bubbles from the Powerpuff Girls who looked she had been stuffing her face with so many cakes that it wasn't funny....I have no idea why there was an overweight version of Bubbles nor do I wish to know but I could tell that she been stuffing her face because there were crumbs around her mouth. She was literally taller than her normal self but that's all I'm gonna discuss about that next things started to get trippy as the background start spinning itself along with me around and around and around until it looked like I was gonna throw up.
<p></p>Then I encountered Twilight Sparkle in the dream who for whatever reason was all dressed up like Lydia from Beetlejuice,  I talk to her for a bit and then the dreams ends....I have got no comment on that....

            So my sister has been watching <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalDramaIsland" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalDramaIsland">Total Drama Island</a> while I've been around,  and now I've got this situation running in my head: Imagine that Discord host's a show similar to Total Drama Island,  and he chooses 16 characters as contestents {Since that was the amount from Total Drama Island}. The characters would be The Mane 6,  Spike,  the CMC's,  Gilda,  Trixie,  Lighting Dust,  Luna,  Derpy and Prince Blueblood. What kind of weird situations would the contestents find themselves in,  and who would win in the end?
<p></p>Also,  Iron Will would probably be Discord's assistant and thus the idea's equivilent of Chef,  because why not?<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
