            Yeah,  throw me into the "I think it's interesting but don't really care much about it in canon".  I view shipping almost entirely through a "what if" lens to explore what the theoretical relationships would look like.

            I have to admit,  that parts of the fandom do seem a bit disingenuous in some ways.  Such as how parts of it espouse "love and tolerance" and still spouts the same vitriol that it claims to despise.

            yes,  becuase clearly the fanbase is one hive mind and couldn't possibly have people with differing opinions. "Love and tolerance" is an ideal that many ,  not all,  poeple in the fanbase feel is important,  doesn't mean others can't differ. Also I rarely see any viriol,  yes you are going to have some people at that end of the bell curve,  but they are far far FAR a minority,  anyone can just pick and choose the worst examples and ignore the whole
<p></p>Overall this fanbase is just incredible,  and very,  very genuine.

            The truth is,  I don't hold this fanbase to THAT much higher of a standard than any other. Some people will always be assholes,  and some people will always be classy. If the assholes want to be disingenuous about it,  I can't do much about it except ignore 'em. I'd rather focus on the people who ARE good and decent. Like you guys. (Glomps everyone)
<p></p>EDIT: I dislike conflict heavily,  especially when it's among people I care about. But I've had to force myself to learn to take the bad with the good.

            @Seraph: What I mean is,  I think the fandom as a whole has a bit of a front that it puts up,  perhaps because of how it USED to be. I hopped on the wagon when it was still relatively small; <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EqD" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EqD">Eq D</a> made maybe a post or two per day,  and they were mostly madmax's comics with the odd fanfiction. Derpy was occasionally portrayed as just a normal girl with a funny eye,  and the peoples in the fandom genuinely followed the 'love and tolerance' mantra. It was a small amount of very reasonable people who got into it because they were reasonable enough to try it on their own,  and it showed. then as the fandom started to get larger,  more people were drawn in from... different walks of life. The 'love and tolerance' mantra became an "I'm better than you" badge,  and the phrase began to lose it's meaning. In fact,  the phrase itself is sometimes even used as a reason <em>not</em> to do so - WE love and tolerate,  so we're better than them and can swear at them,  cuss them out,  and make fun of them. I've seen bronies almost universally bash different groups - furries,  other fandoms,  people who don't watch the show,  hasbro,  even <em>each other</em>. It's become wildly divisive in a lot of ways,  and compared to what it USED to be it honestly depresses me a tad.
<p></p>I mean,  there are parts of it that are still good. When the people like things,  they like them. It's a good fandom for producers,  but as a community... I don't want any part of the community. Give me what fans I have,  and a few good friends. The rest can stay away.

            only thing that kinda annoys me about the fandom as a whole is the tendency to sorta over react to perceived drama,  really there very little I'd consider actual "Drama" in the fandom (With the exception of Derpnarock) and most of times,  even then,  there's more people upset over the perceived presence of drama then there are people concerned with whatever is causing the drama itself.

            I don't associate with the fandom at large. You folks are fandom enough for me.
<p></p>Then again,  I'm not a big fan of large communities anyway. I like things a little more tightly-knit.

It's unfortunate that some members of the fandom have to be nasty,  but it was rather inevitable.  There are definitely some parts of the fanbase that I kinda wish would just go away,  but there's also a lot of cool stuff that comes out of it.
