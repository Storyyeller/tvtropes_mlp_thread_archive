            Yeah,  the lack of Derpy this season has been a bit weird.  I don't know if they want to save her for some big moment,  or if they're just trying not to over saturate the show with Derpy.  They'll just do that with the merch instead.

            I read twice on the show's Tvtropes pages that Hasbro has been forcing the studio to gradually phase her out until she'll no longer be part of the show by Season 4!

I call baseless fear-mongering until someone gets a source for that intel.

            time for another fanfic report!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Dear Thread Manor...
<p></p>I have some stories of a slightly different sort this time. I actually read some shipping! I've got some of that,  a bit of light comedy/slice of life,  and finally a story more in line with what I usually read. Lets start with the shipping and save the usual fare for last,  hmm?
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/1700/those-blue-wings">Those Blue Wings<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. In and attempt to get to Canterlot in a hurry,  Twilight botches a group teleport spell,  swapping <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RDs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RDs">R Ds</a> wings and tail with AJ. Having to wait some weeks before Twilight can fix things,  RD moves in with AJ,  both because she can't reach her own cloud house anymore and to keep an eye on her wings. <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppleDash" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppleDash">Apple Dash</a> ensues.
<p></p>I actually read a shipping story! That's like my second one ever,  after JT's! And it wasn't that bad. I'm still not much a fan of shipping,  but this story was fairly enjoyable.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/41313/mood-wings">Mood Wings<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Twilight,  while going through her collection,  finds a book on pegasi body language. Ever a pony of science,  Twilight decides to head into town for some filed research to make some observations of her own. Hilarity and light shipping ensues.
<p></p>a nice little comedy fic. at under 10k words,  there's not much reason not to try it out!
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/52787/suddenly-a-filly">Suddenly,  a Filly!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>- in progress. Twilight wakes up one morning to discover something is very wrong. Specifically,  she's a little filly again,  blank flank and all. Twilight does her best to figure out how and why this has happened while keeping it a secret from the others,  but with only the magical ability of a young filly,  she doesn't have much luck. When the rest of the girls find out they decide that spike can't possibly take of the library and a young filly,  and decide to take turns watching after filly Twilight. Hilarity and adorableness ensues.
<p></p>this is a cute little story,  but I can't say I'm a big fan of the premise. Or rather,  the story isn't going the way I thought it would. Still worth a read.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/48663/the-legend-of-the-arachnapony">The Legend of the Arachnapony<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>- in progress. On the way back from a trip to Zecora's,  Apple Bloom gets lost in the Everfree and almost killed by Timberwolves. However,  at the last moment she is saved by a mysterious being that refuses to reveal itself,  staying concealed in the forest canopy above. When she gets back to Ponyville,  however,  nopony but her closest friends believes her! Not even her big sister! Now the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs">CM Cs</a> and ace photographer Featherweight are going to get to the bottom of what exactly this mysterious yet apparently benevolent creature is...
<p></p>yes,  that's right,  a spider pony. Just look at the cover image! how awesome is that! And the story so far is pretty awesome too! This was my favorite one out of this batch!
<p></p>That's all for now,  see you next time!

            My stance on Derpy; I would have <em>preferred</em> they stuck to the name Ditzy Doo (which Amy Rogers said was going to be the case until a last minute change for the sake of a more obvious <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomNod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomNod">Fandom Nod</a>) as it was a name the writers came up with themselves (and not some guy on 4chan) and was already used for an established-as-but-not-seen-silly pony. I don't mind calling her Derpy though,  and I'm sure the controversy probably would still have happened if they called her Bubbles or Grey Pony.
<p></p>I do wonder if there was actually a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentMajority" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentMajority">Silent Majority</a> complaining about Derpy that we never knew about. A bunch of angry parents/legitimately offended people going straight to Hasbro and never posted on Internet forums or starting up petitions? That always seemed more likely to me than the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority">Vocal Minority</a> of fans complaining how their precious Derpy turned out.
<p></p>It amuses me,  in a bizarre way,  that Hasbro keeps finding ways to avoid calling her by name. Her Special Edition Toy,  completely unnamed. The <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyLittlePony" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyLittlePony">Gameloft game</a>,  not playable (unlike most of her BG peers) but appears in a way that doesn't require her to be named on screen. The <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicIDW" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicIDW">comic series</a>,  gets a whole scene in the first issue but Twilight refers to her as "that pony",  and gets a spider counterpart (the only spider to have <em>dialogue</em>,  she/<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewerGenderConfusion" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewerGenderConfusion">he?</a> makes a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout Out</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheFarSide" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheFarSide">The Far Side</a>) in the second issue.
<p></p>Look,  Hasbro,  I can accept if you never want to call her Derpy again,  but call her <em>something</em>. Come up with a new name if you have too,  bronies won't complain as much as you think they will. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">I think</a>.

            Oh no,  I'm sure there will be bronies who will complain a lot,  but it will be a bunch of empty threats that do nothing but annoy everyone and eventually it will all just sort of fade to minor grumblings.

            Ignoring the fact that they have to put <em>something</em> in the register to identify that item,  my point still stands. Why not put the name Derpy Hooves or Ditzy Doo on the box,  for a collector's toy that's clearly marketed to the brony demographic and sold in a store where the MLP target demographic isn't dragging their parents into? I've been in the local Hot Topic many times (you can find a good,  if overpriced,  classic rock shirt there every now &amp; then) and I've never seen a little girl there dragging their mom around asking for ponies.
<p></p>I don't think they're removing her from the show,  I'm in the camp that they've decided not to overuse her this season because Season 2 was getting ridiculous with her. Fluttershy's chicken coop? Filly Derpy in the present? Cranky's <em>snowglobe</em>? There were times she seemed more like a joke than a character,  and do bronies <em>really</em> want that?

Two of those three scenes you mention were inspirations for the fanfic I'm writing. I got to wondering just how Derpy showed up in those places,  and came up with explanations. Really weird explanations,  but still.
