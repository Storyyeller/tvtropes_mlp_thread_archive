            Then why insist that an episode that had nothing to  do with religious belief is really an endorsement of religion?  Heck the pilots were much more religious than "Feeling Pinkie Keen" but no one complained about them (for that reason).

            @Rhyme I think the way the morale was worded got to people.  "[T]here are wonderful things in this world you just can't explain,  but that doesn't necessarily make them any less true.  It just means you have to choose to believe in them" rubs me the wrong way.  It really does sound anti-skepticism,  even if Twilight wasn't doing a great job of staying objective.  I just tend to ignore it,  but I can see why some people might get worked up.
<p></p>And now for some drawings:

            ^^From a certain standpoint,  not one that I endorse,  it's possible to see "Pinkie Keen" as saying that some things that can't be explained should be treated as true on faith,  while anyone who tries to approach it scientifically is being arbitrarily and close-mindedly skeptical.  I have no issue admitting it when things are unexplainable,  but I do like to see people give a fair whack at it first.

            On the subject of Feeling Pinkie Keen,  I really think that the moral was just taked on at the end after they figured out what they wanted to do with the episode. I admit that I have no real proof to back my claim up,  but the whole episode really did not seem designed to actually promote its moral so much as it was designed to be a really overt slap-stick episode staring Pinkie and Twilight. My guess is that someone (possibly the writer,  possibly one of the animators) had a really great idea for a Looney Tunesesque episode and then remebered that they had to put moral at the end. Again,  no real proof on my part just my own speculation.

        <div class="post-content">
            @ kyler this is the analysis I promised you. ( pardon me for killing the English language)
<p></p>This are my two cents on in universe pony beauty.
<p></p>Based On the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfBeauty" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfBeauty">Sliding Scale of Beauty</a>
<p></p>Highest must Celestia. She is hinted to be the ideal of beauty
<p></p>I quote the entry of <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotGodess" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotGodess">Hot Godess</a>
..." she is drawn more aesthetically - more clean,  shiny,  "beautiful" and pretty,  right down to her voice - compared to the rest of the cast. It's vaguely implied that she's the ideal for equine beauty in Equestria; the beauty parlor in Ponyville has a picture of a pony with her tall and slender proportions,  for instance."
<p></p>Celestia is a Divine Level
<p></p>Rarity is also very beautiful,  as the sonic Rainboom showed,  ponies were very impressed of her. Sure her temporal wings were part of it. But there us no denial her beauty convinced them too. The grand galloping Gala also showed that even without her wings,  she was also able to charm male ponies to drawing her carriage.
<p></p>She is a World Class beauty.
<p></p>Fluttershy is also very beautiful as shown on Green isn't your color. She  became a supermodel loved by all,  used as a public image for products,  became a super star  and unable to be unliked without twilight's magic.
<p></p>She also ranks World-class
<p></p>Now from this part it gets tricky( from this point this has speculation) as none of the remaining ponies are known for their beauty. But it can be said that they are less pretty than top 3.
<p></p><a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppleJack" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppleJack">Apple Jack</a>
<p></p>Her beauty is never mentioned directly but we do know that she is the second pony most confident of Her beauty (after Rarity) by body language <a class="urllink" href="http://images.wikia.com/vssaxtonhale/images/5/51/250px-Applejack.jpg">[1]<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small>
<a class="urllink" href="http://www.google.es/m/search?site=images&amp;source=mog&amp;hl=es&amp;gl=es&amp;client=safari&amp;q=applejack&amp;sa=N#i=163">[2]<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<p></p>We also get hints that <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely">She Cleans Up Nicely</a> on the Sonic rainboom. when she is with her orange relatives.
<p></p>She is very likely a Common beauty
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/116/f/1/filly_applejack_by_kaitsurinn-d3ez0y3.png">[3]<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small>
<p></p>Pinkie Pie is  at the very least a Special average. We know she isn't ugly and at the very least she is average. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles">But her eternal smile,  happy disposition and overall positive attitude put her on the special average</a>. She always cares to look pleasent/funny than  "atractive" and she succeeds
<p></p>Special average at least
<p></p>Rainbow Dash is also tricky as she isn't known for her beauty either. But we do know that her rainbow mane isn't common. We have seen many ponies with at most two colors on their manes ( twilight).She is also described as pretty but in a "cool looking way"(debatable I know) That may make her a Cool Average
<p></p>Probable cool average
<p></p>Twilight Sparkle doesn't get any mention of beauty.Not even indirectly.
<p></p>Her lack of social interaction may hint that she isn't very pretty. Compare Fluttershy despite being very shy and disliking being on the spotlight got a lot of attention for her beauty regardless. Also being so close to Celestia would make her more popular.
<p></p>She is also the most indifferent on her looks just before pinkie pie ( pinkie cares to look funny). While twilight didn't cared for hers 
<p></p>While she is known for her abilities she is the only one of the mane cast not known for her looks in any way, 
<p></p>Until more evidence is gathered she seems to be Average looking.Hence the reason I believe she is probably the ugliest of the mane cast

            @Kurou,  oh dear lord did that episode piss me the fuck off. They pulled Pinkie's precognitive ability right out of their ass,  make it look as if it happens ALL THE TIME and then they never use it again! It's blatantly clear that they just made it up for that episode just so they could hammer home that stereotypes bullshit aesop about not thinking about things critically! It is an incredibly disturbing trend in Western Animation and it's showing up all over. I still remember getting this fucking pissed over an episode of Young justice called Denial where one of the characters (Kid Flash) fits the role of the Straw Skeptic and it's just as fucking depressing and horrible as this horseshit!

<p></p>No,  the proper tem is "Dykedash"
<p></p>Also,  is Equestria a land or the planet? The opening of the first episode,  it's referred to as a land,  but in Feeling Pinkie Keen,  Twilight mentions "the wide world of Equestria".

That episode made her actually actively offensive. There's Twilight being both a good rationalist AND a scientist,  actually working hard to try and find out just what the fuck is going on,  and she's being punished for it! Every time she suffered on account of her efforts through some pratfall or Rube Goldberg device-style mechanism,  I didn't laugh- I felt sick.

            @ Gault. As a person who has been Thumped repeatedly,  I think you should listen to them and tone it down.

She was really obnoxious in that episode,  and even if she didn't mean it,  she still gave off an air of Smug superiority,  she KNOWS what's going to happen,  and there's nothing you can do about it. (actually I think it's the fact that someone with her personality posessed omniscience that was annoying

So Pinkie frustrates me half the time. I especially hated the way she instantly knew that Twilight was following her,  and the way she instantly pulled her hooves out of those clamps. It gives me the impression that Pinkie was just fucking with Twilight at her friend's expense.

Show with talking ponies,  who use hoofs just like we use hands,  with unicorns,  dragons,  sonic rainbooms,  magic,  curses,  manualy changed weather,  bears made of stars should not have thing what not hapen in real life.
<p></p>Sarcarsm aside: I love this episode. I'm ateist belining in many paranormal stuff,  but also rational with some interest in science and scientific way,  I also love TS and nothing wrong was in that ep for me. I enjoyed slapstick,  fact that Twilight act like Straw Sceptic (more like sceptic played for laught) who wasn't rational or scientific. Only thing what annoys me is rage of some fans.

PP Reality Warping is pure fanon thing.
