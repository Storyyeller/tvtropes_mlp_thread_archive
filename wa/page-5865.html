            Possibly there's a lot of stuff on Cloudsdale's end which,  while physically and visually less impressive,  requires a lot of technical know-how.

            Well,  I don't know,  maybe they just want the outlier towns to feel like they have some say? If it came down to it a few towns could probably produce all the resources needed for the entire country,  but that would lead to a brain-drain out of small towns to the big cities. That leads to small towns dying off,  and the creation of essentially three mega-cities. It lacks the intimacy of small towns,  there'll probably be lower standards of living in the cities,  and the quality of life in equestria as a whole would decline - not to mention the three tribes could easily faction themselves again. All in all,  allowing the smaller towns to provide some of the resources is likely the best for the country as a whole.
<p></p>Anyways,  I gotta hit the sack - it's nearly 4 AM here.
<p></p>Sigh. One of these days I'll start getting to bed sooner. Night folks.

            Good night,  Kegi.
<p></p>Could be that Cloudsdale give offers to the towns if they want to or can help when the arrive for the water and Rainbow accepted on everyone's behalf. As Weather Captain it is logical to assume she could recognise whether they could do it or not.

            but I mean,  even if they went to all these different places to use their water,  if it's still the cloudsdale crew then why wouldn't all the pegasi just go there to get work? Like I said,  it creates a labour drain. If Cloudsdale is the only place that has weather ponies,  all the weather ponies go there. After a while small towns would start to dry up.
<p></p>Okay. Goodnight for real this time.

            No thanks.
<p></p>Anyways,  I'd rather sell safety gear to any pegasi participating in making an EF-class storm just to get the waterspout,  because everypony wants fancy helmets and badass guards.

            Good morning friends,  I just had a pony dream but I remember very little of it but I can regal you with a few revelations: Snails's Cutie Mark is like Fluttershy's,  it means he's good with animals he just has some sort of connection with snails. This was demonstrated in my dream when he was working on some sort of project that required animals and he mentioned that the butterflies were his friends.
<p></p>Snips has an older brother who is also as big a joker as he is but is more popular.
<p></p>Snips is the dumb one,  not Snails.
