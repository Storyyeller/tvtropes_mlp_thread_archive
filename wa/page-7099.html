            Don't <em>most</em> people shower in the morning?
<p></p>....
<p></p>Anyway,  back to the Pinkie Pie character flanderization issue:
<p></p>To put it another way,  it feels like Pinkie Pie is going through the same process that Bugs Bunny and Woody Woodpecker went through.  Their earlier appearances were a little more... errr... "Extreme, " for lack of a better word,  but as time went on they got more "domesticated."
<p></p>I mean,  think about the kind of things Pinkie did in Season One:  she pulled pranks,  she shoved her ass in Twilight's face,  she beat up Rainbow Dash after having a psychotic breakdown,  she stalked Twi all over town to prevent her from telling secrets,  she often thinks she's communicating but either isn't,  or is communicating the wrong message,  and some of her fourth-wall antics actually weirded out the other ponies.
<p></p>The latter half of season two,  and particularly two of the three eps that actually focus on Pinkie (as well as her scenes in "It's About Time"),  feel like they're just big attempts to get away from this arguably-less-innocent image of her and make her more generic.  Instead of acting like she might be autistic or something,  she's instead just stupid.  And instead of being off in her own world,  the actual world literally revolves around her.
<p></p><em>Sigh</em>
<p></p>I know nobody but me is gonna get it.  It's like Rarity trying to explain what's wrong with the dresses she made in "Art of the Dress."  If you're not a dressmaker or have the insights of one,  you can't understand.   I'm honestly thinking I should make a video that explains these things,  but I don't know if that would help.

            Just got done showering. To answer your questions,  I ask this question: do you find it comfortable sleeping in your own filth?
<p></p>Also I can see where you're coming from,  Moe. She did kinda have many more dumb moments in Season 2 than she did in 1 (the whole RARITYCATCHME bit and its consequences come to mind).

            Personally for me the crowning moment of Pinkie flanderization is "I don't know who dun dood it."  I don't know who thought that was cute,  but it wasn't.  Poor Pinkie Pie...
<p></p>It's not all just her characterization either.  She's been used wrongly too.  "It's About Time" is a big offender,  and Pinkie's show-stealing is a lot of the reason I consider it worse than the otherwise-similar "Lesson Zero."

            Wow dantes,  you managed to actually knock the thread out <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>Seriously though,  I suspect you're reading Pinkie wrong if she more than half the time acts contary to how you perceive her. As she is I can empathise with her bigtime (having scored most like her on the bronyland quiz,  go figure).

<p></p>The "This day aria" reprises are pretty awesome so far.^^ I'm still bucking happy but the fact that no new episode will come before a few months kicked in. Meh,  I have 3 seasons of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorWho" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a> to watch in the mean time. Plus the fanfics and fanvids and fancomics should keep me occupied^^
<p></p>Now,  back to designing my Dalek hat. With EX-TER-MI-NATE shouts included.

            Heh,  so Moe Dantes also agrees with me that Amy Keating Rogers writes Pinkie Pie in an annoying way.  I don't understand the objection to non-pony civilizations,  though.  It actually bothers me more when we keep seeing just <em>one</em> member of every new alien species ever.
<p></p>An old My Little Pony marathon might be fun,  if you can find every episode in high quality.  Generation 3 has all those straight-to-DVD releases,  and with the short cartoons they started throwing in later,  I'm not sure what order you'd want to put them all together in; I know there's a few that haven't hit Youtube yet,  or at least not in good quality.  I've seen a couple of different episode orders for My Little Pony Tales too—maybe one of them is the production order?  My Little Pony 'n' Friends sounds promising,  if you get the original VHS rips of the two specials followed by The Movie first,  and if you can find the uncut version of "The Glass Princess Part 4".

<p></p>Hmm,  I hadn't thought about my reading speed in a while.  I wonder if using the Internet so much has ruined it somewhat,  since there's no pressure to read anything from beginning to end,  so I develop a habit of jumping ahead to find only the most interesting bits. Then if I feel like I missed something I wanted to see,  I have to go back and figure out what it was,  trying to remember what I did and didn't read,  then put it all back together in my mind before I can move on.  Yeah,  that's a bad flow.
<p></p>I actually did take a speed-reading course a very long time ago,  but I'm pretty sure I didn't practice nearly long enough for it to have any real benefit.  Let's see if I can remember any tips that could help Ginger...   I know the fastest reader used a technique where you sweep your hand back and forth down the page to sorta guide your eye into looking at the next line at the proper time.  But again,  I don't want to do that with a laptop computer!  Then there was the suggestion that you block out the "voice in your head" that slows you down because it makes you only read at the speed of sound.  I guess that would help,  but,  I'm starting to believe that hearing a voice strengthens comprehension and retention a lot for me,  in addition to whatever other dramatization my mind needs to do to enjoy what I'm reading.  So,  if I'm pressed for time,  I just force that voice in my head to be the voice of the fastest talker in the world,  so not only am I reading faster,  but I have the entertainment of listening to the fastest talker in the world. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">
