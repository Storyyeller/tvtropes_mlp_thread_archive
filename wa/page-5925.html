            Hello everyone. I see y'all are talking about the previous generations. All I know about them is from people that reviewed them,  like this one: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K2aIA6nOiw">Familiar Faces<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. That one is from a guy who likes MLPFIM

            The two G1 things I watched were the one where the "Big Brother Ponies" return and there's this sorceress with a bird with magic singing that hypnotizes the ponies so she can steal their youth and magic.
<p></p>And the other was the one with that "Knight Shade" character and that bad guy that steals shadows so this other bad guy can eat them.

            You know,  this talk about G1 villains made me thing of nightmare moon and how villainous she was. It struck me that in the Everfree forest she was actively trying to <em>kill</em> the mane 6 at times. The first thing she does is collapse the cliff,  which if is wasn't for the pegasi saving the day would have lead to 4 of the 6 plummeting down a large drop. Then she enraged a Manticore,  which did attack,  and would probably have killed if given the chance. then she simply tried so scare them away with scary trees,  which failed. As for Steven Magnet,  I like to thing that Nightmare was hoping he would enrage and attack,  not start crying. (which gives me a funny 'you have got to be kidding me' image of NM). I guess here she started to worry,  so she tries to get them to betray each other (and she picks who she thinks the most likely to betray the others) as killing or routing wasn't working. All in all,  she was a straight up evil villain,  regardless of it only being a girls cartoon.

            I love how we over analyze this show so much...
<p></p>And right now I got back into knitting. I want to make a Rainbow Dash hat. The only problem is that I don't have that many colors. And it rarely gets cold enough to justify wearing a hat in Texas XD
<p></p>I'm guessing a few of y'all saw the review I posted? :3

            My favorite villain is by far the Diamond Dogs. They were competent,  had cool designs,  and a good motive.

            Eeyup. And I think that the villain for the finale might be tainted by the same thing as Nightmare Moon. That would be pretty cool.
