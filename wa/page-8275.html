            Wasn't her original name Ditzy Do? That kinda spells a pony that isn't all there.
<p></p>Derpy's whole characterization was mostly formed by an animation error. It's likely not what they were aiming for initially,  but in all fairness they likely wouldn't have even bothered with her if it hadn't happened. It's not the best personality,  but it's A personality.

            @Death Cloud: I agree. I'm surprised the show hasn't got flak from feminist executives yet,  insisting they revert to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PositiveDiscrimination" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PositiveDiscrimination">Positive Discrimination</a> and have a mane cast filled with generic role models.
<p></p>Derpy I see as VERY clumsy and sorta goofy. Likely not <em>too</em> bright either given The Last Roundup.

            I'm with Freemen on this one. I also see Derpy as sort of a really weird pony too. Not dumb,  just really odd at times {Kinda like Pinkie,  but a bit more diffrent}.

            We're not having a go at you ginger. It's just such quirks like crazy eyes are often connected to goofy acting characters so I suppose they saw her that way. I mean it's fun to attribute background characters personalities from minor details like that.
<p></p>It's not as if the Mane Cast don't have personality specified attire or physical attributes either. eg. AJ's cowgirl attire,  Rarity's glossy feminine makeup and hairstyle.

            I have nothing against a character with mental quirks having physical quirks.
<p></p>I'm just peeved that people ONLY saw her physical quirks then just ASSUMED that she had mental quirks as well. They don't ALWAYS come together.
<p></p>I'm mostly annoyed at people who consider Derpy stupid (which is a LOT of people,  even if they aren't here)

Clumsy,  but not stupid,  and always loving and caring. And beyond that i'm pretty sure 70% of the airhead stuff is more based on the blonde ness then the wall-eyed-ness,  the clumsyness yeah that's mostly from the eyes. let's see stuff whre Derpy is played the way you say she never is

            Can we get back to the character episode discussion again? I don't think this is heading a good place.
<p></p>Just to note I wasn't making fun of people with wall eyes in real life. It's just something that gets utilized in cartoons that way.

<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> They would definitely have to do a Luna/Celestia episode some time or another - it just seems inevitable,  especially with the themes of friendship in this show.

            I had Derpy in 'Rarity'; she was a bit rough around the edges,  but hardly stupid:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">The next day there was a knock on the front door. I opened it to find Derpy,  the resident mailmare standing there,  her saddlebags polished to a sheen,  her postal hat perched on her windblown blonde mane and gently tied beneath her chin to keep it on.
<p></p>On anypony else this would just look silly,  but Derpy is quite good at her job,  despite her tendency to be scatterbrained from time to time; for instance that one time when she delivered one of Twilight’s books a bit too literally – she was told to ‘drop it off’ and she did. From ten or fifteen feet up; something which Twilight still hasn’t quite forgiven her for - so it’s generally overlooked. Anyway,  to be honest it’s rather cute on her.
<p></p>“I gotta special letter for you,  ma’am. I’d have just put it in the box like the other stuff,  but I was told to deliver it straight t’you.” She rooted around in her saddlebag. “Now where’re you...Ah,  <em>here</em> it is...” She carefully pulled out a golden-sheened envelope. I accepted the envelope from her,  which smelled slightly of roses.
<p></p>“Thank you,  Derpy, ” I replied. The mailmare nodded smartly and took to the air.</div>
