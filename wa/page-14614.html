<p></p>I recall those Twitter messages around the time of the episode,  ad it really struck me as a "wink wink" thing. They never said it in as many words,  and really only pointed out the detail itself. So I feel free to interpret it however.

            It's just a freaking shooting star.
<p></p>But everyone else seems to have latched onto it being significant right away,  so maybe I'm just the weird one who doesn't think it means that (or means anything)

            It's not just a shooting star. The fact that there are two of them and they appear right after they say something about the whole family being there makes it pretty clear that it's not coincidence. And then they appear again at the end of the episode.

            I didn't get the symbolism until it was pointed out.
<p></p>But I do believe that's what they were shooting for.

            @Enlong: Law of Conservation of Detail.  We've never seen shooting stars in episodes before (at least,  not that weren't the focus,  like that scene in 'Owl's Well'),  the stars were paired,  and they showed up during a soulful glance out the window after a mention of a family reunion.

            They died when a couple of meteorites fell from the sky and clonked them on the head.  And now whenever Applejack sees a shooting star,  she's reminded of her parents.

            @Enlong: I won't begrudge you for thinking it's not important,  but my personal feeling is that it's not just coincidental.
<p></p>Like story says,  the timing of the stars and the dialogue is really dead on,  and there was way too much emphasis for those stars to just be a random background detail. If one kinda streaked by quickly while the scene was happening,  I would have thought nothing of it (Happens often enough),  but the fact that they stop for a second just to let Applejack watch TWO of them go by at that exact moment feels too significant.

            Actually,  since Apple Bloom is the youngest,  it would have to have been shortly after she was born.
<p></p>...Hm... Okay,  yeah,  them being dead is the <em>more</em> comforting possibility.
