            I'm sure pigeons just don't need all that much in the first place. Or they've adapted very well,  or get their food elsewhere. Or they just die,  that's also a possibility. Daft things.

            I think it's just the way they're shaped. Who knows.
<p></p>There's actually a lot of CROWS in my city,  more than pigeons. A couple of them built a nest outside my window,  it's fun to watch them sometimes. The eggs haven't hatched yet,  but I hope they do before I move.

            I like those birds I don't understand why people call them  flying rats.  I never heard anybody in Poland comparing pigeons too rats.
<p></p>I once place I live I can see pigeons nest from window.  Not cool as Phoenixes but still nice to see.

            I think people compare them to rats because they sort of infest cities,  just like rats.  I am amused by how bold they are... if you run after one a lot of times they will just walk away really fast.. not even bothering to fly.  Its like they know you aren't going to do anything to them (I really shouldnt give them that much credit though! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">)

            They're very,  very dirty birds,  and very prevalent. The comparison to rats means just that: Dirty and everywhere. Several human races have been compared to rats at one point or another.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> Generally in that they don't react to danger,  or people at all. When people come close they just sort of get out of the way. Sometimes they don't even do that. <em>I've</em> stepped aside for pigeons more than once.
<p></p>Which is an interesting bit of narcissism on our part,  that we consider the fact that something isn't afraid of us a sign of its stupidity.

            I don't particularly hate them. My father used to raise them.
<p></p>Hawks love them after a rainy season.

            They don't run away from people because they are feeding them,  or it's in my country?
