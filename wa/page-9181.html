            The point is that <strong>nobody is convincing anyone of anything</strong>. So this protracted "discussion" is just getting wearisome for everyone.

            On my Dark Souls progress,  I ran out of Humanity to summon guys with. So I've started again to get a feel of the different playstyles so I can make a decision on what to focus on. Right now I'm being a Sorcerer. I like having a ranged option but the charge times leave something to be desired. I got a cutlass from a skeleton so I'll buff up my dexterity a bit to use that as my back up in case I run out of magic.

            <span class="blue">@badwolfwho: That's a good idea actually.  I think everyone does a lot of things wrong the first time they play the game,  after a few hours of experience it's better to start over with a clean slate.  Even as a sorcerer though,  you're definitely still going to need to do phsyical combat from time to time.  So did you ever get past those Gargoyles?  If you get stuck on them again there's an easier,  optional boss in the forest (just past the blacksmith) you can go fight first if you want.  Actually,  you don't <em>have</em> to fight the gargoyles at all until much later.</span>

            <span class="blue">@badwolfwho: If you go down the elevator beneath Firelink Shrine (it's open right from the beginning) and go down the New Londo Ruins,  there's a blacksmith there who can forge your weapon into a Magic Weapon,  meaning it gains bonus damage from your intelligence instead of your str or dex.  Good for a magic class.  You'll have to find him more embers to make it happen though.</span>

            One of my mistakes was using all my Humanity immediately then losing most of it.
<p></p>Nah,  I didn't get past them. I met the thunder thing,  he seemed harder since I couldn't negate all his attacks with my shield. I ended up running past him to explore the next area until I found the area full of golems and the door that had the knight in it that could OHKO me. Oh and the elevator that led to the small dragons. I could take those if their hitpoints weren't so massive.
<p></p>This will make it easier to fight that first Black Knight since I can spam magic from above at him. I also found a Blacksmith near the start who gave me Advanced Spell Arrows.

            Wait,  what's the problem exactly? Sure it was rash and violent but somewhat an expected and rather human reaction for having some drunken jerk attempt to wreck your property,  I mean it's not like you hospitalized him,  right?

            True,  but it was a rash action propelled by anger,  I'm not condoning it,  but it makes sense to me. When you're angry rational retribution is not exactly on the mind.

<p></p>context extends beyond a single sentence. If the person speaking has not already made it clear if they're talking about a group or a single person,  then there's other problems.

            <span class="blue">@badwolfwho: Actually he can upgrade up to Magic +5 from the start,  but you'll need blue titanite to do it.  You'll find it around,  also the crystal golems in the forest drop them but I'd suggest just playing through normally until you find them.  Once you get to Magic +5 though,  you need the Magic Ember to go higher,  which is found deep in the Darkroot Forest.  You can access the forest almost immediately,  but the area the Ember is in is a pretty high leveled spot so I wouldn't suggest going in it right now unless you just try and run past everyone.  There's really no need for you to get it yet anyway since you won't have enough blue titanite to upgrade that high.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">You should definitely make sure to upgrade your weapons and armor when you can though,  doing so can actually make a bigger difference than leveling up your character.</span>
