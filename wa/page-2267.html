            I probably would have read Fallout Equestria,  but I tend to not care for original characters in fics plus I was turned off by the Chrono Cross-esque revelations of what happened to the Mane Six.

            to be fair. From the sounds of it,  the fic DOES uphold the morals of the show. It just puts them through the most horrific of tests. I'm not completely averse to the concept (I LOVE <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Earn Your Happy Ending</a> as a trope) but I just don't want it mixing with THIS series. I come here for unshakable optimism. If that's your kind of thing,  then I'll reccomend it. It must be doing SOMETHING right if it's become so beloved.
<p></p>For me personally,  knowing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Diamond Tiara commits suicide in it</span> turned me off the fic ENTIRELY. It's exactly the sort of thing I DIDN'T want to see.

<p></p>I really don't understand how people can justify what the Mane Six did. IT'S A TERRIBLE PLAN,  and really should have ended in disaster if it weren't for the fact that RD had more faith in her friends then apparently they did (it really makes their whole plan seem unnecessary and mean-spirited).

            I think the issue the mane cast had was,  yes,  RD is egotistical ALL the fucking time,  but before now she wasn't really in a position of responsibility. She wasn't the town's hero,  or a large scale role model. (she had a fan club sure,  but it was relatively small scale) She became BOTH of those things in Mare Do Well. THAT'S what they had an issue with .If you're gonna go around and be considered a paragon of heroism,  you just CAN'T have that kind of attitude.
<p></p>AJ said: "A true <strong>hero</strong> doesn't brag."
<p></p>The mane cast can put up with RD's egotism normally,  but they took specific issue with her here because of the CIRCUMSTANCES around it.
<p></p>that's my theory anyway

            Also,  RD was flying her swelled head HIGH into the sky and she was NOT coming down.
<p></p>I've said it before,  but if you intend to be a hero or an athlete,  then you NEED to get it in your head that there will ALWAYS be someone out there who will out do you. Imagine if RD's egotism had been left unchecked,  and mare do well showed up in a few years,  except she was REAL,  and not played by her friends.
<p></p>They were giving her a dose of reality sooner rather than later because she NEEDED to get that lesson in her head. Her eventual breakdown would've only been WORSE (and possibly dangerous) if it happened any later than it did

<p></p>Remember how you said in the discussion of Secret of My Excess how you found Rarity's desire for Spike's birthday present personally offensive. This is kind of the same thing with me. Having been on the receiving end of "lessons" delivered in a similar manner,  I get very cross when characters in a show decide to go that route. To me <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughLove" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughLove">Tough Love</a> has always been an excuse for people to do terrible things to each other and have them justified,  and from personal experience I have found that these sort of secretive "lessons" don't do a good job of actually teaching,  but instead bred mis-trust and contempt.
<p></p>I still think the fact that RD took it so well in the end means that the plan really wasn't necessary. Big ego or not they didn't have to dress up in order to convey their message they could have just gone as themselves to rescue the other ponies,  and I think it would have worked much better.

            I think there's also the fact that,  really,  these ponies know each other better than we do. At least under certain circumstances. These are friends that are apparently so close they can wield the elements of Harmony. Plus,  RD isn't exactly the most complex character. I think they knew how she'd react,  and trusted her to make the right decision in the end.

            Let me guess Mousa,  you see in Rarity negative traits of yourself being reflected by her.
<p></p>I know that feel,  bro. I still like her because I can empathise with her artist's struggles that are portrayed so convincingly.

            Oh man,  <em>that</em> is going to be epic.  I've always wanted an episode where Pinkie has to be the responsible one...
<p></p>Anyway,  as far as the Mare-Do-Well goes,  my two main problems were 1. Ponyville as a setting just seemed off in that episode,  and 2. while I think the mane cast's plan was semi-justified,  they jumped to it way too quickly.  There needed to be a scene where they simply tried to talk RD down,  and failed so the more extreme measures were justified.  If you want a more detailed look at what I thought of the episode,  read <a class="urllink" href="http://japaneseteeth.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4hmwps">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
<p></p>@Ginger: Hey,  this sets her up to finally be the pony who has to learn a lesson about responsibility.  I'd have thought you'd be all over this idea.
