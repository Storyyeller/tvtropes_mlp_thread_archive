            We do know,  a part of her did this willingly. Evidenced by the fact that she had to apologize and that  she was scared of facing Celestia,  not to mention the guilt.

            I don't think we can just say that she was completedly possesed,  because what end would eternal night serve anyone but Luna? You can see why Luna wanted it,  for people to appreciate her night,  but what purpose doesit serve anyone else? Well,  I suppose that would be an issue to reveal in time.
<p></p>I think she probably just chose to accept the help of something,  and that's what she was apologizing for. It was still her choice,  no matter how badly it went against her wishes.

            I think it wouldbe fair to say that Celestia over-reacted - or she couldn't quite control the power of the elements. The reason was that Luna refused to lower the moon - she wanted eternal night. She might have lashed out at Celestia,  but that's probably the extent of it.
<p></p>Does anybody else think seeing the actual thing,  as an actual episode,  would be amazing to see?

            I think it just made her more powerful and a lot more selfish. Neither full possesion,  nor something whispering in her ear. It just changed her personality a little. She could have stopped if she wanted to. Thing is,  after becoming Nightmare Moon she <strong>didn't</strong> want to.

            ^^I would love to,  actually.  It'd be a good way to develop Celestia's character.
<p></p>^Makes sense to me.  It's worth noting that Luna gets shrunk back to a much smaller alicorn once she gets turned back into Luna... maybe <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">Gods Need Prayer Badly</a>...?
<p></p>Anyway,  anyone else think Luna should be up for <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>?  I get the feeling she didn't think her plan through very well (that is,  <em>if</em> it was Luna and not Nightmare Moon calling the shots even back then; I doubt Nightmare would care very much either way whether there were any ponies left in Equestria),  and all she really wanted was the same kind of love and respect that her sister got.

I would prefer little flashbacks about their lives leading up to the event,  and leave us to put the pieces together about what happened in our minds.
<p></p>Oh you know what would be great?  If they told the stories of Celestia's early years in the styles of each of the other My Little Pony animated series.

<p></p>The standing theory for that is that Luna became Nightmare Moon,  <em>she wasn't Luna anymore</em> and stopped aging as her.

Is it really that dark to say that not all apologies are sincere?  That's actually how I explain the quick turn-arounds some of the villains go through at the ends of the G1 cartoons,  that it wasn't a change of heart so much as they were just tired of fighting and considered it too risky to continue the battle,  so they started buttering up the ponies as it's easy to get back on their good side.
