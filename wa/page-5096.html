            Something I've always wondered... with <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transformers" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transformers">Transformers</a>,  are there tons of recolors and random characters in the toys that never appear in the show,  and some jarring inaccuracies with characters that do? Has Optimus Prime ever been,  say,  pink?
<p></p>I know that slowly but surely we're getting ponies from the show as toys,  but Hasbro for the most part just makes up random ponies for their toyline. I suspect when they were planning to reboot <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a>,  they went and trademarked a bunch of random names that could be used for toys,  which is why we had so many non-show ponies in the toys for a long time.
<p></p>Makes me wonder what Hasbro's plan for <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a> is going forward...

<p></p>1. Your right it's a YMMV issue which means there is no right or wrng answer,  just opinion of which your is just as valid regardless of how many agree with you
<p></p>2. from looking around I do not think your in as small a majority as you think when it comes to that.

            @Ginger: I read the discussion on accents (which is a topic I'm a bit obsessed with,  too bad I missed it).  Would this guy be a good example of a Welsh accent:
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiIGOeQNIDQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiIGOeQNIDQ<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<p></p>It's a video of someone talking about Welsh stereotypes.  And the idea of Rarity being Welsh,  I would like very much.  It's not an accent many Americans seem to be familiar with,  so having it on a popular cartoon would be a good way to familiarize American children with it.  I remember when I was little,  the only place I could find a Welsh accent was one little clip on a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerMouse" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerMouse">Danger Mouse</a> episode and I would have LOVED it if <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a> had a major character with that accent.  I kind of wish they did have more noticeable accents amongst the Mane Cast besides just the Apple family (I do like their Southern accented speech) and the fake upperclass accent Rarity has,  but that would probably just be something that appeals to me and wouldn't necessarily make the show better for everyone.
<p></p>I wonder if any of the dragons in the next story will have any different accents,  to signify that they're migrating from different regions?

            @Bluespade: Um...No. We've had plenty of insight on the effect of their world being different.
<p></p>@JT: As always,  perfect. I also prefer Pinkie's wackiness to stick to her personality. But I also have a tendancy to treat everything that's shown as totally canon,  so my personality refuses to let me ignore her powers. Therefore,  I just want them to be consistant. I like consistancy.

            @Seraphem: I guess I just wish that the animation industry here in the U.S would finally move past the Golden Age. Yes they were funny,  and when they were brought back in the nineties they were also funny,  but at this point I am sick and tired of animators feeling that that is the only way to do things. All Pinkie Pie shows to me is that they could have done something creative,  but instead they feel back on ole reliable,  because they are to wrapped up in the nostalgia of yore.
<p></p>But yeah. My opinion.

<p></p>Yeah,  it needs to move forward.  I remember when <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> became a big deal,  was really popular and made lots of money.  I waited for other studios to come forward and try and do the same thing,  figuring we'd see a bit of a surge of story-driven,  plot-focused animation.  It never happened.  Well,  there was the Thundercats reboot,  but it unfortunately wasn't good.

<p></p>I don't like Pinkie being treated as a Looney Toon. I like her being treated as more like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter">Luna Lovegood</a> (ie. her differences from oter ponies cause her more problems than they solve,  but she remaind sweet regardless). Giving her such an easy time undermines her character and is the reason that she's the least favourite of the mane six despite the fact that I love similar characters (like Luna Lovegood).

            I love the golden age animation,  but the issue is that it doesn't work as well unless the <em>whole</em> setting follows those rules.  Bugs Bunny doesn't work if the entire setting apart from him is realistic.  Unless that's the point of the story.
<p></p>Really,  it's almost miraculous that the writers incorporated Pinkie Pie as well as they did.  Although I certainly agree that she's at her best when the humor is personality based rather than slapstick.  The physical humor certainly does work sometimes,  but it's not completely reliable.

            I have no problem with Pinkie being the only loony toon.  I actually think it's a great idea,  I just didn't like how it was done for most of the show.  I seem to be warming up to her now (though she still annoys me fairly often).

Pinkie is the writers making a very well done homage to that time becuase it's what they grew up with and loved as kids,  not becuase it's what they think will be popular.

<p></p>that being said,  knowing your tastes,  you might wanna try again,  but this time just skip season 1,  except maybe the finale,  and go with season 2,  that's when Azula shows up.
