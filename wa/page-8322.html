<p></p>Wrong! Pinkie Pie's favorite has to be one of those birthday cake flavors. Also,  apple flavored icecream does exist,  though normally,  it's a type of apple,  like cinnamon apple or caramel apple flavored. I don't think there's anything like plain uncooked apple flavored.

            <span class="blue">Oh,  I see.... Do you have a job?  Do you work with people (either customers or coworkers)?  If so,  I suggest just continuously practicing chatting with them throughout the day.  The customers will leave so what they think of you doesn't really matter,  and it it'll get you to be more comfortable talking with strangers.  It worked for me,  I used to be so painfully shy that calling my <em>best friend</em> on the phone actually made me feel physically ill.  But being outgoing/talkative whatever is a skill like anything else,  you have to practice it.</span>

            yeah i work,  and no I don't really have anyone I can just talk to..or at least that i feel i can. Doesn't help i'm one of the department managers,  so most of them do nothing but shit on me when they think I'm not able to hear because they all think they know better how to run things...and the ones that don't,  well not a lot of overlap in interests between 30 year old male and a group of females in there late 40's to 50's which is damn near all that work there. (other then a few guys that are still better part of a decade to either side and are the ones that spend more time bitching about me behind my back then listening to me)
<p></p>Costumers..i have no issue dealing with them on a professional level, i just can't ever reach out to anyone on a personal level.

            Seraphem - Not great advice,  but I find myself a little more open to meeting and talking to new people after a drink or two.  I have always suspected myself of having Mild Aspergers but have never sought diagnosis since I dont want to use it as a crutch.
<p></p>Another thing you can do if you play games a lot.. if your guild has a vent server just get on there and talk to people... it can help prime you for dealing with real folks.
