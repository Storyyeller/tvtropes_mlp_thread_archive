Actually,  it works out because Perception is a skill based on knowing what to pay attention to. Everyone's ears probably picked up a slight crunching sound,  but the older dude with the high perception is likely the first one to take notice (and probably warn the rest of the team to keep an eye out for ambushes).

            To be fair,  I miss a good deal of the morning insanity due to the same.
<p></p>Okay,  so the EP's still get racial skills,  they just get them at higher levels rather than starting with them like the Pegasi and Unicorns do? That makes sense,  I guess. the initial bonus is then to make them viable at early levels until they get to the good levels.
<p></p>...I'm actually really kinda excited for this. I've always wanted to try a real RPG type-thing,  I hope we actually manage to do this instead of just letting the idea peter out.

No,  now I wish I thread-hopped more,  because an old post of Kegisak's has got me stuck on wondering what it would be like to be naturally strong,  and I can't even remember how we got on that topic.

            <em>Kegisak's has got me stuck on wondering what it would be like to be naturally strong</em>
<p></p>It's actually really weird. Like,  I'm naturally a very big and strong person,  but... I don't feel like it. I don't really have the frame of reference for <em>not</em> being able to do the shit I do. In fact,  I actually feel very <em>small</em> a lot of the time,  until you set me next to someone.
<p></p>It only ever really comes through in very specific things. If I had to lift something someone <em>else</em> might think I was strong,  but I wouldn't because to me it would be fairly easy. It doesn't necessarily make it difficult to <em>control</em> my strength,  but it does make it hard to measure how much I need to use. I've almost thrown things before because someone else has told me it was heavy. That's part of what made me a pacifist; It's <em>very</em> easy for me to accidentally hurt people if,  say,  I were to go for a friendly pat on the back and it felt more like a wallop. I tend to try and avoid touching people so that I don't accidentally hit them too hard.
<p></p>So yeah... being naturally strong is very strange. There's a reason lots of big guys are really gentle.

            I think certain exercises might be hard for me just due to mental blocks.  Like during heavy lifting,  the feel of strong resistance throws me into this fear that at any moment some part of <em>me</em> could get broken off.  Then when it's over,  I hate the lingering rubbery feeling so much that I swear never to let myself feel like that again.  Similarly,  I could never get any good at swimming or tumbling,  just because my mind can't accept throwing my body to the mercy of gravity.
<p></p>Sometimes I can get it to work the other way,  though,  and develop fake "endurance" through the thought process of "Ignoring the pain makes me feel like I'm doing something awesome!"
