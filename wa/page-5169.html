<p></p>@ start: Rainbow!  No...means...<em>no!</em>. Good for you FS.  Stand your ground.  Also...you so cute!
<p></p>Anyway,  although I enjoyed this episode...I can't call it spectacular.  There was some interesting parts,  but nothing really jumped out at me.
<p></p>I <em>did</em> love Spike and Rarity in it though.  Rarity was at her best once again.

            @Fallen: I think Navi's annoyingness got blown out of proportion.  She's aggravating,  but there are way worse helpers out there.

            Yeah,  I never took any real issue with Navi. Then again,  I didn't react to anything in that game like people expected. I didn't find the water temple at all confusing,  and it's certainly not the best I've ever seen.
<p></p>It's a very middle-of-the-line game as far as I'm concerned. Not <em>bad</em> but not spectacular. I really liked the spirit temple,  though.
<p></p>and I HATED jabu-jabu.

It makes him really hard to take seriously,  because it isn't a cool one like <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatMouseDetective" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatMouseDetective">Rattigan's</a>,  where he flips out and goes for the kill. He just starts... flailing and screaming and generally acting like a little kid.

            About the latest episode,  I thought it was very interesting from a sociological perspective.  There was definitely <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> going on between the dragon culture (or at least the culture of that group of teenage dragons) versus the pony culture that Spike knows,  and it also comes down very strong on the nurture side of the nature vs. nurture debate.  There also seemed to be a message of "it's okay for a male to hang out with girls and do traditionally girly things" with the way Spike decided he preferred the pony culture to the macho dragons,  which is probably also a metaphor for the brony fans versus other males who would mock them for liking cutesy ponies.  While it would have been nice to see a dragon with a more obviously nice personality,  that would have made it potentially harder for Spike to decide to stay with the ponies,  and might raise even more potential <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>.  Also,  the fact that the other dragons were too brutal for Spike's tastes makes it also a callback to the old G1 story with pretty much the same plot.  That old episode even had Spike making friends with a bird!
<p></p>And as Ginger and some others noted,  the dragons weren't all mean.  They had high standards for being tough enough to hang out with them,  but they still accepted Spike as part of their group.  As for the phoenix eggs,  Ginger has a good point that these aren't ordinary bird eggs,  they're phoenix eggs.  Spike wouldn't have necessarily known this,  but smashing one wouldn't necessarily kill the baby inside.  It could,  at worst,  simply injure it,  or even make it hatch and the dragons would have an angry baby phoenix to deal with.  In fact,  that could have been part of the "game, " to fight something that even as a baby could still burn a dragon.  And even if it did kill the egg,  there would still be the angry parents to deal with.
<p></p>As a final note,  I think my favorite part of the story was Fluttershy showing that "no means no" at the beginning.  Especially because that was the new "catchphrase" that Iron Will learned from her.
