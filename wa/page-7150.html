            you know,  it wierd,  we never really see Celstia or Luna go flying around alot,  pretty much the few times they ever use there wings they're just hovering a few feet of the ground,  or slowly gliding in for a landing. Wonder how there arial abilities stack up to full pegasi.

            The changelings,  at least the ones I was up against,  were pretty good fliers. I underestimated them thinking that they would fall for some petty tricks,  like flying towards a wall and changing directions at the last second in the hopes they would crash.

            @Seraph Hmmmmmm,  I'm not sure. I don't think they'd bother practicing their flying all that often (since they can teleport) but given that they seem to represent the pinnacle of the three races,  I bet they have a lot of innate flying ability.
<p></p>We just haven't seen them in a position where they need to use it yet

            Their insect like wings look more fragile,  though. I suspect that unless they use magic they can't match a pegasus going near top speed.

            Well,  my theory is that since the Sister share traits of all three,  it also means the increased durability and hardiness or EP's,  I figure the extra mass from that kinda interferes with them flying as well as the lighter Pegasi. Though once they got up to speed they'd bash through anything in there path.

            Maybe Celestia doesn't like to involve herself in problems that could be solved by ponies alone. So that they don't get complacent that they can do whatever they want and Celestia will save them.

            @Bad That's what I figured,  yeah.

            Pinkie just knows how to find shortcuts,  Dashie is speed and style,  and AJ is strong enough to do stunts her friends just can't even try.
<p></p>As for Celestia and the dragons,  it might imply that there's a senior dragon-lord around.

            Yeah she doesn't want to escalate things. Nightmare Moon,  Discord and Chrysalis were all extremely powerful and by them making the first move she's allowed to step in. But if she steps in against a normal dragon that could be seen as excessive retribution and could motivate more powerful dragons to move against her. Alternatively by showing that any dragon can get her personal attention so easily it would make the dragons seem more important than her.
<p></p>And the conversation has shifted.
