            Also,  if Celestia had tried to flee,  then she would've been admitting to The Queen that she was weaker than her (because  if she was stronger,  then surely she would've stuck around to fight)
<p></p>and if Tia left to get the elements and managed to evade The Queen,  then Chris could've easily taken one or many of the party guests hostage

            @Apple That's my point,  I don't think they COULD'VE reached the elements,  they were set up to fail by Celestia just to make the queen cocky.

            I don't quite think they were set up to fail; yeah actually getting the elements was a long shot,  but the alternate plan in that situation is...what?  There wasn't exactly a lot else that they could have attempted at that point.

<p></p>Which is why it makes more sense for Celestia to have planned the eventually outcome. Why else send them on a mission doomed to fail rather then have them evacuate as many people as possible and re-group with Luna outside the city?

            Again,  I think the queen knew about the elements,  and if Celestia hadn't at least adressed them (sending the cast to get them) in that situation,  then the Queen might've gotten incredibly suspicious and might think that they were hiding them somewhere else.
<p></p>By sending them off like that,  and handing the Queen a vitory,  she's making the queen feel all the more sure that she's won.
