            <div class="quoteblock">Upon reflection,  I think it's rather telling that more people got up in a tizzy about Babs' redemption than Trixie's.
<p></p>Or at least,  more people got vocally upset. </div>
<p></p>Eh.  The problem with Babs was not only that it's a thing that actually happens to people and skews their entire outlook for the rest of their lives (and will thus be a powderkeg no matter what),  but also that it felt like a huge copout with the whole "oh she's not <em>really</em> a bully,  and fake bullies just need love".  Which grates even more in the context of cartoons on the whole rarely if ever acknowledging that kids can be bad apples at all,  much less deliver a decent and very much-needed moral about it to the kids who need it <em>right now</em>.
<p></p>With Trixie,  not only do you have the abstraction-from-reality of an impossible scenario and the  double standard that it's okay to have adult villains,  but it was also pretty clear that she really was an asshole,  didn't get a free pass because she had issues (at least that weren't her fault in the first place),  and got better specifically because she got put in her place,  and then most importantly,  <em>sought forgiveness herself</em> (which Twilight was visibly hesitant to give at all and just wound up being enough of a bro to do so) instead of having it handed to her on a platter.  From a writing standpoint it was a less divisive scenario in the first place and just plain pulled off better on top of it — it felt rushed,  but not a complete omission.

<p></p>I really can't agree with that. To me the apology seems to come out of nowhere and does not seem to stem from the events of the rest of the episode. I know that the amulet was supposed to be corrupting her,  but her actions and demeanor seemed to change little before she put it on,  and even after she took it off.

            @Mio: Admitedly it bugs me that even long after she took off the amulet,  she's still in evil laughing tyrant mode. It's only when they start cheering Twilight and she suddenly just backs down dumbfounded we see a change in mood.
<p></p>Come to think of it,  it was a bit odd the ponies weren't even the slightest bit vengeful about it when she was depowered,  especially since they likely had no knowledge she was brainwashed.
