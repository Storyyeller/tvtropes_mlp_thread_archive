            I had a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> concerning Applejack's suspicion of Zecora in Bridle Gossip.  Given the way she acted about the Everfree Forest,  she probably was most scared of Zecora simply because of where she lived.  And I realized that it makes perfect sense that Applejack,  of all the Mane Six,  would have a distrust of the forest.  As a farmer,  her livelihood involves "taming" the land and the crops and the animals.  It wouldn't really count as agriculture for someone to just let the crops and animals go wherever they wanted to,  like in the Everfree Forest.  The way the forest works is completely opposite to the structured lifestyle Applejack is used to!  Plus the fact that she had some scary experiences in the Everfree Forest,  not only in the pilot but with the poison joke would add to her dislike of that place.  Given all that,  I looked at it from Applejack's point of view and realized that she was being quite reasonable,  in her point of view,  to forbid Apple Bloom from going into the forest.  When I first saw the episode,  I hated the way Applejack treated her sister because of my dislike for the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotNowKiddo" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotNowKiddo">Not Now, Kiddo</a> trope,  but in this case,  while Zecora may not be dangerous,  there are OTHER things in the forest that most definitely are and that could easily eat Apple Bloom.  That same knowledge of the dangers present in the forest would also go for the other five members of the Mane Cast as well.
<p></p>This came out of me thinking about Applejack being my favorite of the Mane Six,  and how even a trait of hers that I found annoying earlier (her being dismissive and overprotective of her sister) ended up being more understandable when I looked at the situation from Applejack's point of view.  So thinking about that made her position as my favorite even more certain (that's not to say that she doesn't have flaws,  it's just that the flaws she does have don't really take away from my opinion of her character).
<p></p>I also was thinking about how Apple Bloom,  in that episode,  didn't care what others said about Zecora and was willing to be friendly with her,  but later on,  her fear of Diamond Tiara's bullying made her more afraid of what others think about her.  I wonder if there would ever be a story where Apple Bloom's friendship with Zecora would come into conflict with her fear of Diamond Tiara's bullying?

            Actually,  it seems like Chi-blocking is actually pretty painful,  considering most characters it's used on <em>scream</em> when it happens. and even if it wasn't,  most decent people would <em>still</em> think twice about doing it to a kid.
<p></p>Plus a precision technique is <em>really</em> difficult to use on someone small,  particularly when they practice a martial art <em>dedicated</em> to mobility.

            @Rainbow: In all honesty I think their general fear of Zecora was a lot more warranted than a lot of people make it out to be.  Not that they're totally innocent by any means,  but looking at things from their point of view,  it wasn't illogical to be at least a little creeped out.
