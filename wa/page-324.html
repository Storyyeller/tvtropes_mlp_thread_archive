            Awwww,  crud. The same day as I start writing a "Nightmare Sun" story,  one is posted on Equestria Daily. It's an obvious enough concept that I figured someone had already done it,  but it's still a little disheartening. Amusingly/depressingly,  more than one commenter mentions working on similar stories...

<p></p>About the Elements.
<p></p>I'd give Air to Rainbow dash for the whole Equestria's best flier thing.
<p></p>Fluttershy or Applejack could get nature. Fluttershy for the animals and Applejack for the trees,  I'd lean towards Fluttershy though.
<p></p>Earth would be good for Applejack since like her it's sturdy and dependable.
<p></p>The others seem trickier,  Rarity could have Ice since ice is generally pretty and delicate I dunno.
<p></p>Twilight set on fire and was taught by Celestia who oversees the sun,  which is also on fire so she could have fire,  maybe.
<p></p>Pinkie Pie's hair is really poofy,  electricity makes your hair stand on end,  so she could have Lightning. Plus she's good friends with Rainbow Dash and Lightning and Air would go together.

<p></p>So,  what? Have you missed me completely gushing over Soarin' every time he's brought up? Okay,  granted,  most of it is focused on his VA,  but that's a pretty huge part of any cartoon character,  especially considering I immedeately decided on Soarin's personality upon hearing it.

            My favourite background pony is probably Doctor Whoof/ves since Trixie and Luna won't count.

            I'm not sure I have a favorite background pony,  it would probably be Derpy (because her origin amuses me too) or Vinyl Scratch (because I like her design,  and the post above mine reminded me).
<p></p>The first I really saw of Rarity was "Suited For Success" (since she only showed up in "Fall Weather Friends" for like two seconds) and I thought she was pretty cool.

            Probably because of the way her personality does a 180 when she's working; she absolutely loves what she does and all she wants to do is give the others <em>exactly what they want</em> despite the fact that they keep asking for revisions and she's being worn down by them. And she doesn't complain at all; she just keeps trying,  even though she thinks what they're asking for is not what she should be giving them. <em>They come first and foremost</em>.

<p></p>In other news,  I tried to do a from-the-ground-up rewrite of my fanfic,  and I think this time its turning out a lot better,  but I do have some doubts about it.  I'm almost done re-writing chapter two,  so I'll post some links when I'm done.

<p></p>Yeah I was being kind of silly about heart.
<p></p>The problem with making "Nature" an element is that,  Earth fire wind and water are all parts of nature,  so its redundant (and a little weird,  since you're saying its on equal standing with the things that are a part of it).  Because of this,  its also way too vague an element.
<p></p>The four classical elements pretty much cover everything.  I've seen some <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGs">RP Gs</a> that cheat by casting "Light" and "Dark" as elements.  Problematically "Dark" usually has evil intonations,  though this doesn't have to be the case (<em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretOfMana" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretOfMana">Secret of Mana</a></em> is an example where it doesn't,  or at least its not explicitly bound to the forces of evil).  If you wanna go with that though,  Light fits Fluttershy and Dark fits Twilight Sparkle.
<p></p>I've seen some other "cheap" elements too.  Here's a quick list:
<p></p><ul><li> Metal
</li><li> Plastic
</li><li> Technology
</li><li> Spirit
</li><li> "Pure" Magic (ie non-elemental)
</li></ul>

<p></p>I was actually gonna have Twilight get light but refuse,  she'd think it was too all encompassing and wanted to be on equal footing with her friends (she doesn't like to outshine people) and darkness was gonna be Trixie's element

            Okay,  so I had an idea for my fanfic - not the next chapter,  but a slightly later chapter,  one which would add backstory to my bland <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs">O Cs</a>.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">A unicorn mare has given birth,  but the foal isn't moving or breathing. Both of the parents are devastated. Quietly,  the mother nudges the foal,  and it stirs,  breathing weakly. It doesn't cry. Relieved and overjoyed,  the parents name him Phoenix.
<p></p>Brownie is lost on the way home from school. A police officer pony helps her cross the street. She likes him. He helps her find her way home. Her parents thank him,  and he goes on his way. She never sees him again,  but remembers him. She'd like to be like him.
<p></p>A pegasus couple is moving out of their home in the clouds. They have adopted an earth pony,  and she won't be able to live there. They don't mind,  though. They'll care for her like they should. They meet the filly. She sees their wings and wishes that she could fly.
<p></p>A family of unicorns is packing up a wagon. The parents can't afford to live in the house anymore,  and they need to find someplace else to work. They pack up some furniture,  food,  and a few spare belongings. The youngest one,  Gold Standard,  has a stuffed bear.
<p></p>Ritardando enters into a music contest. His special talent is music. So is everypony else's. His hastily-constructed,  under-rehearsed one-pony band show does not impress the judges. The contest is won by a unicorn who can magically produce the sound of a fifty-piece orchestra.
<p></p>Raincloud wants her mother to read her a story. A new one,  in a book she just found at the library. Her mother is hesitant to read the story,  but she insists. It's about a foal that searches and searches for her parents,  and then,  at the end,  comes to a grave. Raincloud cries. She is very upset.</div>
<p></p>Chapter would continue like this. Past events in present tense.

            About the elements thing,  I'd be inclined to say:
Lightning = Dashie for her showy speed demon tendencies
'Nature' (or the 6th equivalent if you decide to change it) = Fluttershy
Air = Pinkie Pie for her tendency toward randomness
Earth = Applejack as she's often the most down to earth
<p></p>I'm a little iffier on Rarity and Twilight,  I'd probably place them as:
Ice = Rarity
Fire = Twilight
