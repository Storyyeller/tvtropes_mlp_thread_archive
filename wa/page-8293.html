            @psi yeah that's true. But don't forget that she got her focus episodes at the beginning of the season (wich harmed her a bit) and even then people argued that those weren't extactly her fault.
<p></p>But it is pretty old news now<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">. I think she has developed alot since then

            @Fallen: I think the thing was that RD had the larger amount of spotlight episodes in Season Two,  and as such more moments were required to focus on her flaws and make her act up. In comparison AJ had the least in Season Two,  but arguably the most in Season One (shared with others anyway).

<p></p>Though i never understood...well i understood but never agreed with...the hate she got for MTBPW,  seemed perfectly fine to and in character for her to me.
<p></p>ummm Sky,  each pony pretty much had the same amount,  they all got 2 episodes for themselves and usually one other they shared with another.

            I thought MTBPW was fine too,  the only bit I thought was a bit cruel was the poor dejected falcon at the end.
<p></p>Maybe RD stands out because she's the more likely of the mane cast to act out and out selfish rather than having at least some well intentions. MMDW is a good example,  and unlike other episodes,  she doesn't really redeem herself,  she just gets the lesson rammed into her head. She has plenty of redeeming moments otherwise however.

            I can see why her actions in MTBPW might be construed as jerkish,  but I think it gets wildly exaggerated.

<p></p>AJ had 2 on her own and Sisterhooves was partly her so 2.5.

<p></p>Yeah that's true. But I think RD had probably the opposite problem,  her flaws were highlighted more(probably a tiny bit too much) on season 2.
<p></p>Aj is an awesome character. But she misses a lot of moments and iner- conflict other characters like Rarity have.
<p></p>her flaws tend to be related to the failure of her skills rather than about her morality.
<p></p>She was't even an option as suspect at the mmystery train episode for example.
<p></p>But I love her still<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">

            and again,  the only way I can reconcile MMDW RD with the rest of her portrayal is either some sort of temporary brain damage altering her,  or just admitting the writer of that episode has no idea how to write her and hope s/he (we really need to find out which) never gets the chance to do so again. (write RD that is,  he's decent with the rest and great with pinkie)

<p></p>I think Hurrican fluttershy totally nailed her character,  as a cool but likeable character.

            I hardly hate AJ,  I adored her in Season One,  and regardless of my complaints I think she had some likeable roles here and there in Season Two. While RD did get more jerkish here and there in Season Two,  I think the extra episodes also helped humanize her a bit.
<p></p>Hurricane Fluttershy actually comes off as <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> as a result.
<p></p>It makes me wonder who might win the spotlight lottery in Season Three.

            I think MMDW was believable in the sense that I <em>do</em> think that RD could conceivably get that big of an ego,  but it's OOC in how suddenly it cropped up.  She basically goes from "oh,  it's nothing" to "I AM THE BEST AT EVERYTHING EVER" far too quickly.
<p></p>Also RD needs another "Hurricane Fluttershy" episode to show her good side more.  Season 1 balanced her better.  S2 focused a bit too much on her jerk side.

            pretty much what fallen said,  she's the one with the least internal issues,  she knows who she is and what she wants to be like,  and lives it. Her issues are when she ends up physically unable to live up to that image,  either though something that's not her fault,  or simply setting the standard to high.
