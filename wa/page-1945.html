            1. I wonder if Twilight knew Rarity was blowing her off,  but pretended to be clueless so as not to hurt her feelings.

            @Edvedd: Yeah,  I liked that as well.  I was afraid that it was going to be one of those "Rarity is thinking of moving away" types of things,  and was really glad when it turned out not to be.  I think this is a much more interesting way to handle it.  Especially the fact that it wasn't depicted as a total dichotomy,  that's one of the things that bugs me about a lot of Friend vs. Idol plots.

            I like this episode.   Not best,  well few last one are better,  but it's not my least favorite from this season.
<p></p>This episode showed more of  Canterlot,  even showed nice  upper class ponies. (I'm only pony who think  Fancy Pants is not evil?),   and few other ponies (to bad Luna wasn't) return in backgroud  like Octavia or 5th Doctor Whoof (yay),   not to mention more new  ponies ,  especially  Eleven  Doctor Whoof !!
<p></p>Also new song,   I was little disopointed that Rarity get another solo,  but it's new song so I not complain,   and song is great.
<p></p>And  PARTY CANNON !!

He is half time pony/pegasus Doctor clone (like in Journey End).
<p></p>And only in one case  fanst whanted to call pony a Master ,  but he look similar to 5th Doctor so fandom is divided.   Rest hourglass ponies have names of other Time Lords.

            I wonder if there is an equivalent for the Big Feet joke. Like,  Big horn,  Big wings,  Big... hooves,  for earth ponies? And if big horns really <em>do</em> mean that... what's up with Celestia?
<p></p>My brain is really,  really weird this morning. At any rate,  I don't think Fancy Pants has had the biggest horn so far. Blueblood's was pretty big.

Congrats. But he was still boond,  higer pitched and had similar hair to the Master. The Doctor Donna from Journey's End(assuming I'm thinking of the right episode) still looked exactly like the Doctor,  so a Doctor pegasus would still look exactly like Doc Whooves. He's just be able to walk on clouds,  or some shit.

            With all the complaints of "How can they not know the ponies who saved Equestria?",  do you think the Mane 6 could have become the best of friends without Nightmare Moon? That is one fan fiction story I would love to read.

<p></p>At this point,  you know the developers are using background ponies to mess with/honor the bronies. New Time Lord pony that HAS to have been based on Matt Smith,  the close up on Octavia playing before panning out for a full reveal. the shear NUMBER of know background pony cameos this episode.
