            I always thought if they changed the toys to match the designs of the show,  it would be good for Hasbro since the toys would fly right off the shelves from the brony audiences.

            What,  how would they remake the toys? They'd have to rebuild a set of molds. Then there's the issue of making straight up vinyl mold toys vs. brushables,  and monster toys,  and so on and so forth...
<p></p>basically,  just build new molds. There's no real reason for them not to,  save maybe for the effort it would take to build...six,  seven,  eight new molds offhand. But really,  the profits off-set it. We just need to petition,  I guess?

            Personally I like the G4 toy designs on their own,  even if they don't resemble the show's designs much. Though admittedly,  if the toys were show-accurate I would probably buy more than one of them.
<p></p>What <em>does</em> irritate me is the amount of G3/G3.5 stuff still in the current toyline. If I were to go into Target right now and look at the My Little Pony selection,  only about half of it would be the G4 designs. (Weirdly,  I think this would not irritate me nearly as much if they didn't have very different logos)

But she also appeared <em>earlier</em> with orange hair—in fact,  <em>twenty seconds earlier,  in the very same scene</em>.  So either Carrot Top has a look-alike,  or she got hit with a stray shot of the "green hair" spell too.

<p></p>Do you think Celestia actually teaches her students directly,  or do you think she's more like the principal of a high school,  and others do the actual teaching

            I imagine when it comes down to the ordinary 'school for the gifted' she's simply an overseer,  if even that. It's more likely that she simply proposed and funded the school,  so they slapped her name on it. Twilight is likely a very,  very special case.
<p></p>Actually,  along that note: Do you think Celestia being right by the testing area demonstrates some sort of omniscience,  or just that she happened to be at the right place at the right time? Canterlot seems like too big of a city for her to be seeing that spak out from just anywhere,  no matter how bright it was.

            Yeah,  I'd say Celestia is more of a headmaster for the school at large,  but takes certain specially gifted students under her personal tutelage.
<p></p>As for why Celestia was there,  I actually got the feeling that the school was either very near Canterlot Palace or that Celestia was on the grounds already for some purpose or another.

            I think it's easy to spot when the roof of one of your academy's spires suddenly has a dragon head burst through it. That,  and the glow of Twilight's magical outburst could have powered a couple lighthouses.

            I think she just sensed Twilight's magic outburst,  and probably teleported over to the school (maybe she thought it was being attacked or something,  I know I would),  then realised that it was only a powerful student.

            I wonder if maybe Celly suspected Twilight's power from the start.  During the Sun Celebration scene,  seems like she's giving Twilight a semi-interested glance.  I think Celly would have an easy enough time getting her hands on the entrance list and if she has a headmaster role,  the whole list might have to go through her anyway.  Granted,  I'm not entirely sure how she'd know to look for Twilight's name (maybe she has pony spies to check into these things for her? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">),  but she seemed to know without having to look anything up when she stopped Twi's magical freak out.  Anyway,  point is,  if she knew Twilight was trying out that day,  Celly might have been hanging out to see what might happen.
