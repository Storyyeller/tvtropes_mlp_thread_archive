            There was a clip on Tru TV's "World's Dumbest" of a guy who tried to rob a convenience store.  His disguise was a palm tree branch he held in front of his face.  I don't remember if he had a weapon,  but he kept demanding "Fifty dollar!  Fifty dollar!"
<p></p>The manager's reaction was pretty much "Are you bucking kidding me?"  He pushed the guy out of the store while cursing at him.

            @Applelight: My guess is that she did have other classes,  but wasn't <em>in</em> a "class" with any set group of ponies.  She basically had license to jump around and had a custom curriculum created for her by Celestia.  So yeah,  she probably took like "Advanced Telekinesis" or "Amniomorophic Spells 101" but wasn't on the same schedule as the other students.

            It does remind me of my first impression about the elements: That they had some mind-bending qualities so they kind of 'convinced' someone who was hit with them of the 'right' way. Which is distressing.

            I'm sure Twi had to go to actual classes.  She may have been Celestia's student,  but Celestia is still the princess,  she has more things to do than be Twilight's teacher full time.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I don't get that impression.  With Luna it was more that it restored her original outlook before she was corrupted.  Compare to Discord who was just a jerk,  they didn't alter his personality at all,  they just encased him in stone.

            On why Twilight didn't just steal the crown; I'm sure it boils down to her not wanting to stoop down to Sunset's level.

<p></p>I <em>really</em> want to see more of Twilight's time at Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns. I had hoped the introduction of Sunset Shimmer would shed more light on it but alas...
<p></p>It is totally my headcanon that Lyra Heartstrings for years had tried to befriend Twilight during school. She was "that guy",  convinced she's your BFF and constantly coming over to hang out even though the feeling isn't mutual.

            That kinda makes sense,  with that wave at the beginning of the series.
<p></p>After Canterlot Wedding I always figured that Lyra,  Moondancer and the third bridesmaid from the wedding were other fillies Cadence foalsat,  and Cadence always tried to get Twilight to make friends with them but she kinda flopped at it.

            There were some glimmers of an interesting character in Flash. He was the first person to be nice to the weird new girl in the halls,  even before Twi met the human versions of her friends. Then he dug up the evidence to exonerate Twi after Sunset Shimmer framed her. Dude was a super nice guy! If they had played up the "Twi's first human friend who isn't a counterpart of one of her pony friends" aspect of his character,  rather than making him Generic Love Interest #27,  it would have been an interesting contrast to the fact that the Humane Five weren't on speaking terms when Twi showed up.
<p></p>(And if the writers had made Flash a believable platonic friend to Twi,  the fandom would have started shipping them together anyway.)
<p></p>Now I'm imagining a version of <em>EQG</em> where Twi nearly writes off Canterlot High as an irredeemable hellhole after discovering the Humane Five aren't friends,  then Flash Sentry is the one who convinces her that these weird hairless bipeds are actually worth saving.

            Head canoning this all.  Thank you guys.
<p></p>And erm,  you may hate me for this but,  I want Fancy Free to go/have been to the school and I want his past interactions with Twilight to have been less than nice.  See,  if Twilight was the studious bookworm,  he's the loud obnoxious frat boy.  Always in trouble,  and likely to be an unintentional bully too.

            @Kegisak: I like that theory.  Pity I can't work it into my story somehow.
<p></p>@Meta: If they would have played him as a platonic friend he might have been worth salvaging. Unfortunately,  he seems to have only been included for <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> and nothing else. If they would have set up the whole "<a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumpIntoHello" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumpIntoHello">Bump Into Hello</a> with a cute guy" thing and then subverted it by having them be uninterested romantically it would have been great.  As is,  it feels like a cliched "high school girls are always interested in boys" thing.
