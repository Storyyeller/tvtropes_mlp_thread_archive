            @Osias: The problem the episode had is that if you ignore the historical atrocities committed against real life native groups and go solely by the events that are actually shown in the episode,  the Appleoosans really weren't that bad.  All they did was settle a patch of land that,  as far as they knew,  was uninhabited,  and they were apparently there for quite some time before the buffalo showed up and demanded (without explanation) that they uproot everything and leave.  It wasn't like real life where settlers were actively displacing the natives or driving them out; they honestly didn't know that anyone claimed ownership of the land.  The other thing is that the buffalo never explained why; they just said "get the hell out" without giving any reasons why the ponies should leave.  If they would have said "Guys,  you put your crap in the middle of our land" and the ponies were like "GTFO" then yeah,  there'd be a problem on both sides,  but as is,  they never give the ponies a reason why they should leave.
<p></p>Don't get me wrong,  the real life stuff that happened with the settlers and Native Americans was utterly despicable,  but <em>none of that stuff actually happened in the episode</em>.  In the context of the show itself,  the ponies are only guilty of accidentally settling land that they <em>didn't know</em> was pre-owned,  and then being reluctant to move when they aren't given a real reason to leave.  Braeburn outright <em>says</em> at one point that he has no idea why the buffalo want them gone; the conflict of the episode is more <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a> than anything else.

<p></p>Not that it didn't have it's good points,  but on the whole I consider it one of the weaker ones.

            Let me confess something: to me,  that episode was not about American history while I was watching. I didn't see it as a commentary about native Americans or land. I saw a problem specific from Equestria barely inspired by western movies. Only after,  reading the reviews,  I realized the deeper <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>.
<p></p>Maybe because I'm slow,  not because I'm not American.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">My main gripes are 1. it didn't do a good job of making the conflict seem even on both sides 2. the mane cast was kinda incidental to the conflict being solved 3. the resolution came out of nowhere,  and the chief just completely lucked into it.</div>
While I was seeing it as a "western episode",  none of this mattered,  and it was my favorite episode until then.

            JT is absolutely right. The Appleloosians <em>didn't do anything wrong! At all</em>! As far as they were concerned,  <em>they</em> were being evicted and forced to starve! Even the buffulloes explanation of why they needed the land was stupid. "It is our <em>traditional</em> stampeding ground!"
<p></p>"So... you need to run there. Not for any life preserving purpose. And you can't stampede anywhere else because...?"
<p></p>"<em>Tradition!</em>"
<p></p>Don't get me wrong,  I like tradition,  <em>as long as it isn't causing harm or hindering progress</em>.

            No one thinks the Appleossans did anything wrong. The thing is,  the buffalo didn't do anything wrong,  either. Land that they essentially owned had been settled by outsiders while they were away,  and they wanted it back. Nothing wrong with that. What <em>was</em> wrong was the neither side would compromise,  which was the whole point of the episode.

<p></p>But if the Apploosians had done what the buffulo wanted,  they would have died horribly, whereas if the buffulo had done what the Apploosians wanted,  they would have had a slightly longer run.

As I recall,  that was exactly what they did at the end.
<p></p>The buffalo get to do their traditional stampede,  the ponies harness some of the stampede energy to knock some of the apples down,  and everyone gets warm pie for dessert. Everyone wins!
