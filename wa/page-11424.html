            I like to think that Celestia has a "stare" of her own; not necessarily a natural ability,  but a counterspell that requires eye contact. And that she's had to use it on Twilight a few times,  one example being her first outburst and another being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the episode Steventheman's about to watch</span>.

            Say,  which of the mane cast would make the best cook?
<p></p>I would say Pinkie Pie,  but on the second thought,  I don't think she can make any food that isn't sweet.
<p></p>I guess my best bet is Twilight,  because I can count on her to correctly follow the recipe.
<p></p>Then again,  Applejack also has a lot of experience with cooking,  but all we seen her making are apple-related goods.
<p></p>Maybe Fluttershy?
<p></p>I don't think I've ever seen Rarity cooking.
<p></p>Rainbow Dash. Nah.

            Applejack,  definitely. It's not like not using apples instantly decreases her skills at it. Cooking is cooking.
<p></p>Rarity <em>did</em> cook breakfast in Sisterhooves Social,  though,  so you <em>have</em> seen her cook. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            @ Steven,  oh yeah so did a lot of peoples.
<p></p>AJ is best all around cook. Pinkie is the best at making sweets,  well she could be,  but she experiments way to much making it sporadic on what's good and what's not.
<p></p>Rarity and Fluttershy probably are decent.
<p></p>Twilight,  I could go either way,  she seems like if she actaully tried,  and had the cookbook and everything all set and was set in the goal of cooking and nothing else,  she'd be okay,  but she'd also be the type that would just not care most of the time and be to busy to notice how bad her food was,  or let stuff burn etc..
<p></p>RD,  lives entirely off take out and ready to eat pre-packed food. She once set her home on fire trying to boil water. yes her CLOUD home.

<p></p>Re cooking: AJ is probably the best cook in terms of making food that other ponies would like.  I'd say that Pinkie is probably a good baker,  the problem is that she has trouble differentiating between "I like this" and "what other ponies would like".  Pinkie would probably bake something that she'd personally really like,  but other ponies would find nasty.  When it comes to baking she's probably good as long as she sticks to the recipe and doesn't try to get inventing.
<p></p>Rarity and Fluttershy are probably pretty good,  Twilight is probably alright too,  as long as she's willing to put the effort in rather than living off of hot pockets.
<p></p>RD...she's either one of those people who'd live off of protein shakes and stereotypical athlete food,  or just doesn't give a crap and eats ramen and whatever she can mooch off her friends.
