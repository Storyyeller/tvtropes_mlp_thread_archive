            Okay I lied Gargoyles really wasnt the first... I guess it was the first I watched in earnest.
<p></p>I had watched stuff like Thundercats and Dinosaucers and stuff like that in the 80's,  but not regularly.. it just happened to be on and I watched it.

            I hate disney. The people who made ATLA also made American Dragon Jake Long. They TRIED to weave in an ongoing narrative and make it darker as it went on,  but Disney kept getting under their feet.
<p></p>A shame,  since I loved Am Drag

            I liked the first season. the art style of the second one just kinda... turned me off. Too much of a stark shift too fast,  plus Jake's dragon form just looked <em>weird</em> after that.

            Admitedly,  cartoons have a more restricted dynamic in the west. People generally refer to cartoons as cute boing and zap <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">Funny Animal</a> nonsense here so maybe mature animations just don't get enough appeal to keep going.
<p></p>That and a lot of dark concepts tend to have a very pretentious undertone. Some forget that the morbid and gloomy cosmetics don't instantly make a show artsy and depthful. Good writing does,  hense saccharine kids cartoons like FIM which have surprisingly complex characterizations and avoid a lot of detrimental development tropes that darker ones do.

            Okay,  sorry about the rushedness of my last post,  I was eating while typing.
<p></p>I wasn't criticizing Gargoyles and Batman for their premises.  I was criticizing the <em>handling</em> of their premises.  I mean yeah,  you could say "<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonBall" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonBall">a bunch of guys using Ki to fly around and throw beams at each other</a>" is silly too,  but that show <em>knows</em> its silly,  and will play different levels of seriousness as appropriate.  Goku never once treated Emperor Pilaf as if he was a serious villain.  By contrast,  early on the Gargoyles are menaced by <em>television actors</em>,  and they _*are*_ presented not just as a serious threat (to demons who grew up in a time of bloody warfare and thus,  should by rights be whole tiers above these people,  mind you) but also as a part of Xanatos bigger overall plan... which is <em>supposed</em> to make Xanatos look like a genius.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">@Moe Premise means nothing when it comes to quality. I would think that the very thread we are having this discussion in would stand as a testament to that. </div>
<p></p>The thing is,  MLP works out precisely <em>because</em> it puts on no airs about itself.  It knows its a silly and lighthearted show,  and in fact... that's its biggest charm.

            But even that much isn't really giving it any kind of credit. It looks at a basic outline but not at the work itself. It's still potentially possible for it to have very god,  solid writing and be a good series in spite of that skeleton draft.

            Gargoyles werent really Deamons... and yes they grew up in time of Bloody warfare but they were protectors and guardians,  not DPS warriors.  Plus you got guys in a Dark ages mindset dropped into the modern world.. where even basic stuff to us is Magic to them...
<p></p>The younger ones adapted quicky but Hudson and Goliath had a bit of a rough time trying to figure stuff out.

            Ah... hold on,  I just want to make sure I've got the chronology of the series right.

            @kegi yes that's right. Eh,  I guess I liked his season 2 dragon form better because it felt more fitting for his age. How he looked in season 1 was how he should've EVENTUALLY ended up. For the moment he's still growing.
<p></p>... it made sense to me anyway

            Well in season 1,  the art style blended more with other Disney Channel cartoons airing at the time.

            Eh,  that's fair enough Ginger. I just didn't really like the <em>design</em> of the season 2 dragon,  especially not after getting used to season 1. But eh.
