            <div class="quoteblock">Celestia and Luna are old souls,  immensely powerful ponies whose souls bonded to the flow of magic after their death,  and were eventually reborn and bonded to an element (in this case,  the sun and the moon). They're still ridiculously powerful and nigh-immortal by pony standards,  but no match for a true god like Discord without some help.</div>
<p></p>So they they were created the same way as The God-Emperor of Mankind?! I'm kind of ok with this theory.

            "Earth" might just be Puddinghead's pet name for their world (because it's covered in earth). The earth ponies were originally going to name Equestria "Earth" weren't they?

<p></p>They've had thousands of years of practice,  Ginger. It's bloody cold when they're around so ponies would be irritable anyways,  and they could just sneak around a sow a few seeds of discord among them. They knew that Discord himself was up to something,  but they still got tricked.
<p></p>Or maybe Windigo himself doesn't need the disharmony,  or has enough to sustain himself. The windigos are just heralds and need a constant supply of it to survive away from their master. There are ways that the plot could work,  one way or another.

<p></p>What happened to the 3 kingdoms after their leaders left? Puddinghead,  Plattinum,  and Hurricane all left during one of the most turbulent times in their country's history.
<p></p>The way I see it there are 2 possibilities:

            Maybe everypony moved to Equestria with them,  they just didn't have room for 10, 000 plus ponies onstage. Actually I just pulled that number out of thiin air but it begs the question: What IS the population of Equestria?

            They would have had to bring at least <em>some</em> of their tribes with them when they went to Equestria. But I like to think other factions formed and splintered off. some of them might have joined together,  but other factions might have formed countries dedicated to a single race,  and learned to get food on their own.

            I'm guessing that in reality,  they lead their nations away or something.  They only showed the leaders in the show because it would be a pain in the butt to have zillions of background ponies following them everywhere.  Or rather,  the leaders were as shown,  but their second-in-commands represent all the other ponies.  Like in the historical event,  the leaders were mean to each other,  but while the leaders fought the subjects realized that they actually got along pretty well.

Overexaggeration. MWW writes Dashie as a loud-mouthed,  obnoxious jerk,  and that isn't great.
<p></p>Her lowest point throughout the series,  where she postpones saving a pony falling to her death in order to give autographs (and she failed to save her!),  is in TMMDW written by Williams. I don't like it. I didn't like the entire Ponyville acting OOC,  too.
<p></p>Williams is fresh from writing shows such as Spongebob Squarepants. She has a penchant for batshit weird comedy. Her portayal of Dashie is again a bit overexagerrated,  but that's for show. But her Pinkie,  <strong>who is a Loony Tunes character</strong> trapped in a non-LT kind of universe,  is excellently spot on. Again,  the entire map scene is pure comedy gold in the vein of Animaniacs or LT. Wordplay? Check. Rapid fire comedy? Check. Fourth wall abuse? Check. Etc.
<p></p>Also,  the episode showcased a lot of something many people find enjoyable in MLPFIM: humour based on characters and interaction between them.

No shit,  Rarity barely did anything wacky and the other three of the mane cast were underplayed.
