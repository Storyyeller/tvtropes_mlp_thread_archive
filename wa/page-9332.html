            I <em>like</em> crack pairings,  but things that I actually ship are things where i think that they'd <em>actually</em> be happy together. Because I <em>want</em> people to be happy.

            I like realism (in the sense of being consistent with the show's characterization),  and I like shipping.  <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackPairings" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackPairings">Crack Pairings</a> run on <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>; they're amusing,  but if you want to use it as a vehicle to explore the characters more,  they tend to break down a bit.

            One of the best things I remember doing was an April fool's joke on a discontinued online Game called Project Rockstar. Basically you create bands and manage them. The game sometimes hits you with random events - some good and some bad.
<p></p>I created a 'new' account almost a week before and got it going. On April first I deleted all my bands and went into the forum screaming about this event concerning how all of my bands were so sick of me that they quit and also managed to sue me for contract costs and I posted the text of the 'event' as proof.
<p></p>It looked like nobody was going to fall for it. I come back an hour later. <em>TOTAL. CHAOS.</em> The board was rampant with pitchforks and torches.
<p></p>Apparently I'd worded the event text so perfectly along with the fact that my account had a good amount of money but no bands that the other players were completely taken in. Many of them threatened to close their accounts if this event wasn't removed from the game.
<p></p>Up to the point where the site was shut down roughly a year later there were <em>still</em> people who believed that was a real event.

<p></p>I wouldn't say Discord's a "tyrant."  Tyrants are about iron-fisted rule,  Discord is more about eff all.

            <div class="quoteblock">One of the best things I remember doing was an April fool's joke on a discontinued online Game called Project Rockstar. Basically you create bands and manage them. The game sometimes hits you with random events - some good and some bad.
<p></p>I created a 'new' account almost a week before and got it going. On April first I deleted all my bands and went into the forum screaming about this event concerning how all of my bands were so sick of me that they quit and also managed to sue me for contract costs and I posted the text of the 'event' as proof.
<p></p>It looked like nobody was going to fall for it. I come back an hour later. TOTAL. CHAOS. The board was rampant with pitchforks and torches.
<p></p>Apparently I'd worded the event text so perfectly along with the fact that my account had a good amount of money but no bands that the other players were completely taken in. Many of them threatened to close their accounts if this event wasn't removed from the game.
<p></p>Up to the point where the site was shut down roughly a year later there were still people who believed that was a real event. </div>
<p></p>Wow,  what a great prank.

<p></p>@Moe: Well,  we've never seen eye to eye on Discord.
<p></p>EDIT: He still sets himself up as the ruler and oppresses the nation though. It's enough for me.

            stevebat:  I don't think Discord would actually rule at all,  I imagine he'd just bask in the misery he causes the ponies he meddles with after he ousts Celestia.
