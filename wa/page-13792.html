            There <em>will</em> be people that lose interest because it's not about ponies anymore (because they were only into it because of that,  in the first place),  but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

            I've seen some comments with that sentiment. Fair,  but that was never the absolute biggest thing for me. It looked like a solid game.

            It's official. Lauren wins at life.
<p></p>On a less awesome note,  Questria is un-ponying itself so they don't get Hasbrowned.  So...now it's basically just Realms of Everquest.

            But isn't one of the reasons Fighting is Magic got C&D'd because it was getting too much attention?  I've barely heard anything about Questria.  Just keep these games a bit on the down low until you finish them and things should be fine.

            Well it would also be an online coop game,  so getting a C&D anytime after release would be disastrous too.
<p></p>That's a rather glaring flaw with most of the pony games in development,  really.  Almost all of them are primarily or exclusively multiplayer and need a server to not get C&amp;D'd.

            I think I would have appreciated that announcement from Lauren & Mane 6 more if I hadn't read the Derpibooru comments on it. There was this guy hammering on the idea that <em>Friendship Is Magic</em> was pretty much the only good idea Lauren Faust has ever had. But then again,  he was talking about Fourchan as though he were familiar with the place and his username quite intentionally had the letters "nigg" in it,  so to hell with him.

            Well it's nice to see that Lauren Faust is actually going to follow through on her offer. Since it's going to be all new characters I do wonder what they will come up (assuming they don't decided to just do Milky Way and the Galaxy Girls).
<p></p>Also we finally get to see the official Equestria Girls designs and. . .blegh. Yeah. . . Happy 30th Anniversary MLP.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/Thumbs_down_emoticon_3571.png" alt="[tdown]" title="[thumb down]" height="16" width="16">

I don't know what it means on That Message Board,  but the Usenet version of it was flipped the other way around,  the "Eternal September".
<p></p>Basically,  September was infamous for being the time when college kids got back to school,  got more access to their school's computers,  and would fuck around on Usenet posting braindead crap and ignoring etiquette. And then America Online made Usenet access a feature,  and the Usenet bulletin boards were inundated with noobs and teenage assholes all year round. (Like I said,  I'm not a hundred percent certain when the Eternal <em>Summer</em> started,  but I suspect it has to do with That Website's founder instituting anonymous posting on all boards.)
<p></p>But yeah,  this douchebag basically said that Lauren's projects are all the same — one or two moments of sheer genius,  a dozen pretty good ideas,  and about four or five <em>horrible fucking ideas</em> that will poison the whole damn thing if somebody doesn't for God's sake talk her out of them. Horrible ideas like thinking that you can do a magical-girl series (like <em>Milky Way and the Galaxy Girls</em>) as a <em>straightforward</em> action-comedy,  with <em>no</em> parodic elements,  and somehow keep the show from being sneered at as an anemic ripoff of <em>Sailor Moon</em> or <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em> and canceled in the first season. Horrible ideas like the characters she personally helped develop for <em>Foster's Home</em>,  who repeatedly came off as <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a>...
