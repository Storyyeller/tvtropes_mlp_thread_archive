            ^It could be that Discord ruled a larger area than what's presently Equestria,  keeping ponykind under his heels,  until Celestia and Luna rose up against him and 'created' Equestria.
<p></p>Oh,  crap!  <em>That explains why ponykind has an instinctive fear of natural</em> (see: chaotic) <em>growth</em>.  As a people,  they remember the days when Discord ruled them.  If Discord broke the natural order badly enough,  that might also explain why Celestia and Luna had to take over the sun and the moon at all.

            I wonder who even invented the elements of harmony. This whole scenario smacks of there being something bigger going on behind the scenes. Luna and Celestia "discovered" the elements and used them to beat Discord,  they didn't forge them. That makes me think that there's a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerBad" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerBad">Bigger Bad</a> than Discord (an actual representation of pure chaos maybe) somewhere out there,  and a Bigger Good than the Princesses who initially created the elements.
<p></p>What even disconnected them from the elements? was it Luna? but Celestia used them to seal her away,  so she was still connected to them at that point at least

            ^The disconnect happened when Twilight and her friends claimed the Elements for themselves.  Presumably Celestia was still linked to them at that point,  but (as that comic I linked a few posts ago suggested) she might also have lost her connection to the Elements when she banished Luna,  the one pony she was truly friends with - which makes sense.  Every other pony in Equestria has to view her as the Princess first,  then as Celestia,  while for Luna,  that wouldn't be a problem.

I'm inclined to think it happened after Luna was sealed away though,  because I can't imagine Celestia willingly giving up ownership of the elements if there was any chance it was going to provide Discord with a way to escape,  or otherwise weaken her to the point where spells she'd casted previously would begin to crumble. (unless maybe she thought she'd still have partial ownership of them?)
<p></p>Although I do like the idea that Celestia dosn't know EVERYTHING about the elements. Makes her more human.... er... mortal

The main focus of part two should be the reformation of the mane cast,  and the eventual defeat of Discord. Luna's angst is something that deserves a lot of time to be fleshed out.
<p></p>I wouldn't mind a short exchange between the two of them though,  which maybe hints that Discord knows about Luna's time as Nightmare Moon (pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not so Different</a> on her so to speak) even if he wasn't the one who actually did it

            I could have sworn I mentioned that "The entire world was like the Everfree Forest before the ponies took over" thing pages ago.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>Then again,  I theorized that the world sort of did it's own thing without the ponies was the case even before Discord's nature was revealed. So I guess this sort of semi-confirms that theory.  I still like the idea that the world would take it's own course if no one interfered with it.  It makes more sense than the idea that the world can't function without the ponies.

            She <em>and</em> Luna fought Discord,  recall.
<p></p>So,  I wonder. At the time,  there were five Elements,  yes? (Unless the sixth had appeared to them,  and then disappeared at some point,  only to be revealed again by Twilight 1000 years later) I wonder who had which in the battle against Discord?

            ^The fact that Celestia might have discovered the sixth when she banished Nightmare Moon makes the issue a little tricky,  but I imagine (given Discord's power) that not even the Princesses could have stoned him with only five Elements.

There either had to be other casters,  maybe from the other species,  or maybe the original elements were of two parts,  before further being broken down into six,  sometime after the nightmare event.
<p></p>And the Celestia who sealed away Nightmare Moon had the crown of Magic,  so I'm gonna assume it is discovered every time the Elements get a new set of owners.
