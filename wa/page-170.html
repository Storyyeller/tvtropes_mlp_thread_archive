This show isn't about that and it doesn't have to be. sure Rarity had some girlish dreams about her prince,  but that was more along the lines of character development than "rarity is straight".

            I agree.  A,  there's very little actual romance in the show.  2,  everyone makes all the ponies lesbians already.  And III,  I know that it's a good thing to teach about acceptance,  but the TARGET AUDIENCE for the show strikes me as a wee bit young to develop any sort of attraction one way or another,  and the "LGBT acceptance" moral would be better served towards a slightly older demographic.  We could always reference it for the purposes of the moral (girls like cakes and boys like pies,  but there's a boy that prefers cake!),  but to have an openly gay character in a show where there's not a lot of romantic love would just feel like shoehorning it in.

            I think I have a few ideas:
<p></p>1. I'm asexual,  and I like the idea of the characters being asexual,  when the only big asexual characters on television are <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBangTheory" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBangTheory">Sheldon</a> and... yeah,  pretty much just Sheldon.
<p></p>2. I get the funny feeling that those threads are less about setting positive LGBT role models for kids and more about validating ships. And I really hate shipping. Like,  one person in the thread posted an idea for an episode that would basically be Twilight/Trixie (I have no idea why people like her - she's an annoying,  egotistical brat devoid of any redeeming or endearing qualities),  and I'm not going to say what I was thinking because that would be rude.
<p></p>I mean,  I watch <em>Glee</em> all the time,  and my favorite character (barring an utterly appalling statement concerning bisexuality) is <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Kurt, </a> so it can't be that I'm a homophobe.

            To be fair,  I don't think it's the egotistical,  condescending braggart Trixie that the fans are in love with. More like a confident,  self-reliant Trixie (usually softening her negative side by crafting a scene that makes Trixie have a generous share of humble pie).

            "(girls like cakes and boys like pies,  but there's a boy that prefers cake!),  but to have an openly gay character in a show where there's not a lot of romantic love would just feel like shoehorning it in. " Well-said.
<p></p>I also want to add that those kinds of morals are even better served without bringing gender into it at all.  We get very specific about what we can accept and what we can't. One moral I am hoping for is a simple "celebration of differences" moral—something they have hinted at with "dog and Pny Show" and "Swarm of the century". I'm imagining a moral along the lines of "just because somepony thinks differently than you,  doesn't mean that they are wrong or that you are right. As friends,  we need to celebrate each other's differences."

<p></p>You mean "You gotta share,  you gotta care"?
<p></p>Yeah,  I think acceptance of difference is such an inherent premise of this whole series that it really doesn't need an episode to itself.

            Been thinking about the physics behind the Sonic Rainboom. Light does travel faster than sound but I don't think that's what's happening here. A sonic boom does created a shockwave in the air. Rainbows are caused by reflections of light through raindrops. So what if the shockwave coused by Rainbow Dash's flying alters the way the water in the air sits in just such a way that the light bounces off of it looking like a rainbow?

            It's actually spelled "Soarin'". And I think male shippers outnumber the female shippers by a <em>wide</em> margin. That's not to say they're better as they can still get into heated flamewars. Those flamewars just tend to be manlier.

            mm,  I'm not sure they're any more an ensemble darkhorse than any of the other background characters. I mean,  except for the fact that they actually have speaking parts,  but I always though that an ensemble darkhorse was supposed to be a recurring minor character - they've only really had parts in one or two episodes thus far - unless you count all of Dash's imagine spots.
