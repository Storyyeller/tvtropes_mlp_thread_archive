            @Lurker: It's not that we're on the Internet,  and of course I'm not saying that it shouldn't be marked and that people shouldn't be allowed to have their objections to it.  I was mainly replying to Freeman's 'it's perverted but still cute' post with the point that one doesn't necessarily preclude the other. =D  Cuteness and 'purity' have a lot of strongly intertwined connections in people's minds,  and sex is widely viewed as 'impure',  so that was largely the point I was trying to argue against.
<p></p>Re: horns: I actually like the idea of enamel (or,  hell,  why not alicorn?) more than keratin,  since nails are actually kind of gross and it would have to be layered rather thickly to have any sort of durability to it.
<p></p>^Much,  much less of male/male,  Ginger.

            ok that rambled a bit,  let me clarify. At what point does it become something that needs a warning? ginger has a very legitimate reason to not think it needed one,  all others that did had had a specific tag on them from the site,  this one did not have the tag,  so how is he to magically know that someone would have issues with it if the usual marker for something with the quality is missing.

            Both Seraph and Syd have good points.  In this particular case,  I'd lean toward saying that having a warning might have been a good idea not because it's visually explicit,  but because the subject matter is mature.

            Which again is an individual variable that has no measurable answer. Since it would depend upon the individual 13 years old in question,  what exactly might be the issue,  how badly the puritanical obsession with anything at all sex related is the most evil of evils has seeped into you from society at large,  etc etc.
