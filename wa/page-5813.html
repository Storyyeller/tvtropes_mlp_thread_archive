<p></p>Seems like a tautology to me. If it's purely prurient,  that means they didn't focus on plot.

            @Story: That's exactly what I'm saying; if you prioritize sex over all other elements of the story,  it isn't going to be good.  Basically,  a story written solely to arouse the reader with no other purpose in mind.  As opposed to a story that does have characterization and plot,  but also happens to include sex.

            @Ilse:  I found it really hard to sympathize with Luna's speech there,  because it was almost entirely based on her treatment of Blueblood,  which I think was completely justified.  I mean,  the guy tried to ruin Octavia's career out of spite by canceling her concert even though it was highly successful and then locking her bandmate in a bathroom.  The fact that he's on the verge of becoming better doesn't really excuse his past actions and Vinyl was totally right to give him crap about it.
<p></p>She did go too far with Celestia though,  I'll give Luna that.

            @Ginger: Like I said,  it depends on how you define a "clop fic".  If you define it as a story that just happens to include sex rather than being based around it,  I think they can be good.

            @Ginger:  A story can strive for both,  but most don't bother.  And honestly,  I don't think that's a problem.  Sometimes someone just wants some porn.  It can be good at what it is without being a good story.  And sometimes there are those that actually are objectively good.  They're just heavily in the minority.

            Yeah,  I think their relationships are really complicated right now. I'm enjoying the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> both Trixie and Blueblood are getting though. And yeah,  I think Luna was only partially justified. She didn't get the complete story,  but if some random girl you didn't know just burst in and started insulting my nephew,  especially if he was clearly depressed,  I would be pretty mad,  even if I didn't know the full story

            @Ginger: I agree,  I just don't think that unless you're just making straight-up porn,  arousing the reader shouldn't take precedence over other elements of the fic.  They aren't mutually exclusive by any means,  but I honestly can't call a story good unless it has some form of characterization or plot or whatever,  and most clopfics tend to throw those out the window.
