            @Apple: Actually it's more that the french were in a really bad way when they first attacked during WWII. their economy was in shambles from the last war,  and Germany took advantage of that to make a fell attack. the french government knew it would destroy their country to resist,  so they surrendered with the knowledge that their allies would back them up.
<p></p>The french <em>people</em>,  on the other hand,  did not surrender. The french resistance terrorized the axis from within for pretty much the entire war.

            Last Roundup really deserves more credit than it gets as "the derpy episode". There's a reason it's my third favorite episode. Pretty much everything about it was good. It showed just how good AJ is at physical activity; she won more ribbons than anyone according to Cherry Jubilee. Cherry Jubilee herself was interesting,  as was Dodge,  even if it was mostly named as such for that one joke. Pinkie was hilarious<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> Sorry,  ginger.</div></span> and the chase scene was entertaining. The Derpy scene was just a nice treat. <br> <br>Also,  Blissey,  I'm guessing you found the original version of the episode that actually had her name called. There was a lot of drama about that,  but let's just leave it at that. <br> <br><div class="quoteblock">I still enjoyed it,  I just wish AJ had a better reason than not winning first.</div>
She went to the competition to get money to fix the town hall. She didn't get the money and had to find another method.

            Ah,  but Ginger,  here's the difference: Nobody around me speaks vietnamese.
<p></p>Maybe it's a different perspective: I'm Canadian,  I was raised around french. Even if I don't speak it,  I recognize it instantly. So to me,  I <em>would</em> be able to identify it if someone barged in yelling it. Just like someone from the southern united states would instantly recognize spanish,  and someone from china would be able to tell the difference between madrin and cantonese.
<p></p>But Fancy does seem to be a common language around there. Gustav was clearly a native speaker and he lived close by. Fleur appeared to be an ambassador or language teacher perhaps,  meaning that it's common enough around to warrant either. It's reasonable that AJ would have been able to recognize it instantly.

            Some ponies make better friends than other,  Pip. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try; you should always give someone a chance,  otherwise someone who <em>would</em> be a good friend would be passed over.

            @kegi Well,  I'm from wales,  I wouldn't consider myself poorly educated,  there are LOADS of foreigners around of asian descent who speak in languages from Asia,  and I don't recognize any of them for the language it is. (ESPECIALLY if the identification of the language is the absolute last thing on my mind,  which it would've been for AJ in that scene)

            On the other hand Griffons are very rare,  we've only seen two and we know that none have been to Ponyville prior to Gilda. While Fleur may be a language teacher of the Griffon language that does not necessitate that it is nearby.
