            This episode sort of highlights to me a major difference in Kindness,  as compared to <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GEnerosity" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GEnerosity">G Enerosity</a> or Laughter. It represents a willingness to see the good in someone,  and the confidence that people will respond favorably to good deeds done to them.

<p></p>But yeah,  it's basically what Perpetual said; a lot of things that FE "predicted" are common fantasy elements that aren't really specific to the show. If it had predicted say,  the name of the Zebra home nation,  I'd be impressed.  The other thing is that FE is so damn long and expansive that it was bound to get <em>something</em> right.  Heck,  a while back I wrote a chapter in my story that pretty much revolved around the concept of "it's not important what you do,  it's important who you do it with".  Then a week later AFR came out.  I couldn't honestly say I predicted it,  just that I happened to utilize a common idea before the show got around to it.
<p></p>Enlong: That's a good way of putting it.  They way I see it,  an important part of kindness is the ability to continue to be nice,  even in circumstances where it might be detrimental to you because it's beneficial in the long run.  Fluttershy knew that initially Discord would give her a hard time,  but in the end that's what ultimately sold him on the concept: she was willing to stick with him even though he was making things harder for him. It proved that she was actually putting her money where her mouth was and not just pretending to be nice for the sake of some perceived benefit.  If she had cracked and let them use the elements on him,  he wouldn't have reformed because he'd think "See,  she was willing to screw me over".
<p></p>Granted,  I still wish they had address the idea of Discord taking advantage of her a bit more; there's definitely a point where you have to stop giving them the benefit of the doubt and put your foot down.  I really want to see them tackle that and have an episode about how being nice doesn't mean you have to bend over backwards for everyone else.
<p></p>@Psi: Holy crap that makes a lot of sense.  That needs to on <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a>.

            @ Story,  a really wierd case,  but then again what ISN'T wierd when it involves Pinkie. Of Li'lpip watching a mmory orb of hers,  and talking to her while in her head. Though,  it was,  odd. Pinkie knew she was in there,  but it was her subconscious that was actually talking to Li'lpip,  and even though Li'lpip tied to warn her about The End,  she couldn't do anything,  and Real Pinkie didn't know the details,  but did,  Mostly via Pinkie Sense,  end up setting up a few things Li'lpip would need later on.
<p></p>Like I said it was wierd,  not only was it Pinkie,  but it was Pinkie while she was high as a kite on drugs that boosed her brain exponentially,  including her Pinkie Sense. not only did Li'lpip end up giving her the nudge to set something up,  the Mirror Pinkie made a few sryptic remarks that ended up being about Li'lpip's future.
