            @Pannic I liked it.  It was a bit shorter than I expected but the two of them really do have good harmony and interaction.  Interesting choice in costume considering the opera.  Bravo sir and bring more culture to the bacteria!

            @Blissey Don't worry,  you get two episodes without any Pinkie Pie followed by one that doesn't involve her much at all,  then one last one focusing on her before the finale. No one really gets over exposed that much. It just seems that way because of the way the episodes get lined up.

<p></p>That's because scrolls are a sort of one time use pre cast spell,  so you don't need the actual ability or time to cast the spell.

            Well,  once again,  I cannot fall asleep. So I'm just gonna go and say this: I'm starting to think that "Cutie mark chronicles" has taken a certain episode's place as my personal worst episode. I mean,  the backstories for the mane 6 were pretty neat {Especially Twilight's},  but the writing and maybe even the animation took a massive drop in quality. I dunno,  it was just very cheesy,  weak and boring apart from a couple things. *Shrugs*
<p></p>This is just my opinon though,  anyone can feel free to disagree. I'm aware that this post might start a flame war,  but it can't be anywhere near as bad as the last time I talked trash about a popular episode.

            The animation got worse? I don't think <em>any</em> episode has ever had significantly worse animation than another,  not counting the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump">Animation Bump</a> between seasons one and two.

Not worse per say,  it just seemed kinda choppy at certain parts {Which,  go figure,  I don't remember now}. Then again,  I did rewatch it on a synchtube stream,  but the stream itself wasn't getting glitchy. I mean for all I know,  my memory might be horrible,  and/or not being able to sleep might be making me say stupid things. But I still stand by the episode itself being rather weak.
<p></p>Just forget about what I said about the animation for now,  allright? Please? I really don't want this to end up like the last time I admitted to hating a popular episode.

            I know what he's talking about. I noticed it during the rewatch,  too. It's not that the animation got worse,  it's just that it seems less lively,  more rigid. Not really what you're used to in the show. For an example,  near the start right after the title,  Apple Bloom looks like she sort of slides forward. It's not really enough to hurt the episode much,  though. <br>Mars,  you really need to stop taking episode opinion/debate so seriously. :v

<p></p>speaking of errors,  I saw another in Its About Time. At 18:54,  spike stops licking the ice cream,  but the ice cream is still moving as though he's licking it. It's a really small thing,  but for some reason it immediately leaped out at me the first time I saw it.
