            Yeah,  Mousa is on vacation with family or something.  I wouldn't expect him to be around lately.
<p></p>I will say the school thing is at least partially my own fault; I could have started one of the papers two weeks ago,  but I didn't realize that the teacher had posted the guidelines,  so I didn't get it out of the way as fast as I could have.  But still,  this is probably the most dense clump of work since my junior year of college.  At that point I had one semester that required over 100 total pages worth of material.  Only reason I survived is because about 40 pages worth of that was for a creative writing class.

            That's a shame,  Apple. I grew up in a small town,  so I know the feeling. It's been two years since I lived there and you could still pop me down on the opposite end of town from my parent's house and I could find my way home,  blindfolded. You just have to find yourself a favourite route,  I suppose.

            Hah,  procrastination wasn ever an option in my school. Not if I wanted to sleep. I started my projects on the first day of the quarter,  and finsihed on the final day.
<p></p>I saw the people who procrastinated,  staying in the labs at school until the trains stopped running,  desperately <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IVing" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IVing">I Ving</a> coffee into their arms. I even knew some people who passed out in the cafeteria until the security guards came and woke them up. I did not envy them. Couldn't QUITE bring myself to laugh at them,  but didn't envy them.

<p></p>What was your home town like?
<p></p>Belfast is...odd.  It's a city by British standards (i.e,  it has a Cathedral...two actually).  It has a population of about a quarter of a million...and occupies 44 square miles of space.  But it just seems really...small.
<p></p>Anyway,  yeah I have a favorite route.  The lagan valley parks...lovely place.

            The sad thing is that I'm not even the worst procrastinator I know.  I had a friend in high school would would literally finish papers up in the study hall the period before it was due.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            It was... well,  small. It only barely qualified as a town,  actually,  at just over 5, 000 people. Which had it's upsides and downsides. Being a half-hour away from the nearest city by car meant that it was sort of an ideal destination for more upper-middle-class folks who wanted to get away from the city,  but it also began as a mining town,  for Limestone. So we have this sort of division between the old town,  where I lived,  and the new developments. So basically half the town was pretty rich,  and other half was,  while not slumming it,  old and very worn-in. We had I think four churches,  though most of them were comparatively modern buildings,  and the buildings got progressively older the closer you strayed to the quarry.
<p></p>It was a nice place,  honestly. Very peaceful and quiet,  even if the kids did suffer from small town syndrom as much as anywhere else in the world. Very country,  as well. My favourite restaurant was named after the fellow who owned it and was decorated with his various hunting trophies.
