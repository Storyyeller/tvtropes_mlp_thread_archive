Just because most unicorns are limited in the spells they can perform doesn't mean that they don't have to learn those spells. Rarity's illusion spell probably isn't something that she naturally knows how to do,  so she must have learned it from somewhere,  namely a book. </div>
<p></p>And how could the book possibly have been written?! Only someone witha compatible talent would be even capable of <em>knowing</em> the spell,  let alone recording it! And do you really expect a large portion of unicorns to record all their spells? Besides,  every spellbook would be tiny in that case. Not to mention,  look at the latest episode. Was that written by a unicorn with a talent for banishing mirror pool clones? And what if a unicorn can't find a book written by somepony with a compatible talent? Do they just not learn more than telekinesis? And what about Pumpkin Cake?
<p></p>No,  this interpretation just doesn't make sense.

<p></p>You make very good points.  Incidentally,  this prissy element of honesty could be a chef if an EP.
<p></p>It occurs to me that honest isn't just about telling the truth.  It's about keeping (or trying to keep) promises.  Something to bear in mind I think.

<p></p>That would have pretty much solved all my issues with the episode.
<p></p>Also,  yeah,  Rainbow,  I forgot to say,  good ideas.  Your bearer of Generosity is a lot like Carrot Top from the Lunaverse. I like her a lot.
<p></p>CMC elements? Scootaloo beng loyaly seems appropriate,  but I don't think the other two match teir sisters. Maybe generosity for Applebloom and kindness for Sweetie Belle?

The one trait that seems to separate the ponies from the other sapient quadrupeds is their cutie marks. (There was a preview commercial that aired during the season opener and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">two adult <em>horses</em> showed up in it</span>. One of their flanks was visible,  and didn't have a cutie mark.) Celestia and Luna have cutie marks.

            @Sereg Talents are <em>wide</em> in their coverage,  and tons of spells can fall into multiple talents. Using Rarity as an example again,  she can perform a gem finding spell,  as could a unicorn specializing in geology,  despite the fact that their talents have absolutely no overlap. Also,  none of this precludes specific spells that don't fall into any category,  like the mirror pond spell.
<p></p>As for Pumpkin Cake,  this is about talents,  not cutie marks. Pumpkin can be talented at something at that age,  easily.

            I'm not really seeing a difference over time,  honestly. They still do horse-like things for the most part,  like Twilight trying to roll up her scroll with her nose,  or Fluttershy picking berries for her picnic with her teeth.
