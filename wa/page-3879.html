<p></p>If you want me advice,  and say this fully aware of the irony since I hate FE,  go ahead and finish it. Whatever sadness it may bring,  the <em>not knowing</em> will always be worse. Better to do something and regret then to live with uncertainty and suspense.

            You know,  I can't figure out how that makes me feel.  She's either really cool or really anal for messy writing to be her holdup.  I don't think the writing was messy though,  a little bit at the beginning,  but still really good for fanfiction.

<p></p>Well....<em>it's true</em>
<p></p>I just don't get the hype. FE would be SO MUCH BETTER if it just embraced it's premise and became a campy for epicness fanboy x-over,  but it keeps trying to be serious and deep (Which the author,  in my opinion,  is not good at) that it just makes me roll the eyes.
<p></p>Plus the writing,  as said by others,  is sub-par at best,  and as a literary lover this is a huge turn off to anything for me.

            I don't really have any interest in Fallout Equestria.  To me,  there's little reason for its existence as the two series are incompatible in my eyes.
<p></p>By the way,  could you share that sundress avatar with me,  CDRW?

<p></p>I think that in the end if you don't read it the worry and anxiety of having never seen the whole thing through will far outweigh and out last any sadness you might get from reading. That's just my opinion based on what I know of you though.

            @ Crowing MAJOR SPOILERS! <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dunno what happens to Dash,  she probably dies fighting Gilda but we never find out for sure.  Twilight gets assimilated into the collective before eventually dying after having a nuke go off under the borg queen's nest.  Rarity splits her soul into 43 pieces and dies saving Fluttershy from a megaspell.  Pinkie Pie dies in a megaspell blast.  Applejack lives to an old age in one of the stables and even has a kid.  Fluttershy gets turned into a tree.</span>

            @Crowind:  If you really want to know what happens to all of them then alright.  <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">  Pinkie Pie is killed in one of the initial megaspell attacks on Equestria,  Rarity is killed defending Fluttershy from the attack on Canterlot,  Twilight gets absorbed into the super powerful alicorn Trixie turns into,  Applejack makes it to one of the stables and survives the war,  even having a kid,  Fluttershy got turned into a tree and is eventually revived in the epilogue,  and Rainbow Dash's fate is left hanging.</span>

            @CDRW: Thanks. Well,  that sucks. Not that they die,  but that they pretty much have a part in ruining Equestria.
<p></p>So is it okay to talk about the Daring Do tropes here? I don't really want to alienate other people.
