<p></p>I agree with Red there,  the girls have their strong and weak points,  which makes them all just so relateable. We know that feel.

            I know they're all flawed,  I understand that ,  it just so happens that the flaws RD and Rarity have make me dislike them and the flaws the others have don't bother me to the same degree as the other ones.

            I dunno,  it's RD's flaws that make me not like her. The only thing she has going for her is her loyalty and occasional coolness. But that's bogged down by her arrogance,  unkindess,  etc.

            Let me count the flaws of the others:
<p></p>Twilight is naive,  slightly bossy,  obsessively controlling and organized,  highly neurotic,  and hasn't gotten enough episodes this season.
<p></p>Pinkie is annoying,  loud,  annoying,  erratic,  annoying,  insensitive,  annoying,  has poor communication skills,  is annoying,  and has no sense of common sense.
<p></p>Fluttershy is so meek and spineless she borders having no personality and has such sickeningly sweet and moe attributes I almost hated her instantly.
<p></p>And good old Applejack is... Uninteresting. She has many of Rainbow Dash's flaws but not to an obnoxious extent.

            I wasn't stating what I hated,  I was stating their flaws to demonstrate I am not ignoring them. I don't hate those four even though I notice and acknowledge all of their flaws.

            It's well past by this point,  but Discord can be both evil and not truly malevolent. What he does hurts ponies,  and there's no getting around that. That's bad. But he's doing it not out of spite or malice,  but simply because it's what <em>he</em> enjoys. He's not malevolent,  simply selfish. He can still be,  and indeed is,  completely evil through all that.
<p></p>As for the issue of him going out of his way to mind-rape the girls,  well,  that's pretty chaotic. He wanted things to be different,  and disliked that fluttershy refused to change for him. Pretty simple chaos,  there.
<p></p>I'm not going to touch the issue of flaws myself,  save for saying that yes,  it's good that they all have flaws,  but that still doesn't mean we have to like them. It's perfectly natural to want to see someone overcome their flaws,  or at least dislike them for those flaws.

            I'd consider Applejack and Rainbow to be the least flawed personally.  Neither of them have spent an entire episode going insane,  at least.
<p></p>Fluttershy has some very serious social problems,  but despite this she has five very good friends who look out for her,  so it doesn't really cause her much in the way of problems.
<p></p>Twilight is totally fine most of the time,  but Lesson Zero showed it doesn't take much to push her over the edge.
<p></p>Pinkie has little understanding of others,  is annoying,  and has that whole crazy-depression thing from Party of One.
<p></p>Rarity pretty much just has the one flaw (selfishness) but she never seems to learn no matter how many times it causes her trouble.

<p></p>^That's the thing.  They all have flaws that are,  to greater or lesser extent,  crippling when each girl is taken alone.  Taken as a group,  though,  and they cover for each other's weaknesses and boost each other's strengths.

            Does this mean Big Mac could get some <em>actual dialogue?</em>  Madness!
<p></p>I wonder how this will play out.  The CMC's involvement makes me think it will end if failure,  but Cheerilee and Big Mac are tertiary enough that they could be a couple without altering the tone of the show at all.
<p></p>My opinion of this episode went from hesitant to excited in about five seconds.

            ...Seriously,  this team is full of geniuses.
<p></p>First,  they <em>somehow</em> managed to find the one ship that almost nobody sailed. Second,  they give us more Big Mac,  potentially with more lines,  and last but not least: with the CMC implied,  <em>anything</em> can happen ! That's gonna make bronies insane ! xD
<p></p>If they manage to add <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent">Funny Background Event</a> between Lyra&amp;Bonbon and Whooves&amp;Derpy,  I swear I bring that fucking station back on earth and open a church idolizing them.

            When I heard about the episode,  I kind of took it for granted that none of the main characters would be involved and didn't understand why people were expecting any of the Mane Six to get shipped with anyone. But yeah,  this particular pairing,  I didn't expect. I'm glad for it though. I've been waiting Big Mac to get more focus for ages,  and Cheerilee is fairly win too.

            I was actually kind of thinking Fluttermac. Not hoping for it,  mind you. I honestly don't care about shipping all that much. I just thought: "Yeah,  that would probably work".

            Ah,  man. The things you miss while you are asleep.
<p></p>Anyway to respond to a couple of things. . .
<p></p>A.) Simply because Discord acts in a kind of childish way does not mean he is not pure evil.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> I don't like him as a villain anyway</span>
<p></p>B.) So it Hearts and Hooves is actually going to joss every Big Mac ship out there. Strange,  but. . .sad. . .hey wasn't their a pretty popular fan fic based off of this ship?
