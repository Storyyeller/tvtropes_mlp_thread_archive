            @Kegi I think that's because magical fabrication is temporary. I don't think we've seen anything created wholly out of magic that doesn't poof out of existence sometime later. Weaker transformation spells seem to have similar limitations (i.e. turning mice into horses,  which even then wasn't entirely successful considering how they came out).

            I think it could also be said that editing spells requires one to,  you know,  be able to keep what their editing intact to begin with,  otherwise the spell fails(A reflexive anti-magic on the part of the object?). Fabricated objects can just be slapped together with whatever's laying around,  but in the case of transmutation you need to know the original is still going to be there when it's time to turn back. Requires an immense amount of precision.
<p></p>Which is probably why Gender-changing is harder than age-changing. Age changing alters what's already there,  Gender swappign requires you to both alter some parts and fabricate others,  <em>while</em> keeping them consistent and cohesive with the whole,  <em>without</em> completely eradicating the other bits so that they can change back later.

            Yeah,  that's why I sort of figure most objects will sort of 'no sell' a botched spell rather than getting stuck halfway. Their 'personal magic feild' or what have you detects a incorrect rune or something,  and turns on a natural magic defense. OR something. I dunno. All I know is,  we never see a botched spell,  just one that doesn't happen.

            My headcanon is that Luna attempted to physically age herself up to match her sister,  but got stuck around halfway and decided it was good enough (hence why she looks different than her first appearance,  but is still smaller than Celestia).

            I will give that there seems to be some sort of natural "snapback" effect on transformations,  but they can still go wrong. You can clearly see the snapback in things like Twilight transforming a rock into a tophat,  her initial attempts at transforming the apple,  or her failed attempt at the age spell on the flower.

            That <em>still</em> may not neccesarily count as a botch - Twilight was trying to turn an inanimate object into another.
<p></p>There was probably no consideration given as to the effect it would have on a living creature,  since it was never meant to be used on one.

            Something I noticed in "Magic Duel" but can't recall being pointed out yet: when Snails was turned old with an age spell,  his snail cutie mark turned old as well.

            Yeah i'd say most magic that just makes things appear out of nowhere is limited in how long it can last. And Transformation,  yeah does seem to be the hardets to do.
<p></p>And yes i'm running under age magic to be a transformation tpye,  not a temporal based magic.
