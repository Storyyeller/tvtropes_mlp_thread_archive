            Wait,  what's all the confusion?  Discord misread Fluttershy's weaknesses as problems that she was ashamed and defensive about,  not reasonable flaws that she trusted her friends to make up for and help her through.  He doesn't understand that sort of trust.

            Thoughts on episode 6 S2:
<p></p>Cute,  the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CCs">C Cs</a> are always fun when they show up,  add in Zecora and a pretty good plot and you have a recpie for a good episode.
<p></p>The Cute Pox suquence was funny,  I don't understand why Zecora left AB alone in the hut with the mix knowing all about her "hearts desire" but what eves.
<p></p>Also I thought we already established that Zecora's stuff was herbal remidies and folk cures,  not actual magic. So why do her potions do deciedly magical things all of the sudden?
<p></p>Is there much fanfiction abotu Zecora? She's a rather intresting character,  why did she leave her home land and what was it like there? Why is she so knowledgeable?
<p></p>All over,  a prety great episodel. The Apple Family continue to amuse. Big Mac is definatly the best male so far.

            Speaking of the CC,  what where their implied talents. I think Sweetie Belle's was cleaning,  Scootaloo's well obvious and Apple Blooms was construction.

            @L Mage: I think some of the plants themselves are inherently magical.  Like the Poison Joke or Heart's Desire.
<p></p>@Chadaman: Sweetie Belle's talent is obviously singing.  Scootaloo's is physical stuff like riding her scooter,  and Apple Bloom is vaguely artistic; like doing home decor or painting or things of that nature.

            Sweetie's future cutie mark is in singing,  that's for damn sure.  Scootaloo's is either in general athleticism or in scootering,  and Applebloom's is probably in construction or design.
<p></p>Edit: Well,  given how that poor table turned out,  maybe not construction.

            I find Zecora to be one of the most inresting characters on the show....She should interact with Twilight more....
<p></p>In fact there should be a episode where they vist her homeland.

<p></p>Apple Bloom is a pretty handipony.  I'm fully expecting some sort of construction or design related cutie mark.

            So,  as my name here suggests,  I've been lurking. A lot. I've finally decided to join in the pony discussion for once,  as there's just something about this show that clicks with me. It's probably the fact that it's very character driven,  even given it's typical episodic nature. Most cartoons nowadays have a "1) Put static silly character in silly situation. 2) have silly things happen. 3) ??? 4) Profit." approach to their storytelling. <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a> manages to make it the characters' own attributes that create the situations,  and they have to solve it with the help of the other characters. Even if a plot contrivance creates a situation,  the character themselves causes the plot to develop or advance,  not just a natural progression that the character is reacting to. The fact that the humor is also top notch and harkens back to my childhood also has a lot to do with how awesome this show is.
<p></p>While most anything I watch or read that interests me has me shooting ideas around in my head that could potentially be "fanfiction",  the character driven nature of the show here lets me actually figure out a plot  in a much more coherent manner,  so much so that I'm tempted to actually write something. I just need to get over my internet-bred dislike of fanfics in general first,  as I've been creeped out/disappointed by all of the chaff on the internet that I really want to avoid becoming "one of them",  so to speak. So,  that's my long winded introduction,  hopefully I won't return to lurking forever again.

            Hiya,  Lurker! Welcome to the heard.
<p></p>And don't worry about fanfiction. I was much in the same boat as you when I started in this fandom,  but there are a lot of downright <em>amazing</em> stories out there. It really does help that the main repository fro them has a pretty tight filter,  so only the really good ones get through. <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillSlightlyBitterAboutClothesHangers" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillSlightlyBitterAboutClothesHangers">Even if it is a bit opinion-based</a>.
<p></p>Also,  mage: About the Zecora's magical potions thing... I think it may just have to do with the setting. It seems to me like a lot of the plants are just inherently magical,  or have qualities that seem as such. So naturally,  mixing them together would create magical results. It's still herbal medicine,  the herbs are just a bit more fancy that ours.
