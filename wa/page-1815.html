            No,  it wasn't the Pinkie thing. It was how the first instinct was apparently to go on about how X Y and Z completely outshone Applejack in whatever fashion. For being her fan,  you sure are good at ferreting out ways to logic away her accomplishments as being actual accomplishments. It's just... it's tiring. Sometimes I feel it'd be better to just have a few episodes without her,  because her involvement seems to spark huge rants about how she could have been more awesome,  or how X character is clearly better than her because of [sight gag] and you wish they would do <em>something</em> to make her awesome. But that would probably just spark a rant about her being underutilized and having the fewest focus episodes and... ARGH.
<p></p>She stopped a bus! And moved barely 1 meter in doing so! Why can't we just appreciate what she does instead of lamenting about how it could have been better or seen more often every single episode,  eh?
<p></p>edit: OK,  maybe my true motive was to rant,  myself,  I don't even know anymore.

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">At least they apologized after. </div>
They didn't really apologize for bullying Fluttershy. That,  and it's not really apologizing,  it's more like what bullies do when they are beaten.
<p></p>Can't beat them? Join them. Continue beating everypony else,  though.

            Well,  I think this was definitely the weakest episode of the season,  but I still liked it. Even if t was obvious from about half-way through,  the rest of the Mane Six forming the Mysterious Darkwing Lantern Corps was badass.

<p></p>I think the issue isn't that she isn't doing anything awesome - she is - but rather that what awesome she does is sort of passed over by the audience. Take the discussion from the CMOA page earlier - she's <em>had</em> awesome moments,  but how many of them are up there? I suppose it doesn't help that she's never had realy focus,  and in the one episode she did have focus here CMOA was shown as a bad thing (She would have had to go for <em>days</em>,  almost non-stop. As a student,  I respect that immensly). It might help if she had an episode on her own where she did something pretty cool. She needs her focus episode of the season
