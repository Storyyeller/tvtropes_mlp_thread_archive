            On the topic of anime,  I still fail to see the difference between anime and western animation at its core. As a medium,  cartoons are cartoons. Anime is usually defined by its art style and storytelling conventions. If we were to categorize western animation by its art style and storytelling conventions,  we would have at least a dozen tabs here on <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropes">TV Tropes</a> where we only have one WA tab. Heck,  most Japanese people don't even distinguish between anime and foreign animation. It's <em>all</em> "anime" to them.
<p></p>As for the current topic of conversation... I've got nothin'.

            No,  Orion,  just some of us made some off-color jokes.  I had to talk Surprise into laying down and reading a book to get her mind off of it (seriously,  you want to see her kill someone,  just <em>suggest</em> a child is being menaced).
<p></p>I think I'm gonna take a break and play some <em>King of Fighters</em>.  The thread's kind of winding down it seems.

            @Perpetual Lurker
<p></p>Anime and Cartoons are the same idea in concept... but so are a car and a truck,  or for that matter an airplane and a train.  They accomplish similar goes,  but the devil is in how they go about it,  what thinking and mindsets go into it.
<p></p>I think a large part of the problem is that the internet has perpetuated a very shallow view of what "anime" is.  It's only here,  for example,  that pretenders like Avatar and Teen Titans can pass for the real thing.  What highlights the difference is,  basically,  the attitudes behind the stories and the approach to the format.  Western (or specifically American) animation still hasn't really lost the radio-show inspired "explain what we're seeing" style of writing.  Granted,  its gotten less obnoxious,  but you still have to have Aang highlight what his plan is before he executes it so the viewer is sure to follow the action.
<p></p>That,  to me,  is the big difference:  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation">Western Animation</a> is obsessed with explanations,  and making absolutely sure that you understand what's happening and there is no ambiguity.  Anime on the other hand often relies on you to just "get" things,  and doesn't care if it leaves you a little lost.  I said earlier that I recently discovered <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GensoumadenSaiyuki" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GensoumadenSaiyuki">Gensoumaden Saiyuki</a></em> and the second DVD volume (episodes 6-10) are perfect examples—you often have no effing clue what's going on with the heroes and whether they like each other or not (a viewer with low intuition might even think they hate each other's guts),  and the show never comes right out and says "these are a bunch of good friends acting tough because they're comfortable showing their worse sides to each other."  It just lets you see that for yourself.
<p></p>I think what often confuses these discussions is that they always become about "Anime Good,  WA Bad" and people become defensive over that,  and it cancels out all thought.  I hope that doesn't happen here.  The WA style of overly explaining things has its place and there are a lot of stories where it really works.  It just needs to be pointed out that <em>this</em> is the monumental difference,  and why shows like Avatar aren't quite anime even though they try their best to look like it.

<p></p>Yeah,  but its usually things like what a Maten Scroll is and why its important,  or nuances about how black magic works or some such—stuff that,  in all honesty,  <em>needs</em> exposition.  Not stuff like "I'm going to point out that the villain has no self control so you'll understand why I'm jumping around on his boats while he's throwing fireballs at me."

            Not to mention dubs tend to add a lot of exposition into more subtle anime scripts,  usually in silent scenes,  because western kids obviously like perpetual noise.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue"> Even worse,  they repeat it for unneccessary stuff over and over while missing out important points made in the original.
<p></p>Gets especially annoying in toy gimmick shows like Yu Gi Oh and Beyblade,  there's only so much info you can give on how to strategize with a trading card or spinny disc.

            @Moe I still don't see it. You can't hold an entire country's animation output to those standards,  same as you can't make blanket statements about everything <em>not</em> made in Japan. Every show is different on a case by case basis,  sometimes even within a single show itself.
<p></p>I agree that people jumping on the "Anime &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WA" train of thought with no thought is quite stupid. There is a reason why most people do,  though: You only see the upper end of Japanese Animation get noticed overseas. People outside of Japan only get exposed to the "cream of the crop",  so to speak,  of anime,  while simultaneously being exposed to the entirety of their own country's animation,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw">which is more bad than good</a>.
