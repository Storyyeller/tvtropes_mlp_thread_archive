<p></p>Wow that was a very well made post. I loved your anysis of Trixie,  it seems you are right. Trixie didn't seemed To be a bad pony after all.You changed my perspective if Truxie
<p></p>Trixie seemed like a lonely pony now that you mention it. The inferiority complex part you mentioned makes sense. I have been doing research for that topic for my character guide
<p></p>If you don't mind I would like to put your analysis on the analysis tab :)..

            ^I kind of get the feeling that Twilight's pretty in a nerdy way; the male ponies certainly don't bow and scrape the way they do to Rarity,  but she's probably at least averagely good-looking.
<p></p>Dash strikes me as... well,  no,  she's actually probably at least a bit concerned with her appearance - just toward Cool rather than Beautiful.  She's probably attractive in a rougher,  more natural way.

            I think Dash would be more concerned with "Did I look Awesome doing that?" than her appearance directly.  If she got messed up and so dirty,  she'd at least like to know she looked snazzy going through the mud.

Have we actually seen any unicorns besides Trixie and Twilight do any magic aside from telekinesis?  The only thing I can think of offhand is Rarity's gem finding spell.

            Strictly speaking,  Rarity uses more than simple telekinesis. I mean,  when she puts those decorations on her dresses,  those gems/sequins/what-have-yous don't exactly attach by themselves. And she attached her tail (or what used to be her tail) to Steven's sliced-off mustache.

            I'd probably place Twilight and Dashie on the same level as Applejack: they're just average looking girls to all the other ponies.  BTW,  what makes you consider Pinkie above average?  Seems to me like she's treated the same as Twilight,  Applejack and Dashie.

            I like the idea some fans have (I dont think it's canon) that a unicorn's general magic ability is increased if it has to do with their Cutie Mark. That's how Rarity's spell come up,  and her telekinesis is far more efficient if she is putting together a dress or doing a makeover (gems meaning beauty,  her destiny to bring it).
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> x a bazillion again (I am here too rarely): "Goddess" Celestia - the background story says she was there at creation of the world,  she controls day and night (and this is fairy tale/fantasy,  so the sun needn't be an enormous ball of fusioning gas,  btw). I'd say she clearly count as "sort of divine",  though obviously not in the Christian sense of the word. That she is a physical being is irrelevant; a lot of people thought of their deities as that in the past. When I allow my mind out of "this is a modern fairy tale for little girls; think symbolically" mindset,  I think of her as one of those "cosmic" beings in superhero comics; one of the Asgardians or New Gods or something.
<p></p>BTW,  one of my fun (no) ideas is that people far away from Equestria proper,  especially those with few ways of transporting to Canterlot,  tend to think more of the Princesses as actual deities,  with temples and such,  and that Celestia and Luna find it pretty embarrassing and Equestrian ponies quaint. ("Did I know Celestia? Mare still owes me 12 bits!") Of course,  given that Luna was Nightmare Moon (so to speak) for a millenium,  temples to her might not be NICE places,  which would probably embarrass poor Luna even more.
<p></p>Since I have been talking about shit everyone else was done with long ago,  have a cute Luna &amp; Celestia picture: <a class="urllink" href="http://twilightflopple.deviantart.com/art/Night-Owl-200629837">http://twilightflopple.deviantart.com/art/Night-Owl-200629837<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

<p></p>Edit:  Actually,  Twilight's talent being magic is shown to be because she studied it so hard as a filly.  So maybe it's possible that anypony can be magically gifted,  but they have to start early.

            @ Legend: Well,  thank you. Not sure what the analysis tab is,  but go ahead!
<p></p>As for beauty,  I'd call Twilight at least a Special Average - because in comparison to the other ponies she's sort of middle of the range of cuteness,  but her cuteness goes through the roof whenever she gets excited.

I seem to recall her saying watching Celestia raise the sun was the most amazing thing she'd ever seen.

It wasn't that she was naturally gifted,  it was that she was interested and studied magic on her own,  which led to her talent being magic,  which led to her being powerful.  After all,  she didn't seem all that powerful until her freak out,  which happened at the same that she got her cutie mark.

            ^That kind of magehead is actually pretty common in settings with psychics and mages,  though.  It's not usually the moment the power is granted,  it's the moment when the power finally breaks free of its mental blocks or whatever and surges forth like an oil well.

<p></p>BTW,  for some reason I feel that the various pony breeds would work very well in a bog-standard fantasy RPG as balanced "races",  and unicorn magic is part of this.

            ^^I'd guess so,  yeah.  It's hard to tell what exactly drives passions and such for anyone,  really,  even in real life,  so there's no telling whether it's 'predetermined' or whatever.

            To me,  Twilight is the most attractive by far. It's her eyes,  and her <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HimeCut" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HimeCut">Hime Cut</a>. And her voice. The rest are cute,  but... hm... let me see my order of preference
<p></p>1.Twilight <br>2. Rainbow <br>3. Pinkie <br>4. Flutter <br>5. Rarity. <br>6. Apple.
<p></p>I guess I find overt feminity a turnoff,  especially when weaponized (couldn't help but admire her style,  but if the setting had been a little more cynical I think her whining would have resulted in some broken teeth or even mutilation). Fluttershy is very appeasing and nice to be around,  but she's kind of boring. Pinki and Dash,  on the other hand,  have this raw energy to them... In this show,  when do fillies grow into mares,  I wonder?
<p></p>As for Apple,  I really really don't go for the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuckleberryAnn" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuckleberryAnn">Huckleberry Ann</a> (WARNING,  possibly NSFW) look.I just don't find it my heart to be attractive. Too many bad cultural associations...

            I think that celestial bodies as cutie marks correlate to a Unicorn's talent being magic.
<p></p>Celestia and Luna have the sun and the moon and are probably the strongest magic users on the show.
<p></p>Twilight has the star and we know her talent is magic.
<p></p>Trixie has a crescent moon if I recall correctly and she certainly has more than a single spell which Twilight says most Unicorns have. That's probably not counting telekinesis though.

</li><li> 3. Rainbow Dash
</li><li> 4. Rarity
</li><li> 5. Pinkie Pie
</li><li> 6. Twilight
</li></ul><p></p>Fluttershy is just too cute for words and I love how soft and shy she is. Applejack has that adorable accent and I really like freckles. Rainbow Dash is cute in an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Adorkable" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Adorkable">Adorkable</a> kind of way. I don't think Rarity is that pretty,  but she's so ultra cute in A Dog And Pony Show. Pinkie Pie really isn't my type. Twilight seems to be the most plain,  probably because she's supposed to be the nerd of the group
<p></p>Also,  Where would you guys put Trixie on the scale of beauty? cuz I think she's so adorably cute (listen to the way she says Neigh-sayers,  I almost squealed D'awwwww)
