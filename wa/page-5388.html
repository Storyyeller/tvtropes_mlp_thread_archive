            and...that is...exactly what happened.
<p></p>Also Stry was right,  even for an episode as awesome as this,  we're still pretty slow in the thread and a whole lot of the more regualr posters all said g'night right after it aired. huh,  silly time zones.
<p></p>but really,  this episode handled Rainbow PERFECTLY,  sure she want's the record and will push every pony to get it,  but she cares more about Fluttershy,  she doesn't give a flying feather if Fluttershy is as good as everypony else,  she just wants her to do her best and have faith in herself.
<p></p>Sure she was a bit brash at first and just dismissed Flutter's initial concerns,  but once she saw just how scared she was about it,  she stopped pushing,  and no matter how bad Fluttershy did she was supportive of her for even trying,  and making the improvement she did. And you could tell she was <em>genuinely</em> pleased about her increase in wingpower,  not just trying to make her feel better.
<p></p>And right after,  when Fluttershy ran away with Rainbow chasing her,  trying to talk to her,  the instant Fluttershy turned around and Dash saw she was in tears...that expression...you knew right then all RD was thinking about was how can she help her friend,  it wasn't about records,  or even about the tornado at all,  She saw her friend hurting and just wished she knew how to make her feel better.

            I still find it to be an unsatisfying episode because they title and summary were misleading. you're free to disagree but I still don't think I'm in the wrong for being upset.

            ...that's like saying Sisterhooves Social was a disappointing episode becuase the entire episode didn't take place at it.
<p></p>Or The Best night Ever lied since the ponies had bad nights.
<p></p>Hell if ANYTHING you should be upset over becuase the ONE synopsis you based your entire <em>assumption</em> of the episode on proved false,  it's that it was a Tornado,  not a hurricane.

<p></p>The episode title and the summary made the tornado out to be more important than it actually was. That's my issue with the episode and why I find it disappointing.

            @Seraphem:
I also really liked that Rainbow Dash didn't really care much for the record in end and felt that it was still important to get the water up to Cloudsdale.
<p></p>@Badwolfwho
I really liked it. Probably up there in my top 10 episodes of the season. Although I loved Fluttershy and the episode was clearly more on her,  I was actually really impressed with Rainbow Dash. I liked that she was trying to support Fluttershy the entire time and that she felt that getting the water up to Cloudsdale in the end was more important than breaking the record or impressing Spitfire.

            I really liked this episode. But the premise for the CMC episode sounds really interesting as well. I wonder what they found out? I read a WMG that they found out Twilight had a brother. So I think there's a relatively high chance that the premise for A Canterlot Wedding will be revealed.

            The previews during the new episode make Ponyville Confidential seem like the usual "kids talk about characters' secrets and get everyone upset" thing. They showed Fluttershy,  Twilight,  and AJ upset about the column.

            Chariot,  as far as I can tell,  you are the only person who thought that,  and I can't imagine how there being more tornado in the episode would have made it better.

            I'm guessing that the CMC will use their column to make DT and SS's lives miserable then inadvertently other ponies' and we'll all learn a valuable lesson that we should only make people that we don't like miserable.
