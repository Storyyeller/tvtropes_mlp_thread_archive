            An ideal looking guy,  huh? Huh... this is a chance for me to draw good-looking guys,  <em>and</em> good looking girls! Hurrah!
<p></p>Just to check on established personalities: They all do <em>like</em> guys,  right? there's none of them that's a straight lesbian(As far as I recall Dash is Bi and Pinkie is Pan,  but beyond that I can't recall)?

            Hi everyone. I see the Thor sockpuppet is back.
<p></p>Also,  Rarity is one of my favorite ponies for the same reasons JT and Bag pointed out. Like most people,  she struggles with the differences between the pony she wants to be and the pony she is. It makes her seem a lot more <strike> human</strike> realistic.

            Huh. that's actually a quite interesting thread.
<p></p>Put a certain way,  Rarity seems a bit akin to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wicked" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wicked">Glinda</a> - she's a bit abrasive and honestly kind of a bitch at times,  but she <em>does</em> mean well. At least,  that's her core nature. She seems to be actively trying to smooth out her wrinkles,  which as someone who's struggled to do the same I can greatly appreciate.
<p></p>I still hold the theory that Rarity's parents got rich very very suddenly,  and she's got a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledSweet" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledSweet">Spoiled Sweet</a> thing going on.

            I started watching the show because my friend recommended it to me. He also introduced me to Doctor Who,  Minecraft,  and Adventure Time. He's a pretty cool guy.

            Exactly; The other characters totally do that,  but for some reason it's more obvious when Rarity does it.  Part of the reason I liked "Sweet and Elite" so much was that she never really needed to get the lesson pointed out to her to realize that she was messing up.  I know a lot of people complain that she got away with lying,  but it's obvious the whole way through that she feels guilty about it.

            You are correct Kegi,  no one in the Mane six is a straight up lesbian.
<p></p>And you just hand me your question any time you're ready,  I'm in a drawing mood,  got my bed,  my Netflix,  my clipboard,  nothing can ruin this moment.
<p></p>And I suppose I don't hate Rarity and RD as much as I say,  I just have no love for narcissists,  egotists,  the conceited,  the arrogant,  the self aggrandizing,  unless there's some level of irony behind it. My dislike simply grew as more and more reasons were created by the series for me to dislike them more.
<p></p>It's like near the beginning I was,  at worst,  annoyed at them,  and nowadays I feel like smacking them upside the head. Yeah I would,  egalitarianism is a mo-fo especially if the person's annoying enough.

            It's sorta like how some viewers wanted Rainbow Dash to admit that she didn't know anything about rainbows in "The Runaway Rainbow",  but I think she figured it out just fine.

            How did I get into MLP?  Well,  I suppose it started when a friend of mine was watching it and mentioned it had Tara Strong.  The internet was also going nuts over it too,  so I decided to check it out for myself just to see if it was worthy of all the praise it had received.  While the show started out as a guilty pleasure,  I quickly became a bigger brony than the friend who initially introduced me to the show.

            Storyyeller,  you should be glad I cannot reach through this internet and throttle you. Also,  Sky Strike,  I'm not sure what you mean by "sockpuppet". In my land,  it means an old sock redressed for the amusement of children,  but perhaps it means something different here.

<p></p>Well it just made me a little annoyed with the writers. Why can't you write an ep this well for somepony like Applejack? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            @ilsemmr I found out about its existence through <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowYourMeme" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowYourMeme">Know Your Meme</a>,  Discord intrigued me,  decided to try watching it.
<p></p>Decided to try watching the first season auf Deutsch,  but my curiosity was peaked further and I started watching English videos on mute with subtitles,  then found this forum and started watching the new episodes in English sound,  starting with Hearts and Hooves Day.
