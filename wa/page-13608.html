            In universe Twi or Cadance are probably fourth most important alicorn.  Twi is new and Cadance wasn't so important she couldn't be shunted off to the Crystal Empire.  Just because we never see Luna do anything doesn't mean she isn't important.
<p></p>On a related note,  maybe now that Twi is an alicorn we'll see more of Celestia and Luna.

            I finally got to see it,  and I liked it pretty much.  I'd say that if the end of the episode is any indication,  I don't think Twilight's personality is necessarily going to change just because she got wings,  given her question about there being a book on how to be a princess.  She just better not find the book G3 Spike used and try to follow all of THOSE rules! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16"> Although I wouldn't be surprised if Rarity at all tried to teach Twilight to be more "princess-like" or thought that things would be more like the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessClassic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessClassic">Princess Classic</a> trope and then was proved wrong by someone like Celestia.  I also like that it showed that she's still best friends with the others and the reaction is to cheer for her gaining her wings (and they actually used the fan term "alicorn"),  especially Pinkie's reaction where she swings through with fake wings and a party hat for a horn and Rainbow Dash now is excited to have another flying buddy!  I was also glad to see Twilight's parents appear again too,  since that certainly is that kind of event that her parents should be there to celebrate with her.
<p></p>By the way,  another place where someone takes a drink in order to spit it out is in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a> where Homer looks at the price of a computer calmly,  takes a sip of coffee and then looks at the price tag again and THEN he spits it out.

            Ya know,  I just realized something. If the speculation about Rarity becoming <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nightmare Moon</span> in the comics comes true,  and it takes place before MMC (the editor said we wouldn't see Alicorn Twilight for a while,  since Hasbro didn't tell IDW about it before the <em>official</em> announcement),  it may make Rarity's comment about not knowing you could become an alicorn kinda odd if she herself becomes an alicorn for a short while.

<p></p><ol><li> Alicorn,  as in the name of the species,  is 100% canon now.

</li><li> This is going to go down as the one episode of MLPFIM that had the most songs to it hands-down.
</li><li> Now we know what that book involving Starswirl The Bearded at beginning of Season 3 was about...it was about Twilight actually succeeded where Starswirl had failed and surpassing him.
</li><li> Princess Celestia can sing? I didn't think she had it in her! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_surprised.png" height="16" width="16" alt="surprised" title="surprised">
</li></ol><p></p>Still,  it does leave a number of questions hanging. What role is Discord going to play in the next season? Where is Twilight going to live now? Is Derpy going to come back into a speaking role again?
<p></p>It's going to interesting to see what happens next! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin">

            On Derpy,  I'm glad she's back. I wouldn't put money on her talking again anytime soon,  but at least the more paranoid fans <em>should</em> stop saying "Hasbro hates Derpy!". I mean <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/MyLittlePony/status/302863727173197824">the official twitter<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> posted a picture of one of her cameos.
<p></p>Also,  the Facebook page posted a music video of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10100116170036359&amp;set=vb.118429394841173&amp;type=2&amp;theater">"True,  True Friend"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  that's a little shorter and excludes the talking sections.
<p></p>Can I just add I'm glad they made sure to give Shining Armor a few lines? He could have just made a silent cameo,  but its a nice touch he spoke.

            Just finished the episode,  usual complaints and praises and so on.
<p></p>However,  was I the only one who heard the crowd calling her "Twilight <em>Comet</em>" rather than Twilight Sparkle in the Coronation song?

            I really hope that season 4 is as different as this episode makes it look like it's going to be. In my opinion,  the show is starting to wear a bit thin on its original premise and is due for some fresh blood. That said,  I think it still has enough life left in it to provide one more good season even if nothing really substantial changes.

            <span class="blue">Personally I think the Studio was shocked at the random backlash that happened after Derpy's voiced cameo,  and made the perfectly reasonable decision to not tempt fate and cut down on her appearances for awhile.  Now that the heat has died down,  they'll probably go back to doing little cameos of her here and there.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">I don't expect to see another voiced cameo though,  not after the ingratitude they were shown for it last time.</span>

            I was kind of dissapointed by this episode actually. It felt rushed. Now it's to my knowledge that this is actually a 3-parter,  with parts 2 and 3 comin' in Season 4. So will see what happnes then. Maybe it'll be good,  maybe not.
<p></p>Until then it will be my personal Headcanon that this was all a self-indulgent fanfic written by Twilight. Take that however you like.
<p></p>Also,  I liked how Celestia actually got a song in this one.
