            Yeah,  two is definitely stretching it - and as good as "Return of Harmony" was,  look at how rushed several sections felt.  Granted,  they might have had more space with three episodes,  but they might also not have had enough content for three full episodes; my point is that pacing was an issue for this season's two-partner,  basically,  and I'm fairly sure that that would have carried over for a three-parter,  too.
<p></p>Basically,  we have one-shots,  two-parters and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> (if ever) as our length options,  I think.

            I agree that the main problem that the ROH episodes had was the pacing; the stuff in the maze went by too quickly.  And yeah,  Discord picked up an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> at the end.  Could've been worse,  though.

<p></p>You are?  Let's just test that:
<p></p>Discord sucks,  Pinkie Pie is the cutest smartest all around best pony,  and Applejack needs to be <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>!

<p></p>"he's overpowered" is really just a small part of the overall problem.

But if you can't read all that,  the key points are as followed:
<p></p>1.  The whole premise of "The Return of Harmony" is just not a good fit—it felt like I was watching a completely different cartoon.  The Mane Six became <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAvengers" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a>,  available at a moment's notice to fight evil,  while the villain was presented beginning-to-end as an evil force that had to be stopped,  which again would make sense in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAvengers" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a> but is just out of tune with MLP.
<p></p>2.  Discord is a cheap,  lazy and uncreative idea for a villain that,  worse,  wasn't executed very well—he made a few good jokes,  but for the most part he comes off as completely one-note,  and its hard to believe he's seriously a threat (no offense,  but one thing you don't seem to understand is that,  just saying "he's a god" doesn't automatically make him powerful or threatening or excuse all his shortcomings—his portrayal has to be convincing or all the excuses in the world just don't work).
<p></p>3.  Since Twilight quotes her letter from "The Cutie Mark Chronicles, " if I accept Return of Harmony as canon I have to also accept the worst episode of the series as canon.  Ergo...
<p></p>4.  I repeat,  Discord is presented beginning-to-end simply as an evil force that has to be locked up,  which is not how MLP usually operates.  All the other "villains" (Trixie,  Gilda,  the Buffalo,  hell even Nightmare Moon) in this show are usually more fleshed out and have something redeemable about them,  and the mane cast usually don't directly draw clear lines of good and evil against them.  With Discord they do,  never even considering redemption or reasoning with him as an option,  and that's just jarring.  Again I repeat,  it makes the whole episode feel like it comes from a completely different cartoon.
<p></p>5.  Subtle nods and references I'm okay with,  but I hate blatant pop-culture shout-outs,  so the Star Wars ending really didn't sit well with me.
<p></p>That's about it.

I'm afraid I have to agree with this bit. Especially for his ep. 2 appearance.
<p></p>But that's not what this post is for!
<p></p><hr>
<p></p>Finally caught <em>Sisterhooves Social</em>. I think I can call this my (tentative) favorite episode for season 2,  I liked it <em>that</em> much. Most likely for the plot being a massive sibling argument that ends in "Aww,  look,  they really do care about each other!"

            Kyler: Everypony can make mistakes,  even star athletes like Dashie and AJ.  All it takes is one bad misstep to end up face down in the mud (and she fell right at the beginning of the pit).  Case in point: see AJ hitting the barrel during her Fall Weather Friends run.
<p></p>Oh and one thing I really love about that mud pit: Sweetie being so light weight she can just hop across the surface.  She's just so incredibly cute in that scene. :3

            @Moe Dantes: I disagree with you there.
<p></p>1. Ok,  fair enough,  It was a change from the norm,  But I liked the diference. Perhaps not all the time,  but the odd action episode spices things up.
<p></p>2. I like that kind of villan. Though I don't like how he was defeated due to holding the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">idiot ball</a>. I would have prefered it if the mane 6 beat them by their skill,  not Dicord goofing. And I did see Discord as a threat myself because of the fact he is a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a>.
<p></p>3.I had no issue with "The Cutie Mark Chronicles" myself. It wasn't the best episode,  but I fail to see any real problems with it. (actually,  I would like to know why people do dislike it,  else I feel like I'm missing something important)
<p></p>4. Yes,  Discord was pure evil,  but I personally would dislike all villans to be of the 'more misunderstood than evil' kind,  and for a kids show,  there are not many other kinds that the kids will get,  or that will be allowed. Again,  I like variety.
<p></p>5. Actually,  I agree with this one. ^_^
<p></p>I liked discord as a Villan. The only issue I had was that he was defeated due to his cockiness more than the Mane 6 efforts. (which REALLY bugged me... It felt that they wasted a pefectly good villan).

<p></p>I didn't,  but I should have,  since Applejack's eyes are the thing that stand out most about her.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I don't mind the occasional adventure episode as long as the series a whole doesn't switch tones. I thought it was a nice change of pace.</div>
<p></p>What bothers me isn't that its an adventure episode,  its that the whole premise kicks off with Celestia calling them specifically to fight a villain.  If the situation were some sort of diplomacy like in Dragonshy,  it would make sense,  but it's just jarring that she's treating a nerd,  a dressmaker,  a vet,  a farmer,  and a baker as her own personal fighting force.
<p></p>To put it another way,  imagine if there was an episode of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doug" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doug">Doug</a> where Doug,  Skeeter,  Roger and Patty were hired by the government to take down terrorists... and it <em>wasn't</em> just one of Doug's imaginary adventures.

            ^Exactly.  When the girls took up the Elements,  they broke Celestia's remaining connection with them - Celestia <em>can't</em> use the Elements anymore,  and neither could anyone else.  They were the only ones who could use the only tools that would seal Discord again.
