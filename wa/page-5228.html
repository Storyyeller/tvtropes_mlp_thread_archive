            I watch friendship is magic but it barely gets a chuckle out of me a lot of the time and moreso introduces interesting ideas than a funny show,  sans Sweetie Bot whose Pepisode was pretty fun overall. I prefer the mentally advanced series and it's spin off Rainbow Dash presents. Best version of Rainbow to exist as far as I know.

            Rainbow also spends basically all of her life flying. The only thing she does that doesn't have anything to do with flying is reading. After all,  practice makes perfect. And she sure does a lot of practicing.

            @Bluespade,  Why? I doubt you'd like her considering I hate canon RD and you love her. Mentally Advanced Rainbow is still attention seeking but is also an entirely well meaning goofball that rambles a lot. About as dumb as canon Rainbow but not as annoying,  furthermore she isn't abrasive or a jerk,  just a little naive. She just seems like such a cool person to hang with.

<p></p>4. <strong>I got a Rainbow Dash</strong> <em><strong>YAY</strong></em>
<p></p>5. pagetopper reminds me of an idea I had,  WE should do some <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MSTings" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MSTings">MS Tings</a> of fanfics,  cause lets face it,  we're tropers,  picking apart works is what we do.
<p></p>6. I agree with Story,  FIW is great,  but they went way to overboard with Luna's voice,  I get they wanted to make clear why no pony wanted to spend time with her,  but you have to make sure the <em>audience</em> will still want to.

            You know,  we haven't actually seen RD in any sort of leadership capacity yet,  so we don't really have any idea how she would fair. This should be an interesting bit of character insight for her.

<p></p>And I always figured RD was the pony in charge of all weather in the ponyville area,  so anything comes up involving weather she's the one that leads it.

            I personally think that its just that RD is good at inspiring others.
<p></p>She's kind of like a female <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GurrenLagann" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GurrenLagann">Kamina</a> in that regard.

            Oh yeah,  forgot about that. In that case why wouldn't she be chosen to lead this project? It looks like she has Twilight on the technical side of things,  too,  so it shouldn't be a problem.

            I think that Rainbow Dash is probably a good leader. As for lounging around,  well,  athletes can get really weird schedules. Since they train a lot,  they not only eat a lot,  but they also need a lot of time to recuperate. After all,  everytime you exercise,  you are actually breaking apart the ligaments in your muscles little by little. That's why you're always sore for a few days after extensively exercising.
<p></p>Any good athlete will tell you that you need lots of rest. My dad runs marathons, and training plans will ALWAYS leave you a lot of time to do nothing while you recuperate from both competitions and simple practice runs and work outs.
