<p></p>It's looking much better! You've really improved. I wouldn't say that the colors are flat,  but I think that you should try experimenting with more shading and highlights.

            Yep. I wrote it back in the summer of 2011 when the fandom was new(er) and I had a lot more freetime. I originally submitted it to the Equestria Gaming 16bit game contest (though that wasn't the only reason I wrote it) but unfortuantely,  the contest got cancled and my game was never publicly announced.

            Well it's pretty short (only 4 levels),  but that doesn't mean it's a bad game. I originally planned to make it longer,  but I ran out of motivation.

<p></p>Sorry,  no sound. Not only would it be really complicated to write a sound driver,  but the physics was already taking up nearly all the processing power of the GBA,  at least on my emulator. It actually took a lot of optimization before I could get it to run in real time. In fact,  it still lags if you manage to set up certain physics interactions,  but AFAIK,  that's only possible at one point in the game.
<p></p>And even if I could add sound,  it'd just be sound effects ripped from Portal. I'm not exactly much of a composer.

<p></p>Nope. In fact,  I haven't worked on any games since March 2012. I always seem to get busy with other stuff.

It's not as funny as the author probably would hoped,  but the idea of original characters ending up how they do is an interesting concept. And it's kind of sad if you think about the implications.

<p></p>I think you're better off teaching yourself if you can. I was largely self taught,  though my mother introduced me to the basics as a kid.

            I'm not certain I'd agree with that. Then again,  I'm not wholly certain I'd disagree,  either. My course had several scripting classes,  and the school I took it at had a Video Game Programming Degree as well. I can definitely say I felt what I learned was useful - having someone who can show you where you're going wrong is definitely a great help. That said,  at the same time you'll be doing the vast majority of your work on your own,  and you'll pretty much have to make things up from scratch anyways(Or at least get good at recognizing what snippets to stitch into where - I recall one of my professors admitting that he had a tendency to hold onto sections of code that would do specific things and just appropriate them for whatever he was working on,  and as they say: Good programmers borrow,  great programmers steal). Teachers just make learning the language and a few tricks easier,  and they encourage the mindset of brainstorming. You can trust me when I say that in ANY video game discipline,  teamwork and communication are both the most vital,  and the least utilized asset. My job,  my actual literal job is to find out what's wrong with video games. My title has 'consultant' right in it. I have been asked for my opinions on the game all of once.

            Can you at least mention the company? Or would that be too much?

            Online,  yes. I'm an outsourced employee,  working for the company at the behest of my actual employer,  a media consultant company. Part of the Non-Disclosure Agreement I entered into upon working for the company is that I'm not actually allowed to say that I work for this company. I'm less stringent about it in person,  where it's easier to make it known that I'm not actually an employee,  but online it's a bit more suspect. Besides,  even if I could the company I'm at is relatively new,  so telling you them would make it easy to figure out which game I'm on,  and that's <em>definitely</em> against my contract.
<p></p>One of the problems with working in the entertainment industry,  particularly the video games industry where information is so tightly coveted is that I'm simply not allowed to talk about my job. Even once the game has been announced what we're allowed to say is regulated by marketing departments. Especially in my case,  a breach of contract could end with me losing my job,  and possibly getting blackballed in the future.
