            @Lurker I agree with you Celestia is not very distant. But I think the problem is that there is still a barrier with her.
<p></p>Twilight looks at her first as teacher/mentor and secondly as a friend. Same with the rest of the cast they all look at her first as the princess and secondly as friend (if at all)
<p></p>No one so far looks at her as a friend first (with the possible exeption of Luna). I am sure Celestia would like to be closer to them however.

            @Lurker I didn't see how they were close at all. but I'll concede your point for the sake of brevity.
<p></p>Still,  Celestia has rarely ever been on the submissive side of anything,  and have you noticed that during the rare times when she is,  she's always confused,  scared,  or angry about it. Rarity kissing her hooves or Discord for examples.
<p></p>She might have a bit of Twilight's stickler for plans attitude in her
<p></p>I don't know,  I'm not sure if she's used to being on the recieving end of things anymore. It's like so litle doesn't go according to plan anymore.

            I was just starting to get excited about the supposed Season 3 news.  Oh well,  hat off to a good troll I guess.  So this means no Scootaloo episode confirmed,  huh?  It's weird how much I'm looking forward to one,  considering a few weeks ago my opinion of Scoots was essentially 'meh.'
<p></p>@Ginger: For what it's worth I'd be quite happy to see a Celestia episode where she remained capable and competent throughout.  I agree flaws are very important to making a good character but I think this show actually OVERDOES it a lot,  like when we have episodes like Mysterious Mare Do Well (and Cranky Doodle? still haven't seen it myself) that exaggerate the characters flaws and end up making them unlikable.  You CAN have a good story about a character getting things done competently,  it's just a lot harder to write.
<p></p>Anyway,  much as I'd like to join the discussion my head is killing me,  I'm gonna go take a scalding hot shower to try and cure it.

            I think the main issue with Celestia is that her role in the show basically requires her to be more or less infallible most of the time.  She basically has to be the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a>,  and introducing too many flaws could throw off the cast dynamic.  I'd love to see an episode that gets inside Celestia's head,  but the writers are rather limited in how far they can go.  It's why I think something like a "Celestia goes on vacation" episode would be a good idea; it allows a sort of conflict to take place (if ponies don't recognize that she's the Princess) without removing an important aspect of her character.
<p></p>A nice way of doing it would be to have Celestia try to resist that aspect of her character,  she goes on vacation so she doesn't have to act as a peacemaker or whatnot,  and finds it difficult not to get involved.
