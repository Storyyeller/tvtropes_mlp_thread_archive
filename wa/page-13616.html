            @Perpetual I read your thing about the whole "spark" thingy...when I read that,  I sort of thought of that merch-pony Princess Skyla,  and how if the whole needs a spark to awaken,  then maybe Skyla or some other <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitue" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitue">Suspiciously Similar Substitue</a> could go there. But idk if Skyla will ever appear in show or not,  since the only evidence I've ever seen of her is a pic of a so-soft newborn.

<p></p><em>Strong: Well the good news is,  Twilight is going to stay Twilight. She is overwhelmed and surprised and grateful for this new phase in her life but it’s not going to change how she is or how she interacts with her friends,  she’s staying in Ponyville. I’m certainly not changing any of my performance and it’s really the same Twilight except she can do more stuff now. She can fly…it’s not going to change the overall feel of the show,  she’s going to be with the Mane 6. It’s just Twilight but a little bit better,  she can do more stuff! But overall,  it’s not really going to change that much. I think that’s what everybody’s afraid of,  that it’s going to change sort of that core element that everyone fell in love with these six characters and that’s not going to change at all. I’m not changing a thing about my performance.</em>

<p></p>Your flesh becomes more than mortal and partakes of the divine vigor enjoyed by the gods themselves. Your epic-level companions are fast,  strong,  and smart,  but you have the spark of godhood that sets you ever so slightly above all mortals.

Upon ordering your mortal affairs,  <strong>the astral flame smouldering within you detonates,  consuming all that remains of your mortal flesh.</strong> <br>The astral flame leaves behind a fledgeling god,  flush with the power only the truly divine can comprehend and wield. You ascend,  blazing like the sunrise. <strong>Streaking into the Astral Sea,  you are taken up into the realm of an established god</strong> who welcomes your strength.</div>

            <div class="quoteblock">Granted this episode has no real antagonist,  but there's no real sense of panic or danger when Twilight realizes she can't reverse it. Throw in a third act which really seems disconnected from the tone of the first two,  and everything feels really disjointed. </div>
<p></p>It felt like the first half of the episode is the plot of the entire normal episode or two by itself.

<p></p>I dunno,  that would strike me as unnecessarily sadistic and out-of-character for Twilight,  subjecting her friends to additional physical and emotional stress while hoping for a lucky "roll of the dice",  as it were.

<p></p>Not really. It would take on average 120 tries. So it's more like trying to brute force a two digit pin number.
