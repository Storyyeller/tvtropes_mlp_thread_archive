            Man,  that <em>Thief</em> thread I made in the Video Games forum is still non-stop bitching.
<p></p>I started on a <em>Thief</em> crossover fic once. Kinda a shame I sort of put that on the wayside and proceeded to work on my FOE thing instead.

<p></p>Thought I generally ignore the VG subforum because I'm not really into videogames enough.  I'm perpetually a few years behind the curve because I'm cheap and I wait until the prices drop.  I'd much rather wait a few years and pay thirty bucks for the game with all the DLC included than buy the vanilla game for sixty and have to buy the DLC separately.

            @Pannic: Ugh,  still? I'd have thought after gameplay was revealed and it was made clear that action was the wrong way to go,  and only to be used as a last resort,  they'd have chilled out a bit. It's as if having any sort of combat <em>at all</em> is some sort of crime.

            @syd's claim of the VG forums being bad:  I'd like to say that I have <em>yet</em> to see any <em>real</em> bickering upon the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwarfFortress" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a> thread,  but then again,  that may be the exception,  as opposed to the standard.
<p></p>Anyways,  getting back to pony-related business...  Looking at the bit,  would you say it's made of pure gold,  or made of some other metals?
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_down.png" alt="[down]" title="[down]" height="16" width="16">To that,  I must say is a point <em>well spoken</em>.

            <div class="quoteblock">Anyways,  getting back to pony-related business... Looking at the bit,  would you say it's made of pure gold,  or made of some other metals?</div>
Could go either way. If we assume that the total quantity of gold is comparable to what we have on Earth,  then pure gold bits would be worth more than we've been shown. (Two solid gold coins,  at Earth gold value,  for a single cherry?) But,  considering how ridiculously common gemstones are,  it's definitely possible that gold is equally plentiful.
<p></p>On the other hand,  gold is <em>dense</em> and therefore heavy. Unless we chalk it up to pony superstrength,  weight would make it impractical to carry more than a few solid gold coins at a time.

            Either that or gold is just more common and ponies have superstrength.  Or the coins just look gold but have little inherent value.

            Should the gold on the bit be worth less than the bit itself? Although I guess you could scrap off the leaf and paint the remainder gold,  then stockpile the leaf until you have enough to actually be worth something.

            Afternoon folks.
<p></p>So I saw EQG earlier today,  and thought it was fairly entertaining.  Basically any scene involving Twi acting like a complete spaz was good,  and there were a lot of those.  My only real problems with the movie were some plot issues (So Fluttershy finds a crown that must look freakishly expensive,  and rather than put it in lost and found,  Celestia puts it up as the prize for Fall Formal?  The dance is in three days,  why don't you already have a crown?  Why does the Element of Magic behave the way it does?) and the lack of development of the new characters.  Was there a point to the fact that Flash is Sunset's ex?  I don't remember the two sharing screen time,  let alone dialogue.  And since when is Twilight all "gosh,  I get so flustered just <em>talking</em> to a boy!"
<p></p>Re bits:  They're actually chocolate coins.

<p></p>That just requires markings in the gold which are part of the value.
<p></p>Then again,  <em>that</em> would make it really easy to accidently destroy your own cash.

            The crown actually looked nearly identical to the crown the school <em>did</em> have. Bit of a coincidence,  but alternate dimensions I guess. Flash being Sunset's Ex <em>may</em> have been an attempt to give him some character by suggesting that he's one of the few people who's not afraid of her and doesn't put up with her shit,  though it's a bit telly admittedly.
<p></p>As for why the crown does what it does... fuck if I know. I'd honestly have liked for the mechanics of that to be explained more in depth.
