            A lot of people have that one as their favorite.
<p></p>It is,  funnily enough,  probably one of the worst episodes to use for introducing the show to someone.
<p></p>In other non-news,  I've finished chapter 5 of my stupid story and I'm gonna upload it to ff.net. Then I'll send it into blog pony.

            Lol yeah,  a lot of the main 6 might come off as Mary Sues if you saw that one first.  I call that proof that just because something's a prequel doesn't mean that you should watch it first.

I know,  it's almost too adorable for me!  Fluttershy's song strikes me as a mixture of The Little Mermaid's Part of Your World and that song from Dexter's Laboratory: "This place is new! This place is huge! And so secret from the world!"  I even love how she ends it with that corny line "I love everything!"
<p></p>And halfway through,  I think "Oh yeah,  this is Pinkie Pie's <em>speaking</em> voice singing!"

            The first episode where I found myself eagerly watching multiple times was "Party of One."
<p></p>Also,  I've just sent in the <a class="urllink" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yyRKtXKGESBuqZxs4rXXTtQt3kLpXFT900UU6x3lpco/edit?hl=en_US#">newest chapter<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to blog pony. Hopefully this time I didn't make some kind of error with the submission. And hopefully this chapter is better-received. In any case,  hopefully this'll dispel those bizarre Ayn Rand remarks...

            I'm slowly working my way through the two hundred previous pages of this topic I missed.  One thing that pops out at me is that all the "ponychan" links are dead.  Another is that most users REALLY hate a certain "grimdark" Pinkie Pie story.  Personally I find the idea of Pinkie Pie playing at being <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax Crazy</a> to be rather amusing,  and it makes me wonder if the show's writers will respond to the fandom in some way,  like revealing Pinkie to be a big fan of horror stories,  and having it be a way in which she scares the other ponies without meaning to.  I could see it teaching some layered lessons by the end.
<p></p>Although she's already started sharing the Ax Crazy preconception with Fluttershy:

            Normally her parties are "Bring everyone and their grandma!" types. Gummy's birthday was invitation-only,  I gather,  and even if she wanted to Pinkie couldn't have given out anymore the way she was doing it.

            @Pannic Yea,  I realize that it is a really bad intro episode and that makes me kind of sad,  but on the other hand,  it would probably lose a lot of impact if it was somehow changed to not require familiarity with the main six.
<p></p>The two people I successfully got into the series I actually managed to persuade having the pilot as part of the line up.  For my first friend,  he was willing to watch 4,  so I risked the pilot and did pilot,  Winter Wrap Up,  Sonic Rainboom.  I think I was slowly persuading him episode by episode,  but Fluttershy's yaying completely sealed the deal.  Then after THAT,  I showed him the Cutie Mark Chronicles,  which basically took that seal,  locked it with a key,  buried the key,  then built a house of the key.  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaphorgotten" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaphorgotten">Then the... uh,  episode moved into the house... I guess?</a>.  The other watched 1-3 straight through and she was hooked on the cuteness and relatability.
<p></p>Some of you may remember the other line up I tried on a third friend,  but it didn't seem to persuade her (Bridle Gossip,  then Winter Wrap Up),  but it did seem to improve her attitude toward the show.  She admitted it was cute and I did plant the ear worm that is Winter Wrap Up.  Even if she doesn't ever watch it again,  I'm content knowing she's not apprehensive about it anymore.
<p></p>Currently working on a 4th friend too.  He's well aware of the brony community and I think his mind was kind of half blown when he saw me post my Winter Wrap Up Twilight on my site.  I keep telling him to try some episodes so he can see for himself,  but he hasn't given in yet,  hehe.  If he does though,  I'm thinking I'll probably try the Bridle Gossip,  then Winter Wrap Up line up on him,  unless he gives me a lot of episodes to work with.  Then I'll probably tack Ticket Master to the front and Sonic Rainboom to the end.

            Wow,  that video actually honestly scared me the first two or three times watching it. I literally jumped a little at the part where she said "come out". It was right in line with the scene and believable.
<p></p>Now it's finally in the realm of funny for me and is making me laugh. If only they left out that Pinkie Pie picture at the end. It would be pure gold.

I think it would have been pure gold if they had managed to superimpose the broken door frame over Fluttershy.

<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Regarding ponybeat earlier,  I still think that 'Luna [DREAM MODE]' is a great case of a fan-made original song being as good as the Danial Ingram one's. </div>
Yeah,  that may be true,  though I think it does have some similarity to "We Are The Cutie Mark Crusaders",  but maybe that's just from hearing both of them in a row.  Does anyone know what differences there are between "DREAM MODE" and "NIGHTMARE MODE" besides the death growl bit at the end?
