<p></p><em>*</em>ahem*.  Let's see here... I skipped the last twelve pages because I just got back here,  but... let's see.  I actually have compiled a timeline of the first season,  or rather,  what it's possible to timeline of the first season.  There haven't been many continuity nods to the first season in season two just yet,  but once the season is over,  I'll go back and see where (if anywhere) the new episodes fit in.
<p></p>One thing I can say for certain is that most,  if not all,  of season two occurs after "Lesson Zero",  and almost all of season one takes place before it.

        <div class="post-content">
            Arg you guys post fast.  Okay,  let me try to sum up:
<p></p>@Rarity getting the gem from Spike: I think the issue here is that the animator and actors/writers didn't seem to be on the same page.  I forget who pointed this out earlier in the thread,  but if you listen to the way she's talking without looking at the animation,  it sounds like she's just fawning over the ruby,  and she's surprised when Spike gives to to her.  It's mainly the body language that makes it looks like she's trying to charm it away from him.  I don't think that's what the writers were going for.
<p></p>The other thing is that even in that case,  her reaction isn't entirely unmerited.  First of all,  she has no idea what Spike had to go through to get the ruby or that he was saving it; for all she knows he just found it someplace.  And keep in mind exactly how much these sorts of things would mean for her and how she would feel about it getting wasted.  Thing about something you want really really badly,  like a 3DS or an iPad or something like that.  Now imagine that your neighbor got one of these things,  and has expressed his intent to shoot it out of a cannon,  or do something else with it that will result in the thing being totally destroyed after one use.  Even if it isn't hers,  I can sympathize with her in that she doesn't want something extremely valuable to be destroyed.
<p></p>Yeah,  Rarity does come across a bit as trying to seduce it out of him,  but I don't think that was the show's intent.
<p></p>@taking Spike to the Doctor and Vet: Really,  it actually makes sense for the doctor to recommend to take Spike to the vet; he's an expert on ponies,  and Spike isn't a pony.  And the pony version of a veterinarian isn't so much "animal doctor" in Equestria; there are other sapient non-pony animals,  so it sort of makes sense that they'd have a separate doctor for them.  Also,  Fluttershy is probably the primary animal caretaker,  while the vet is the specialist; she takes care of the stuff that Fluttershy isn't knowledgeable about.
<p></p>@Spike's position in pony society: I'm really starting to get a bit sick of the "Spike is a slave/child labor/whatever" stuff.  He's clearly treated as being one of the group in this episode; Twilight seems to see him as more of a little brother than anything else.  As for his work,  he never seems to get worked that hard; most of what he does is either transcribing for Twilight or looking up books for her,  neither of which is all that strenuous.  He's also getting room and board,  and likely a top-notch education out of it as well.  Not to mention that he seems to have plenty of time for himself.
<p></p>@Timeline: Not touching that with a ten-foot pole
<p></p>@Gilda: I just didn't find her as entertaining as most of the other antagonists; Blueblood and Trixie were just so over-the-top and hammy that they were more fun to watch.  Gilda was almost too realistic of a jerk; I've actually known people who acted like that,  so she seemed way less sympathetic.

            @Jteeth: Most of the ponies clearly see Spike as a person. Twi was too young to really develop motherly instincts over Spike,  and now that he's mentally mature enough,  she thinks of him more as a brother,  although no doubt there's a tiny hint of motherliness in her interactions with him.

            This latest episode is one of my favourite MLP:FIM episodes yet,  but even within it,  <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FnR0zFCRUs#t=19m52s">this scene<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is probably my favourite... them confirming that Rarity knew how Spike felt about her had a "wow,  they actually went there" feel to it,  and they way they handled it was <em>adorable.</em> The way it comes together just feels so overwhelming.
<p></p>I'm tempted to consider it a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>,  but I'm not sure if that's the right phrase.
<p></p>And as I said on youtube...
<p></p><hr>
<p></p><em>This episode is a permanent game-changer for the series.</em>
<p></p><em>In having Rarity make clear both to Spike and to the audience that she knows about Spike's feelings for her,  this episode has slammed the﻿ door on plots that would require Spike to think she doesn't know... but has also opened﻿ another door,  to plots that﻿ would require this to be no secret to Spike OR Rarity.</em>
<p></p><em>What a brave new approach that has such writers take it.</em>

I certainly didn't expect them to shake the status quo as much as they did.
<p></p>... OR this ep could take place canonically at the END of the series. Freeing the writers up to write as many "Rarity doesn't knw about Spike's affections" gags as they want

You don't think having Spike now know that Rarity knows how he feels is going to make a major difference?

            S2E10 is new best episode.
<p></p>I doubt she knew about it during "A Dog And Pony Show",  for instance.  A lot of their interactions up until now seemed to be Rarity looking for someone to give her a hand with something and Spike eagerly volunteering.  I'd have to rewatch the scene,  but I imagine she figured it out - I mean really figured it out,  not just subconsciously getting the feeling that Spike liked her - right after Spike turned back to normal.  I mean,  she had to make the connections - Spike took <em>her</em>,  and he turned back to normal after he saw the fire ruby.

            That's what I think as well; she probably just thinks that Spike is really helpful until she catches on due to the whole "triggering his switch back to his old self" thing.
