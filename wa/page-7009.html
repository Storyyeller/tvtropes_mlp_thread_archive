            well maybe if a gym "teacher" would actaully TEACH something instead of just screaming and yelling,  and thinking just telling you to run would do shit.
<p></p>I learned more about fitness on my own in a week then 12 years of Gym "teachers" AND four years of MILITARY "Fitness instructors" ever taught me.

            @Bad That fic almost had me thinking they the author had stolen my story. It's also called "Make a Wish",  and the tags and characters involved are nearly identical. Not to mention that it had also been up on EQD a few weeks ago. It looks to be entirely coincidental,  as the premise past the characters in completely different. Still kinda creepy,  though.

            Exactly Applelight,  that's just the thing.  Now the best way to do this is to impose the task when they are exiled.  The stipulation of their return being that they must demonstrate they have developed those areas they had previously lacked,  be it compassion,  truthfulness,  generosity,  or whatever it might be.

<p></p>Yes,  that is a brilliant idea.

            I tend to believe anything negative dealing with 'Shy's childhood trauma is conflated to extremes when she remembers it due in large part to her neuroses.

I think exile would be preserved for the worst of the worst.  For example is someone's inconsiderateness caused another pony to lose their job or ruined them financially which led them to taking their own life.

            Party of one is one of my FAVORITE episodes. It completely rounds out pinkies character from a flat -happy all the time- character to a more neurotic but well loved character.
<p></p>Also I vote for Bridle Gossip.

<p></p>Big Family Day or something.  Episode when all close family (parents,  siblings or some cousins) meet or at least family of Mane Cast,   that way we could learn about rest,  and they could speak and intereact. It would be adventure or slice of life or maybe even epic two parter.
