            Yeah,  any of "X you won't believe aren't photoshopped" things are usually really interesting.
<p></p>Also,  I'm no fan of Dragon Quest either,  but I'm not sure what the issue is with Peewee in particular.

            Peewee was <em>homeless</em>.  His parents were heavily implied to have been <em>killed and eaten</em>.  He literally had nowhere else to go,  so Spike took him in.  Are we <em>honestly</em> expected to believe that Spike would just give him up so easily after everything he did to save his life?

            @Bluespade: That's the issue I have with the new Quick Fixes (of which the pony article was one).
<p></p>They can be written by almost anybody,  and as we know,  something accessible by anybody is placed firmly in the sweaty palms of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw">Sturgeon's Law</a>. The columnists have to be experienced before writing long pieces,  which is why the long-form articles tend to be much,  much better.

I don't really get why a lot of fans depict the dragons as high level monsters,  they were nasty thugs,  but very petty ineffectual ones.

            @Some Guy They tried to smash one phoenix nest and then were defeated rather easily,  and they never once tried to burn anything down. I'm not sure what episode you're remembering.
