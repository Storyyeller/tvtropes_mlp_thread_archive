And she probably knew more potent versions of those magic,  was more magically stronger,  and had the more expensive and hard-to-get regents (courtesy of being a personal protege of Celestia) necessary for enacting those spells. She probably healed offscreen,  and because of the more advanced versions,  she healed considerably faster (and suffered great pain as a consequence).

            In my fic,  I'm taking care of the healing spell dilemma by saying there are no healing spells.  There's non-invasive surgery spells,  and anti-biotic spells and the suchlike,  but no healing spells.
<p></p>I can't wait to have a sarcastic doctor say this line "Sure,  lets send massive amounts of pure magical energy coursing directly through her nervous system.  That won't kill her at all!"

            Not too much,  we discussed pony biology and maturity and it <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudWasRight" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudWasRight">somehow</a> segued into Rule 34 <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">. Also we've been talking about various things.
<p></p>I wonder what other seeds/plant matter humans eat that Equestrian Ponies can safely chow down on without ill effects. I know our crazy-hot chili peppers might be too much for even Pinkie since they may have Scoville ratings that make them look like mace or pepper spray,  and since Pinkie can eat chocolate it should be fine for them,  but other stuff? Potatoes,  durians,  peanuts,  cashew and pistachio nuts,  there's a lot we eat that I wonder whether Equestrian ponies can enjoy too.
<p></p>@Kuroi: Ah,  yes. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a>. I have a special dislike for more permanent methods of traumatizing folks,  although admittedly I am not above weaponizing earworms,  memes,  and creepypasta to mindgame my foes into surrendering.

            CDRW: That's probably one of the best ways to go about it.  I dealt with it in my own by making the recipient of the spell become extremely fatigued and therefore,  still incapacitated for a while (making it worthless in combat and still having heavy consequences even when one is safe).

            Could make it so that healing spells require the user to give up vitality to heal another. E.g. they could bolster another's immune system but that would heavily weaken their own,  they could fix a broken leg but that would make their own brittle etc.

            I think that pegasi flight might be powered by magic. Even adult pegasi wings are too small to let them fly. So yeah....magic.

            CDRW: Not familiar with that series.
<p></p>Ace: That is kind of how it works in my fic.  The pony in question had to fall asleep to cope with the rapid regeneration (so yes,  it wasn't instant).  I had it so going from critically wounded to fully healed was a 3 day affair (of straight up sleeping).
<p></p>Dalek: So maybe Scoots' affinity for peg magic is weaker than usual.  And yea,  wingspan would have to be stupidly big to allow flight.  I draw my pegs with much larger wings than in the show and I'm pretty sure that still wouldn't be large enough to let them fly.

<p></p>As far as the Cake babies go: Yeah,  I'm assuming that Pegasi flight is at least assisted by magic,  and since it's stated that babies have random magic fluctuations,  so that could explain the fighting.

            @Badwolfwho: No,  I'm a new member to this thread. I have been a troper for about one and half years though.
<p></p>@Light Phaser: Thanks! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin"> Both of our avatars are pictures of Classic Sonic so,  I can see where the similarity comes from.
<p></p>@Japanese Teeth: Yeah,  I can agree with that. Due to their inexperience of magic,  they can call out spells which require a huge amount of mana (or whatever the ponies use) by accident. Thus,  a burst of magic increases their wing strength enough to make them fly for a while. It's easier for pegasi though. I just wonder how the unicorn parents fare with the magic fluctuations - especially considering that magic is one of their main abilities...
<p></p>@The discussion of healing spells: Well,  I like to take a combination of the three. To clarify,  regeneration-enhancing-spells,  instant-healing spells,  and vitality-sacrificial spells (reverse-necromancy?). However,  the costs are quite different,  and that's not factoring in that I don't consider either of the three kinds of spells to have built-in anesthesia - that's a separate spell. So,  the quicker the healing (and the less experienced the pony is to injury),  the more the pain he or she will be in.
<p></p>In my opinion/(self-canon),  regeneration spells cost less than vitality sacrificing spells,  which cost less than instant-heal spells. And of course,  the regeneration spells are the least painful (need less painkillers),  and the instant-heal spells are the most painful (a <em>huge</em> burst of pain - need a lot more painkillers and such). However,  each requires a different discipline of magic to master. They have relations yes but,  several of the techniques are different.

            Yeah,  I'm leaning toward Scootaloo's wings simply being too small. They're strong enough to generate enough propulsion to propel her scooter or to hover,  but wings need a large cross-section to actually generate lift.

            @Delvarian: I think unicorn parents would probably fare a bit better than Pinkie did,  as they actually can <em>use</em> magic to counteract the weirdness that their kids pull.

            Welcome to the thread then. There's a little questionnaire we tend to give to new members,  so here you go.
<p></p>1.) Favourite Pony?
<p></p>2.) Favourite Episode?
<p></p>3.) What do you think of Pinkie?
<p></p>4.) Favourite Background Pony?
<p></p>5.) Would you hug the Great And Powerful Trixie?
<p></p>Also on the Vitality sacrificing spells I was thinking that it is possible to use another unwilling creature's life force to heal the wound/disease,  this would be more difficult to cast and of course illegal.

Actually,  that brings up another good point. Parents as the same pony species as their foals would probably fare off better than those that aren't. For example,  Earth Pony parents resisting the sudden influx of strength from their Earth Pony foals. Pegasi parents being able to fly after and catch their Pegasi foals if the latter were to gain the ability to fly (through an influx of magic). Unicorn parents being able to counteract almost any magic influxes that their Unicorn foals have.
