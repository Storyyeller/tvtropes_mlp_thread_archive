            Zynga shamelessly absorbs and copy other games,  and are marketing company more than a game company. Luckily,  the Hasbro-Zynga deal seems to be one way,  with Hasbro making toys and games based off of Zynga's IP,  not the other way around.

<p></p>Zynga.
<p></p>Zyyyyyyngaaaaaaaaa.
<p></p>Social games are basically the dark side of game design,  and Zynga are the ones who started it all. They aren't designed to be fun. They aren't designed to be clever,  or challenging,  or to give the player anything back. They're designed to <em>take</em>. Their games draw you in like a policewoman disguised as a prostitute,  luring you in with the subtle sway of their hips,  the tiniest bit of evidence that they're an expert in what they promise,  and then BAM! They slap on the cuffs and bitch,  you 'aint going anywhere. They've got you for the long haul,  sucking money out of you it by bit. They're designed to be addictive,  and not only to get <em>your</em> money,  but for you to get <em>other</em> people hooked in. They're incredibly insidious,  more devious and better at what they do then even gambling machines - and that's the worst part. They're <em>good</em>. They're astoundingly good! I have an <em>enormous</em> amount of respect for them on a professional level,  but morally they sicken me.

            Yeah,  but why is that a bad thing?  That's what casual gamers like.  They're simply providing the service their audience desires.

            The only interaction I have with Zynga nowadays is when my friends hit me up for requests on my wall. I just quickly do the thing,  then exit out. I just... got bored with them.
<p></p>And it really doesn't help matters that Zynga basically goads you into playing other games once you've started one by way of their goddamn cross-promotions. Happens with EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.
<p></p>... God,  this brings back unpleasant memories. I REALLY need a pick-me-up now.
<p></p>Help? ;____;

            Ginger,  this is what you have to understand when I talk about Zynga: I am a game designer. This is not an arbitrary title I have assigned myself. It is literally my job - my entire life. I am going to school for it. I do not intend to retire until I die.
<p></p>I <em>love</em> games,  and game design. Of all forms of media,  games have the most potential to reach people,  and really affect them on a deep level. Games can teach people,  show them things they never imagined. Games have extraordinary potential to affect people for the better.
<p></p>And then there's Zynga. The people behind Zynga take the core principles of game design - the principles that I want to use to help people and make them better - and twist them on their head. The basic talent behind game design is the ability to predict,  and manipulate your player. You <em>could</em> use it to create an emotional attachment that a player wouldn't otherwise experience,  thus broadening their horizons. you <em>could</em> use it to teach a player a new skill. Zynga uses it to <em>make people give them more money</em>. They're some of the best designers otu there - their games are <em>impeccably</em> designed. these people could do so much,  but they're using it to get rich.
<p></p>Zynga is a corruption of the art that I love. I cannot stand what they do. They literally offend and sicken me.

            It's not the fact that they're casual game makers. It's the fact that they are essentially reenacting the plot of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moneyball" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moneyball">Moneyball</a>,  except with the manipulation and of millions of people,  and pretty blatant theft of ideas from other social game developers. Every move they make is based off of hard statistics,  not any want to or desire to make a good game.
