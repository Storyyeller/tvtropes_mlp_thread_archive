            @latenight: well technically most of them are but they are also surprisingly well read like a couplet or stanza but this is due more to the fact that quite a few modern poets have copied parts of Rumi's style and also that the translator,  Coleman Barks,  has given Rumi a distinct modern treatment that most people (myself included) like while some nit-picking purist have criticized. I've seen multiple translations of Rumi and honestly they aren't <em>that</em> different. As to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLordOfTheRings" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a>,  I'm not that deterred as I am also making my way through <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JamesJoyce" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JamesJoyce">James Joyce</a> 's <em>Ulysses</em> which I currently can't read because I need to find a specific annotated guide (I think it was Harold Bloom who I had before) to finish it. Very good book,  but too <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Joycean</a> to read on without help,  though this wasn't the case with <em>A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man</em>

            Hey Mousa! Not sure if you saw my critique the first time you asked for it,  so here it is again.
<p></p>@Mousa,  RE: art of the list: Hm.... <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryingToFindANiceWayToRipThisApart" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryingToFindANiceWayToRipThisApart">Hm...</a>
<p></p>Well,  first of all you sound a bit too close to the microphone. Like,  your voice sounds really fuzzy and just kinda off... I'd say either turn down your mic reception or back away from it. Your volume will be lower,  and you'll get a much clearer sound.
<p></p>As far as the singing itself,  it's alright,  though you're a bit clutzy and it's usually fairly clear when you pause for breath. But I don't imagine you do much singing,  so it's forgivable. Your voice itself <em>sounds</em> nice,  but it's hampered by the issues with delivery
<p></p>The lyrics are pretty good(I think; the muffled delivery makes it hard to make out a bit,  as does poor enunciation in some spots),  and certainly fit Twilight's character. I could imagine a bit of animation actually going along with it,  which I imagine was probably the intention. Thing is,  though,  while your general rhythm is there the lyrics stumble and force a few beats. Like,  I can hear you trying to stretch a single syllable across a beat where there should be two,  and occasionally you have a two-syllable word where it just sounds like there should be a word change. Things like that. I'd try comparing your lyrics side by side with the original,  saying them out loud and seeing how they feel next to each other. If it doesn't feel spot-on,  try reworking it.
<p></p>On the whole,  it's... alright. I've certainly heard worse,  but I wouldn't quite call it good. Passable,  yes. But not really exemplary in any way. Had it been something I'd stumbled across on Youtube,  I probably wouldn't have finished.
<p></p>TL;DR: Move away from your mic to get better voice reception,  work a bit on the lyrics to make them flow better,  and enunciate a bit better while you're singing. It's not terrible,  but it's not great.

<p></p>But I just got up three hours ago! It's only 3:22 A.M.!
<p></p>Long story short:  I never went to bed Tuesday night,  because I was working on a computer problem I had caused by clicking one button too many in the "Services" menu.  Then I had other things to do.  When I got home,  I just crashed.

            Oh.
<p></p>Well,  reception from 10 on has been reasonably positive. The only episode that wasn't fairly widely-liked here was MMDW,  I think. Some were liked more than others,  of course,  but the general consensus is that they've been good.
