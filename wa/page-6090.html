            Ah,  it looks like you get some of those more bizarre,  hey-plug-my-blog questions too,  Mousa.
<p></p>I've got one question that's basically "My name is pheonix and I'm a dragon and I work at sugar cube corner <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IveMAdeThisPartUp" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IveMAdeThisPartUp">and aren't I just super unique and special?</a>.

            I'm a fan of TNG and <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DS9" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DS9">DS 9</a>,  personally.  I could never get into Voyager,  I found Janeway insufferable.  The Original Series was also pretty entertaining,  especially the even numbered movies.

            Yeah,  I've heard that season three is when it gets good.  It isn't bad right now,  just rather meh,  so I haven't been progressing through it as quickly as I could be.

            Well,  you at least have the highlight of <em>Measure of a Man</em> pretty much the best episode of the first two seasons. That's pretty much the average quality of the later seasons right there.
<p></p>Oh and anyone that hated Janeway,  HAS to watch <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SFDebris" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SFDebris">SF Debris</a>,  it is just HILARIOUS.

            @Kegi,  you have several options,  you publish it with an OOC response,  publicly shaming the half-wit that had the half of a wit to post it and explain how it's not a real question and that the half-wit who sent it in is a -Sue,  or you ignore it and just say it disappeared into the ether. Or you just try be friendly,  respond with your characters interacting with the person asking the question.

            @ Drenius Hilrious internet reviewer,  he start with Voyager,  then the rest of Star Trek,  now he does damn near everything,  but always at least one Star Trek review a week. Some of them are quite thoughtful too. He's pretty much my favorite Internet Reviewer,  just cuase he can almost perfectly ppull off a deep thought ful discussion right along side really funny humor.
<p></p>And <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">his Janeway</a> has to be seen to be believed.
<p></p>Also it was his review of the pilot that got me interested in FIM.

            I'm planning on nuking my whole box as well,  sort of start fresh. But I know AHR would kill me if I didn't do her question.
<p></p>Which is why I'm delegating it to you Kegisak,  congratulations,  that's your question. Enjoy.

            Ah,  thanks I guess?
<p></p>What exactly is the question? Not sure I saw it in that little screencap there.
<p></p>As far as nuking goes,  there's still at least a few in there I do want to answer,  so no nuking is happening just yet. Although I might need to do some trimming soon,  I guess.
