            *resists urge to explain why the Madoka ending was actually pretty good for those involved,  especially given the overall tone of the series*
<p></p>As far as the elements of harmony go,  it is kind of surprising that they <em>never</em> appear in the series again.  I understand that they aren't something that gets pulled out on a regular basis,  but seriously,  everyone forgets they even exist after the 2nd episode.  You'd think they'd at least <em>mention</em> the things on occasion.
<p></p>It does make some sense that they'd never use them though; Twilight's seen what happened when her magic backfires,  so she might be wary about using it before the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a> hits.  There's also the fact that all six ponies have to be present to activate the thing,  which isn't the case for most events.  Not to mention that there have been very few enemies powerful enough to need the things; the dragons and Ursa Minor might have counted,  but it would have been overkill to use the elements in any other case.
<p></p>That and we don't know their exact function,  because we've only ever seen them used one time.

<p></p>I'd have liked a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> where the subplots set up a multi-parter <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>
<p></p>As for Madoka... it's an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndecisiveDeconstruction" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndecisiveDeconstruction">Indecisive Deconstruction</a>.

It has pointed out problems,  and then addressed them. But I don't see people trusting ferret-like sources of power with the immediate trust they used to have before. ／人◕‿‿◕人＼
<p></p>I also expect the motivations and character arcs of future magical girls to be explored much more in-depth. MLP has very good characterization,  but the setting is just too idealistic for any problems needing superpowers to actually be credible. Even with the giant-ass dragon,  we <em>knew</em> nothing really bad was going to happen. Same for when Rarity was kidnapped.
<p></p>Now if something seriously <em>dramatic</em> happened,  I'd be ready to take a magical girl plot seriously. Nothing on the level of Madoka Episode 4 (see what I did there?),  but something on the level of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackieChanAdventures" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackieChanAdventures">Jackie Chan Adventures</a> would be nice. <em>*slap*</em> "<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackieChanAdventures" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackieChanAdventures">YOU MUST FIGHT MAGIC WITH MAGIC</a>"

I think it was more an issue of Celestia choosing to banish her to the moon since she couldn't purify her,  not that moon banishment was their set function.
<p></p>Edit:  On the other hand,  I like the idea that not using all of the elements causes them do to weird things.  Using only one element causes your target to get something stuck between their teeth that no one will tell them about.  Two elements causes derp eyes.

            The way I see it,  it's a choice between forcing someone to go to their room to think about what they did,  and brainwashing them. Celestia preferred the former,  hoping her sister would change back in the time she was trapped up in the moon. As we all know,  it didn't work out that way. Whether or not Celestia knew this,  she thought it was better to take the chance.
<p></p>As an aside,  I have a theory that Celetia herself set the 1000 year limit,  but secretly. The other ponies at the time wanted Nightmare Moon locked up forever<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u> <div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> <sup>(cue Pinkie Pie)</sup> </div></span>,  so Celestia made it appear so. But she made up a prophecy about the stars aligning and made it look like Nightmare would escape all on her own. Otherwise,  the ponyfolk would be all up in arms,  and it would be chaos in the streets,  and all that nasty stuff.
<p></p>Anyway,  back to the present,  Nightmare Moon was eventually freed,  but still unchanged,  so Celestia really had no choice but to go for the brainwashing option. And it worked,  as far as we can tell. But for how long? Make someone believe something they don't really believe,  and you get someone who isn't really themselves. And there is introduced the chance of that person slipping back,  whether slowly or in one instantaneous moment of realization.
<p></p>Celestia (via Twilight Sparkle and company) managed to remove the symptoms,  but hadn't yet gotten to the heart of the problem: Luna's attitude towards her sister. And that's something that Celestia has to deal with on her own,  something no amount of magic can help with. She'll have to show Luna the error of her ways,  to borrow a tired old phrase. I can imagine it's something that'll take weeks,  if not months,  of sister-to-sister talks.

<p></p>That would be a fantastic analysis,  if it wasn't for the fact that something on the outside <strong>did</strong> taint her into becoming Nightmare Moon. She wasn't completely being controlled,  but her negative traits were definitely being amplified.
<p></p>I reckon Luna does still harbour a grudge against Celestia about the whole "night being unappreciated" issue,  but at the moment she's feeling FAR too guilty about what she did as Nightmare Moon to get angry

            @gingerninja: You have a point,  of course. But consider the prologue's choice of words.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">...but the bitterness in the young one's heart had transformed her into a wicked mare of darkness: Nightmare Moon</div>
<p></p>External influence or no,  Luna's attitude was certainly part of the cause. One could make the case that an outside factor gave Nightmare Moon her form,  and using the Elements expelled that form from her,  leaving Luna as simply Luna again. But that alone does nothing for the jealousy that remained in her heart,  and if Luna still feels that resentment after all those years,  who knows what new form of darkness might breed within? It would only be a matter of time before an alicorn,  still bitter,  plots against her sister once more.

It was clear that Luna missed her Sister deeply and felt really regretful for what she did. Maybe the bitternes in her heart was something she was willing to talk to Celestia about,  but this outside influence pushed her past that and into deciding to become Nightmare Moon,  or maybe it was a corrupting power which she willingly accepted unto herelf in a moment of bitter despair,  making the line still technically true
