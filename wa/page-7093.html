            Sorry I disappeared there,  I was showing my mom Nostalgia Critic's review of <em>Felix the Cat: the Movie</em>.
<p></p>I wonder,  what would happen if Pinkie Pie got her hands on Felix's magical bag of tricks?  Would she A) willingly return it because she's so nice,  B) give it to Twilight to study,  or C) figure out how to work it<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> canonically it only works for Felix for some reason</div></span> and thus cause the apocalypse?
<p></p>Episode voting:  Ya know what,  I'm gonna save myself the trouble of thinking and just keep voting for "Return of Harmony" until its no longer a choice... or until the contest ends,  whichever happens first.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">The issue may be that some people are just so used to being spoonfed everything relevant by the people who think Viewers Are Morons that it's hard for them to realize when that isn't in effect,  and where stuff not explaicitly presented can exist......which is a very VERY rare occurance anymore.
<p></p>as such,  we see only pony country,  there for only pony country exists. Have I mentioned how much I hate that crap? (the Viewers Are Morons,  spoonfeeding us stuff) and how much i LOVE this show for not doing that? </div>
<p></p>Oh gee thanks.  So because I don't like non-ponies in a pony show I'm "too used to being treated like a Moron."
<p></p>I,  the only guy on this forum who has read <em>Lord of the Rings</em> and <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em> in their entirety,  cover-to-cover,  who normally entertains himself by watching black-and-white film,  plays strategy games,  has beaten Battletoads,  was a straight-A student in high school,  and normally prefers anime to western animation for not being as dumbed-down,  am only displaying speciesist tendencies because I'm an idiot who can't figure out that "Equestria isn't the only country hur hur."
<p></p>Nevermind that's B.S. because we've never seen a single hint that there are other countries or that Equestria is actually a country and not a world.  Methinks people are getting fanon confused with canon.

            Actually,  on the note of the changelings:  in their "default" forms... they're still pony-like.  In their DEFAULT FORMS.

            @Moe: Like or not,  there are plenty of hints that countries outside Equestria exist,  and I really don't think it was ever implied very strongly ponies ruled the entire world.  You're working off the assumption that the setting of the show is all-pony when I really don't think there's any basis for that.  The show simply focuses on the country that happens to be populated by ponies.  I mean,  when Gilda shows up,  I'm pretty sure it if she was an oddity among griffons and there were no other sapient griffons,  that somepony would comment on it or something.  It's an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccamsRazor" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccamsRazor">Occam's Razor</a> thing; it's simpler to assume that there are non-pony nations that we just don't see.
<p></p>Really,  this entire argument comes down to the assumptions that we make about the show's premise: Does the focus on ponies imply that they're the only sapient species?  I really don't think it does,  but if somebody else assumes differently there really isn't much more we can say about it.

            I'd have to get a page count to know for sure,  but the longest book I've ever read is probably <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattlefieldEarth" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattlefieldEarth">Battlefield Earth</a>. It's actually pretty good,  IMO. You just have to get over the stigma from the movie and the fact that the book's author founded Scientology.
<p></p>Though,  I have this nice hardcover copy of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cryptonomicon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cryptonomicon">Cryptonomicon</a> that I got from my dad sitting on my shelf that would beat that if I ever got around to reading it.
