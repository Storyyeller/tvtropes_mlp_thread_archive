            @Perpetual: I think the question is whether Scootaloo falls into that though.  If her intent is to <em>be</em> Rainbow Dash,  you'd think she'd spend a lot more time trying to get airborne.

            @JT I was responding to ATC saying that he wanted Scootaloo to grow up to be exactly like RD,  right down to the details in her life. We don't know quite enough about Scootaloo to know whether or not she's that obsessed,  though I doubt she is.

            There's definitely potential for an episode where Scoots tries basically be "Rainbow Dash 2: Son<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> yeah,  I know she'd technically be a daughter,  but then it doesn't sound as much like a B-Movie title</div></span>,  and eventually realizes that she can't do that and decides to change things up a bit.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Because as of yet,  the show hasn't really done major followups to previous episodes outside of the 2-parters.  I think they <em>could</em>,  and it would be great if they did (because frankly DQ didn't really do much for me; too much dragon shenanigans,  not enough character focus),  but given how the show usually goes I don't find it particularly likely.

            Yeah,  the entire thing pretty much boiled down to Spike going "I'm going to find out about what it means to be a dragon!",  and then deciding "wow,  dragons are dicks,  I'm going to be a pony".  I wish it would have focused more on his history and how he relates to the ponies.  We didn't really find out anything about dragon culture,  or how Spike ended up getting raised by ponies,  or how the ponies reacted to Spike being a dragon,  anything like that.

            @Blue: Basically my issue is that it spent too much time with the teenage dragons dicking around rather than actually answering any of the questions the episode brought up.  When it started,  I was expecting to find out stuff about what dragons were like,  and how Spike ended up living with ponies,  and generally actually figure out what being a dragon means.  When it turned out that all we really learned was "dragons kinda suck" I thought it was kind of a letdown.  It didn't really tell me anything else about Spike's dragon/pony interaction and cultural differences outside that Spike identifies as a pony because dragons are jerks.

            I would have liked to have known why the dragons were gathering for one thing.  I can guess why but some explanation for why a generally solitary race would gather together and migrate together would have been nice.
<p></p>I would have liked for Spike to meet his mother or father,  or at least seen someone that might have been either of those.  Or even a mention of So and so who died and nobody knows what happened to their nest...
<p></p>I dunno it had all this promise of giving a peek into why Spike was where he was and all we found out is that Dragon teenagers are .... teenagers.

She decides that,  even though Gilda was the one in the wrong at the time,  try to reconcile with her.  The moral being that even if your friends are awful sometimes,  maybe you should actually try to help them become a better person rather than cut all ties with them.</span>

            @Turtle Well,  for just about any sort of animal that is normally solitary,  but migrates in groups,  the reason is almost always mating. That seems like a likely explanation to me.
