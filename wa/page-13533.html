            Fanon is all fine and dandy when there's a basis for it,  but there really isn't for Dinky. People just decided that they were a family based off of similar coloration. It's the same as how Minuette is apparently a dentist because her mane looks like toothpaste. I'm just left wondering why people have issues with accepting fanon stemming from actual evidence,  when they refuse to let go of stuff with zero evidence.

            @Perpetual:  With Dinky,  its largely momentum.  She's been Derpy's daughter in the fandom's eyes for so long at this point,  it will pretty much take the show outright stating otherwise to change it.  There's also the fact that it's completely adorable.  The Derpy and Dinky stuff has led to some of my absolute favorite art/fanfic regarding background ponies.

            @Perpetual: Yeah,  I don't get that kind of stuff either. I mean,  it's a cute idea and all,  but that's really all it has going for it,  especially because it's been repeatedly demonstrated that members of families don't necessarily share similar coloration.  Granted,  I <em>like</em> the Derpy and Dinky fanon because it's freaking adorable,  but if the show disproves it there's really nothing to do but move on.

            I'd also suggest that the idea of Dinky being Derpy's daughter is a lot more interesting than her being Carrot Top and Written Script's.  With the latter,  its just a standard family set up that isn't all that different than any other.  With the former,  you have a single mother who is doing her best to raise her daughter,  and depending on what fanon you're going with,  she's doing it in spite of a disability.  I also like the fact that the fandom has taken a silly wall eyed pegusus and turned her into a caring mother.  It would have been a lot easier to just turn her into a constant joke.

            SO does Dinky actually have a personality? Other than being Derpy's cute child,  what's her shtick? And from what I've heard/read/deduced from her personality which admittedly isn't that much,  wouldn't her childlike outlook clash with Dinky already being a child? There's got to be some way to balance that out.

            So,  yeah. You need any further proof Hasbro won't fuck with...if they are smart anyway... the overall show formula? Or do something to end it or ruin it?
<p></p>They must REALLY love MLP right now. Turns out,  overall profit for hasbro was down 6% last year. BUT
<p></p><em><a class="urllink" href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1171181-hasbro-is-sitting-on-a-potential-gold-mine?source=yahoo">However,  there has been a rather significant anomaly. In Hasbro's latest Analyst-Investor Day we learned that My Little Pony sales are up double digits globally. My Little Pony will be in 180 different countries in 2013. POS (point of sale) for My Little Pony is up 50% globally. In some international markets,  the POS was up triple digits! This strongly goes against the declining toy environment.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>

            @Crowfall: And this is exactly why I prefer The Derpy and Dinky {With Sparkler being optional} fanon over pretty much any other option. It's just alot more intreasting then any other random BG Pony family IMO.

She went trick or treating as a firefighter with Pipsqueak and the Cutie Mark Crusaders in "Luna Eclipsed". Pinkie pulled her and Scootaloo in first to join in jump roping during the "Smile Smile Smile" song. She's usually just kinda around other fillies being cute.
<p></p>In fanon she's usually just straight up nice,  sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears">Wise Beyond Their Years</a>,  sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">the Fourth Cutie Mark Crusader</a> (before Babs debuted anyways). She's definitely the most popular background filly,  if only because of the association with Derpy.
