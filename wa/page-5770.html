            I can't imagine what I'd do in an actual fight... probably run. Judo is fun,  as are most other martial arts,  but they're fun as a <em>sport</em>. Outside of that,  I'm an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Actual Pacifist</a>. It's <em>way</em> to easy for me to hurt people,  so I try to talk my way out of any unpleasant situations. Of course,  it helps to <em>look</em> like you would punch someone through a wall if it came to it. People listen much better.

            @Bad I normally get someone to the ground by using my body weight to FORCE them down.
<p></p>I'm too afraid to run... terrified they might chase after me.
<p></p>I'd probably kill someone in a real fight... for fear that they'll come back later

            Re: exercise
<p></p>I tend to favor long-distance walking. A byproduct of having nothing better to do after classes during high school,  and preferring to be on my own. Walking is a good way to be left alone,  and it helps me think about stuff (unless it's a mathy sort of thinking,  that needs a desk and a lot of paper and sitting down). So if I had to guess,  I'm probably built more for endurance than strength.

            I'd probably run from a fight just out fear of getting my ass kicked.  If I couldn't,  I'd go into straight of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatist</a> mode.  Target the eyes,  throat,  and junk,  throwing dirt in his eyes,  gouging,  whatever.  If somebody's trying to cause me actual harm and I can't get away I'm doing my best to kick their ass.  (Even if I'd probably lose)

            I'm the sort you didn't want to fight,  primarily because I felt the best way to deal with someone problematic was to kill them.
