            My best guess is that Luna's physical growth was halted while she was sealed.  Whether that's because she was sealed or because she was Nightmare Moon at the time,  I can't say.
<p></p>Doesn't the opening narration refer to Luna as 'the younger sister'?
<p></p>^Well,  the connections are interesting,  but the cards themselves were just screencaps,  for the most part... they looked good,  but they weren't much to comment on.

            Roboshi occasionally comments and also has a tumblr. Apparently,  he favourites more often since people started noting how much he faves.
<p></p>His ponysona's special talent is liking things.
<p></p>EDIT: I believe that Luna's growth <em>did</em> halt while she was on the moon,  but that Celestia is still hundreds of years older than her. Only case I've seen of an exact number is 600 years in the fanfi Order and Chaos (which is pretty good so far).

<p></p>As for Celestia and Luna,  I'm not quite sure how much difference is based solely on age and how much is just Celestia being more mature.  I do think she's a good bit older,  but still.
<p></p>Also,  I know nothing about programming.

            They have interesting motifs and all that,  and are used in a form of fortune-telling. I just thought it'd be interesting to make a few from this show and see how they looked,  and try to match the character to the card's meanings. Though I don't know if I'd be able to fill all 22 of the ones in the Major Arcana. I do know that Fluttershy would be Strength,  among other things,  but that's as far as I got. I don't think I'm gonna do many more.

            I made a few pony-based Tarot cards,  and there's been some discussion on relative ages of the princesses.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> I didn't make those ones. I just realized how perfect Discord was for The Devil (and not just because of his appearence),  and did a few others. I haven't actually <em>made</em> a Fluttershy-as-Strength. I just know it would probably involve her dealing with either the manticore or Cerberus.
<p></p>As for those two: The Lovers would be the Cakes,  or perhaps Cadence and Shining Armor,  if all goes well in the end with them. Death represents great change and stuff. I don't know who r what would represent that.
