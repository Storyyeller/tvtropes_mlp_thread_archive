            Honestly Mousa? This is going to sound probably really insensitive,  but I think you're lucky that you didn't find out about it until now. In a lot of ways I think people go about treating people with various disorders wrong; trying to medicate them and playing to the disorders. I think that the best way to deal with them is to simple push through them.
<p></p>My brother has ADD,  and he takes Ritalin <em>occasionally</em>,  but for the most part he learned to concentrate by simply being forced to sit down and concentrate by my parents. So yeah,  I think you have the benefit of being forced to find ways around them on your own,  rather than just medicating them and then becoming dependent on the meds(Well,  I don't think there's medication for Aspergers or Executive dysfunction,  but you get my drift).
<p></p>Also,  Ginger: I really don't care for 20th century cure. I much prefer any of Nathan's songs,  or Rotti Largo's villain song in that movie. Zydrate anatomy,  too,  just because I like how the druggies chime in after every line,  and how Gravedigger sings it like a sales pitch.

            The thing is that I never did learn and my lack of coping ask ills was what drive me into he depression that made me drop out of UKY after the first semester that started this mess. I got through high school because high school was easy,  not by learning anything. I am without the tools to cope with anything and the doc said she was surprised that combine all that with the bullying how I hadn't been suicidal.
<p></p>@Ace and <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JTeeth" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JTeeth">J Teeth</a>,  yer both quite right and I'm sure things can only get better from here now that I know exactly what my issues are.
<p></p>Though apperently I'm so high functioning no teacher or counselor could see it for eight years,  even during my darkest and most violent days.
<p></p>I'm a freak among freaks.
<p></p>And here's a fun tidbit I learned from the tester,  she's met another aspire who's obsession is MLP FIM. That cracked me up.

<p></p>Yeah,  now that you know what your issues are,  you can work to develop the tools needed to cope with them.  Think of today as a bright new beginning,  not a dark end.  And also,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SincerityMode" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SincerityMode">I am so pleased to hear that the s word has never even entered your mind</a>.  Please let it stay that way forever.
<p></p>Also,  so high functioning it's not been noticed?  Well,  that's a start! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">

            Cheer up,  Mousa. I got more or less the same problem right here. My autism wasn't diagnosed before my 20th either,  but I got the whole package of bullying,  terrible coping and other zany stuff that came with the deviation.
<p></p>It sucks,  but what yah gonna do? You live with it,  that's what. It's all a matter of finding your place and work from there.
<p></p>Life's been hard for me these past few months,  but things are looking up. My labour program that I could start thanks to my diagnosis hasn't even started yet,  but they already managed to get me an job interview for a pretty sweet gig. Besides that,  I discovered that I have a minor talent for creative writing,  so I can use my free time in a more productive manner besides sitting around the internet all the time.
<p></p>What I'm saying is: one door closes,  two others open. If you play your cards right,  life will have plenty good stuff for you in store.
