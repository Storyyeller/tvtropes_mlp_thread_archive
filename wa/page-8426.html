Even so,  you shouldnt tell us not to mention it. A number of us like the series. I don't tend to like a lot of the anime or other shows you all talk about,  but I just ignore the conversation when they come up. <br> <br>And yeah,  they're pretty much all jerks.

            @Ginger: Well,  okay. Not all of them are jerks though. Remilia's definitely a brat,  Yuyuko and Yukari can have that "insufferably smug" thing going on,  and Reimu can be pretty insensitive at times,  but Nitori is adorably shy,  Shou is devoutly religious and behaves herself,  the Aki Sisters just want more love for what they do in the Autumn,  and Kogasa just wants to feed on your surprise/fears.
<p></p>@swas: Not all of them :V Yamame's a good spider who won't abuse her powers on you unless you really really ask for it.

            They're not all bad. Maybe I just choose to like their positives,  but Mokou saves people from dying while lost in the Bamboo Forest Maze,  Byakuren and her crew are devoutly religious and work towards peace between humans and Youkai,  Kanako and Suwako are just doing their jobs as <em>Kami</em> (and they're really nice about being with their believers too!),  and even <em>Reimu</em> of all people helped to cool down the centuries/millenium-long feud between the Fujiwara clan and Kaguya,  and she clearly treats everyone equally whether they're a god bent on religious conquest of Gensokyo or a pranking fairy or that punkass klepto magician who freeloads on her tea and snack cake supply.
<p></p>Also Hong Meiling is best public face of the Scarlet Mansion :D
<p></p>@Romantic: Not quite,  Gensokyo is a safe haven for fantastic folk to live in this modern age,  where they harmlessly prank and scare people in order to uphold the old law of nature that youkai are supposed to attack people.

They're (mostly) all very powerful,  though. Like Ace said,  a lot are actually kind of nice.

            @Ace but he's right to hate me.
<p></p>My overall demeanour just grates on him more than anyone else.
<p></p>He doesn't break any rules,  he's just VERY cold to me

<p></p>You know what really gets under those kinds of people's skin,  Ginger? Being incredibly nice to them,  as if they were having a pleasant conversation with you. If you can't manage that ignoring them outright also works. It looks like other people in that thread were willing to back you up. No reason to let one guy get to you.

<p></p>I see we had someone who dosn't really see the magic of FIM?  That's interesting.  I actually like meeting people who don't like the show but express their opinions in an intelligent manner.  It's enlightening.
<p></p>Anyway,  I like this show for the same reasons others have mentioned.
<p></p>So,  what's up?
