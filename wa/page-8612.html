<p></p>Really,  keeping her consistent isn't the problem.
<p></p>The problem is,  having to do improv,  I feel like she's becoming a one-trick horse (no pun intended).  Seems like every time I whip her out,  all that happens is the humans-as-pets thing comes up.
<p></p>My original idea for Surprise was to have her be just <em>completely</em> out of left field.  She lived up to her name,  and just never said or did what you expect.  The very first story I wrote that featured her introduced her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by first introducing us to a human girl named Rose who worked for evil pony-hating humans.  Rose was scary and antagonistic and spent an entire chapter acting like she was gonna kill the mane six.  Then she helped them escape... and at the end,  rips off her skin to reveal she's Surprise in a human suit.  And before you have time to even figure out how that <em>works</em> they sped through town in a stolen van at top speed,  ramping damn near everything and singing the soundtrack to <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyTaxi" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyTaxi">Crazy Taxi</a></em></span>.
<p></p>I feel like I've lost a little bit of that initial wildness.  Even in my newer "Surprise Days" fanfics,  she seems somehow toned down,  and not near as completely-out-of-left-field as she should be.  Then again,  she was barely even <em>in</em> chapter three,  so...
<p></p>Okay,  I'll stop whining about my writer's block now.
