            How about you like it for it's merits and not it's effects? Separate the episode from the fanbase? Seems like a rational concept.

            Actually I could see Discord making a scheme like that,  he already took away the mane cast's defining elements,  taking away cutie marks doesn't seem that far from his capabilities should he ever come back.
<p></p>Granted this was played with a little in previous episodes,  in Bridle Gossip Twilight got her magic taken away while RD and AJ lost their powers in a sense for example.
<p></p>I admit I liked Luna Eclipsed. I liked they actually gave Luna a very unique quirky personality,  rather than just thriving on her Woobie status.

            On the topic of baking,  while Pinkie's not <em>bad</em> at it,  she's certainly not as good as Applejack at it. She refers to AJ as "the best" in Applebuck Season,  and AJ is put in charge of baking for the wedding.
