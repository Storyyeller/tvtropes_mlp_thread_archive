            i'm actually not all that worried about finding the right girl just yet. i just keep living according to what i know to be true and follow the dream given to me. if i find that special one along the way,  great. if i stay single,  that's fine too.

            Yeah,  looking for female companionship is honestly pretty low on my priority list at the moment. Having a girlfriend would be great and all,  but I'm so busy now I honestly have no idea where I'd find the time.  It hasn't been since high school that I actually gave the matter any serious consideration.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            Seriously,  I feel like too many people put way too much emphasis on just being in a relationship without enough respect to finding the right person. I don't want to get bogged down in a romantic relationship with someone unless we're really both into it; I wouldn't hook up with some random person just for the sake of saying I have a girlfriend.
<p></p>And now to get back on topic those ponified Pokemon are awesome.

            In my (Extremely,  incredibly limited and honestly probably kinda messed up) experience,  the best route as far as that goes seems to be to not care,  and let something show up on it's own.
<p></p>Being single isn't bad,  honestly. A bit of extra freedom is always nice,  and certainly makes things simpler.
<p></p>And since I'm ignoring efforts to move this thread back on track anyways,  I'm super excited because I'm getting new windows this weekend! This sounds like really minor and petty thing,  but the reason I'm excited is these windows will have screens,  which means I can open them at night without any bugses getting in,  which means <em>maybe I can cool my room the fuck down from 30 fucking Celsius!</em>
<p></p>And to bring it back around,  I find it kind of humorous to imagine Blueblood pretty much putting Rarity off relationships for a while. Like,  "Stallions? Fuuuuuuuuuuuck that noise. I've got a closetfull of DVD's,  a pound of chocolate,  and Mr. Shivers. All I need."

            I should amend what I had said.  It's not as if I'm desperate to be in a relationship,  I'm not really actively looking at the moment.  It's just difficult going through each day and finding yourself analyzing each and every interaction you have with someone,  trying to find some form of common ground and worrying about how you're coming across to them.  It's one reason I keep my mouth shut for the most part when I'm at work and yet another reason I tend to isolate myself even during my free time.

            I remember having a girlfriend,  and it seemed all right at first,  but it went south <em>fast</em>.  She was pushing for something I did <em>not</em> want any part of (which I won't explain),  and even after repeatedly telling her no,  she was still saying I wanted to.  I dare say I am kinda glad to have broken up with her...  (I don't think I'd want to talk of my ex much...)
<p></p>Anyways,  if you had to take the job of one pony of your choice,  who'd it be?  (I apologize,  but love life's <em>kinda</em> a touchy subject with me.)

            @NES: This is why I'm waiting for a good prospect.
<p></p>@Keg: I know that feel. I've been having difficulty with my air conditioner for the past week.  It <em>worked</em>,  but the pump that's supposed to clear out the condensation didn't work,  so if we ran it for too long it would make a puddle in the floor of our storeroom,  so we had to turn it off during the night. And it's been humid as <em>hell</em>.
<p></p>As for jobs,  I'd probably take either Twilight's or Pinkie's.  AJ and RD's are right out; I suck at manual labor.  Rarity's and Fluttershy's I <em>could</em> deal with if I had to,  but I probably wouldn't like it much.  The animals would drive me nuts and I'm not fashionable enough to mess with dresses and crap.  For Pinkie's,  I could probably learn how to bake fairly easily.  Twilight's would probably be the best fit,  though,  given I've done my fair share of academic work.

            I might be interested in Rarity's - I enjoy designing cloths,  althoug according to my mother I have no fashion sense so I dunno how well people would <em>like</em> my designs. I've never sewn before,  though,  so the technical aspect might be lacking... Sewing is one of those skills I really feel like I ought to pick up. Very useful.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> I'm so goddamn domestic</span>
<p></p>Twilight's would also be decent - I actually applied to work in a library before,  but didn't get it because an old librarian showed up again. Fluttershy's requires too specific a sort of knowledge,  I'm gonna agree about manual labour being right out at least for a full-time thing instead of just a one day dealie,  an as for Pinkie... I'd be completely whiped out by day's end.
