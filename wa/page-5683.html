            @David I thought Big Mac's outburst was really harsh,  considering how chill he is normally. It was nice though,  because it really helped to show how much of an outcast the CMC had become.

            One thing I've come to appreciate is the creative control the dev. team does. With the show's main audience being young girls,  that doesn't leave a whole lot of wiggle room for story or expansion (not without the dev team getting executive meddling involved). So,  whenever the dev team does something like expanding the Equestrian world,  develops characters,  or shouting out to the brony community. As such,  I've enjoyed every second of Trixie's name drop and Big Mac's lines in this episode.

            @Bluespade: True,  although this isn't exactly a "preparation for a pressing issue" like her other freakouts are.  This is more of a revenge thing,  which just feels weird coming from her.
<p></p>I don't think that Big Mac was all that out of line either; the Apples have always taken family seriously,  and given how Apple Bloom basically tossed them under a bus to get a good story I can see why he'd be upset. It's not like he booted her out of the family or anything.  It was more of a "after all the crap you put us through we want you to leave us alone".
<p></p>And yeah,  just to clarify,  my reaction to the general reaction was more "Uh,  guys,  aren't you overdoing it a bit" rather than "HOW COULD THEY BE SUCH HORRIBLE PONIES DOING THAT TO CHILDREN".  I think it's understandable,  just a bit more than was really needed.

            I still think that they should have published their final article as "we're sorry,  and also Diamond Tiara was blackmailing us into it with these embarrassing pictures"; it would have been more satisfying seeing DT's plan get turned against her.

It was only the last article that they tried to write that was under blackmail,  and It seems they DID tell on her about that,  but the article would have no reason for it. It was them owning up to there mistakes,  taking responsibility for it,  and apologizing,  it would have cheapened it to say "Oh and we only did it becuase DT made us"
