            I wonder if it's actually possible to <em>lose</em> a cutie mark.

<p></p>Let's make the assumption that it's possible. By what methods can this happen?

            Well,  I thought that maybe losing your... Uh,  your calling in life. For example,  let's assume that AJ - after x years of applebucking - decides to quit and yet again try her luck in Manehattan at being city pony. If she won't be able to Sweet Apple Acres for some reason <em>and</em> won't find her new realization,  maybe she'll grow bitter and... Well,  poof.
<p></p>Of course,  it's only a theory and is unlikely to be true though I was looking for something more "mystical" than your typical "transplant skin operation".

            I'm assuming it used the "Die monster,  you don't belong in this world [etc. etc.]" dialogue,  yeah? That was an infamous set of lines in Symphony of The Night. It ends with Dracula tossing the wine glass he was holding to the ground and beginning the fight.
<p></p>So,  since Discord happened to be sitting on an elaborate throne,  and explosively threw his <span class="strike">glass</span> chocolate to the ground before getting up,  it was perfect.

            ^^^I don't think that's what causes it.  We've said it several times,  but <em>your interests do not dictate your cutie mark any more than your cutie mark dictates your interests</em>.  One <em>reflects</em> the other,  but neither causes the other.  If you ask me,  they arise from the same thing.
<p></p>Thus,  I don't think anypony would come to hate their calling just over time or anything.  It would take something really traumatic,  like a horrible accident or something,  to change their perception of their calling from the outside.
<p></p>I'm pretty sure that Pinkie would still be having fun with people even if she didn't have balloons on her behind,  is what I'm saying.

            @ gingerninja 666: On it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In <em>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</em> when you play as Richter Belmont,  you encounter Dracula as the last boss. The cutscene before the fight - <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm">being overly melodramatic and hammy</a> - ends up with Dracula saying "What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets! But enough talk,  have at you!". The first part of this final set of sentences is followed by throwing a glass with wine/blood by Dracula which then <em>epicly</em> shatters on the floor.</span>
<p></p>Discord's win is that instead of shattering the glass,  he <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome">''drinks it'' and then throws out the content which then explodes.</a> Other parts of the video were rather random though,  if you ask me.

            Oh,  just to clarify (didn't want to edit): Cutie marks aren't 'assigned' to ponies to dictate their jobs or anything,  and the Crusaders show us prefectly well that settling for a job isn't the way to get one's mark either.  Getting a mark is equivalent to the thrill one gets when one realizes "this is it.  This is what I want to do for the rest of my life."  There's a reason I call them 'callings'.

            ^I really think that's a case-by-case thing - I would think that would depend on what the pony's calling is,  what their personality was,  and what it's changed to.  For instance,  I can see Pinkie's calling remaining the same even if her personality were to shift for the depressive - she'd continue trying to make others happy even if she herself wasn't.  (Even in "Party of One",  she focuses on making her prop friends happy rather than herself.)

            I'm <em>kinda</em> with Death on this one.  I imagine some people get callings like that; it just happens a <em>lot</em> more often in Equestria than it does here.
<p></p>(There is,  of course,  also the fact that it's a lot simpler to have characters who are satisfied with what they want to do in life and deal with it in a specific episode,  if at all,  if your series isn't about finding oneself and existential angst.)
