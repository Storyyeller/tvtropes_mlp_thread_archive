This isn't specifically directed at you,  but at the whole "AJ does little" thing in general. <br>Specifically talking about <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMMystery" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMMystery">MM Mystery</a> for a moment,  what role could she have possibly had in the episode? She wouldn't have taken a bite of the cake,  and Pinkie already had Twi helping her with the investigation. <br> <br>I would rather have them make episodes that utilize the characters best suited for the situation instead of just shoehorning them into it. That was the reason I was okay with the fact that Rarity wasn't in Luna Eclipsed. Adding her in would have cluttered the episode. Having AJ do something,  other than not eating the cake,  would have made <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMMystery" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMMystery">MM Mystery</a> feel cluttered,  especially with the three other bakers.  <br> <br>AJ went with them to the contest as a friend,  but had no reason to get directly involved with the story. People can complain about her not doing anything,  but they don't complain much about say,  Pinkie and Fluttershy being in Boast Busters,  but not doing anything. <br> <br>I don't know how much of that made sense,  but I felt like typing it out,  so yeah. <br> <br>@ginger. I'm sure AJ bakes enough or eats enough baked goods that she doesn't really care much.

That was the reason I was okay with the fact that Rarity wasn't in Luna Eclipsed. Adding her in would have cluttered the episode. Having AJ do something,  other than not eating the cake,  would have made MM Mystery feel cluttered,  especially with the three other bakers. </div>
<p></p>that's what I'm saying,  she might as well have not been there at all. We got to see her at the start transporting the cake,  which was already more screentime than she's had in some other episodes.
