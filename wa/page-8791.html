            I wish the kickstarter I was following would get funded.  Its little labels you stick to the neck of your guitar to help you remember where the different notes are.  They are made with a special adhesive so you can take em off and put em back on without damaging the finish.
<p></p>I cant link to the page from here but just do a search for Kynd Decals if you are interested.

            I havent seen them for guitar,  if you know where I can get some let me know
<p></p>The violin I had in school probably had them on it.. it still had the sticky residue on it from some kind of labels.
<p></p>I miss violin.. but when I moved out of the City into the suburbs they didnt teach string orchestra.

            I was going to say something about that kickstarter rant,  but then I realized I don't have an opinion on the content,  I just think the guy making it is a pretentious dick. Ah whatever. I've got writing to do and I've put it off long enough. See you guys later.

            That Kicktarter rant brings up a lot of good points. Unfortunately,  he misses the point that the people going in to the documentary are trying to show all of the good things that make up the <em>majority</em> of the fandom. When you educate people on how something really is,  you show them how it <em>really is</em>. The statistics behind the "clop" sector of the fanbase show that it is such a small,  insignificant sector of the fanbase at large that you would be defeating the purpose of a documentary in order to bring it up. Not to mention the fact that this documentary is <em>entirely</em> De Lancie's doing,  and not a "circle-jerk" for the fans by fans.
<p></p>He really does make good points,  though,  and at first glance the Bronycon documentary is a great example of what he's talking about. He just failed to put in the requisite research.
<p></p>@Ginger looking a few posts above you should solve your problem.

            @Librarian: I'd hardly call what happened in Vancouver a proper riot.
<p></p>But,  Canada has its fair share of disappointments,  to be certain. Residential schools spring readily to mind - look them up,  I don't want to think about them hard enough to explain them.
<p></p>But on the whole,  lately,  we're a very good country. Harper is a bit of a shithead,  but everyone knows it and he's on his way out. Though considering both of the other two parties have new leaders,  which is always rocky territory for us,  it's hard to say how soon...

            So,  I've been seeing you all talk about poltics,  bully's and other stuff. Someone let me know when your all done talking about deppressing things,  okay? I don't need to get involved in this kind of stuff.

            For those watching that rant,  please do watch the whole thing. He's not bashing bronies as a whole. He's just tired of the kind of fans that spout memes incessantly,  shit on people who don't like the show,  and generally act like spoiled hipsters while shouting at the media for "not understanding them". I really dislike those people too,  and he makes a lot of good points about things to avoid as a fandom. <em>Any</em> fandom.
<p></p>@L Mage What? I don't think that's true. I know for a fact that <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaraStrong" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaraStrong">Tara Strong</a> has dual citizenship in Canada/USA,  and that's just off the top of my head.

            @Lurker I'm actually terrified of coming across like that. Hence why I'm no good at reccomending things. I hate sounding like I'm being gushy or that I'm pushing the show on people

<p></p>People born in Canada can get citizen ship in other countries,  including dual citizen ship,  but if you want to <em>become</em> a citizen of Canada you have to renounce former citizenship in all other places.
