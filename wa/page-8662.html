            @Ginger Usually,  yes. Occasionally you'll get some assistance from a friendly AI in the form of soldiers or security drones,  but otherwise your only contact with the characters is through terminals.
<p></p>You'd like Durandal. He's a great villainous AI in the first game,  and manages to manipulate both sides of what is essentially a First Contact War to gain the resources necessary to begin a plot to ascend to godhood. He even beats out <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GLaDOS" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GLaDOS">GLaDOS</a> in my book in terms of AI villains.
<p></p>@Blissey I didn't dismiss Doom at all. Doom did it first,  and it was glorious. But Doom lacked a plot beyond "Demons are invading Mars. Shoot them." In addition to being every bit as good of a shooter as Doom,  Marathon has a real narrative.

<p></p>Or does it also stand for something else? Because I know it's really close to TCBY.

            Well,  of course I don't plan on reading it,  it doesn't have an intelligent villain and it's too focused on character development.
<p></p>It doesn't mean I don't consider it important to the thread. I rank it up there with the other really important fanfics that I will never read <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16"> (like <em>Dangerous Business</em> and <em>It Takes A Village</em>)

<p></p>And really ginger,  I didn't know that. It's not <em>as</em> big a thing,  since we've never,  you know,  discussed it like you guys have other fanfics,  but that's still kinda neat to know. Also Letter was <em>sort of</em> intelligent,  but that point could sort of be contested...

            Well that's fair enough; TCYB was never designed around having villains at all. they were more a means to an end; the story proper was more man vs. self. Well. Pony vs self.
<p></p>Writing intelligence is tricky,  because it's very easy to overextend yourself,  and that can lead to it being... bad. I don't think I'm quite good enough to pull it off just yet,  as much as people seem to like to laud me.
<p></p>Also,  nothing is unimportant if you assign it value. Things are inherently meaningless; value is decided by the meaning we give things. That,  interestingly,  was one of the major undercurrents of the fic. I turned <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotPersonal" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotPersonal">Its Not Personal</a> into arc words,  and explained at the end it meant that there was nobody in control,  and so we had to assign meaning ourselves. It was used to show that Blueblood's predicament wasn't given to him by the hand of god,  it was just a bad situation that he'd partyl drawn on himself,  and partly one that anybody could have. That made his development more related by showing that it was something that everyone could go through. It also made the events themselves easier to understand,  because he learned to give weight to his actions and the things that happened to him on his own,  therefore becoming a more complete person with a better appreciation for others and the world around him.
<p></p>I'm... sorto f an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiNihilist" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiNihilist">Anti Nihilist</a>. It comes through in my work sometimes.
