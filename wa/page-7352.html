            I'm certain they weaponized it to a degree; they're certainly the most warlike culture and I find it hard to believe that they wouldn't at least try to find a way to chuck lightning bolts around.

            More than likely. I mean,  Dash can technically use hypercompressed air as a weapon,  and Derpy uses lighting to destroy a building. Pegasi with more advanced 'magic' could theoretically pull off a lot of tricks... maybe even as high as naturally generating lightening. In one of the spinoff ideas I had for TCYB there was a pegasus warrior who could generate enough static electricity in her body to simulate a lighting strike when she hit an opponent. Though of course that's speculation,  there's no evidence a pegasus could become that powerful.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she was the daughter of a goddess anyways,  so bets are sort of off there</span>

            @Story Yeah,  but it would still be a waste of time at the moment. I really don't <em>want</em> to learn a new language in my free time,  especially when I don't have anything I could use it for. And PHP is perfectly functional,  anyway. I know you posted that article before with all of the things that are wrong with it,  but most of those really have no impact on the way I code. It's hardly any different than any other c-based language aside from a bit of syntax,  at least for what I've been doing.

<p></p>@ginger Thank you! Everyone else seems to brush it off,  but it intrigues me. It was RD's top move except for the Sonic Rainboom,  so it must be good.

            They have the capacity,  certainly. It can't be that easy to come by storm clouds,  so they may have the ability to 'make' them stormy. Plus within the context of the show they seem to create <em>all</em> the weather,  so there must be a process of generating static electricity.
<p></p>I imagine i'ts similar for unicorns. Most of them can't use 'combat' magic,  but the potential is always there. they just need to learn to properly weaponize it.

I mean all she's really doing is going fast,  it's not all that impressive from an athletic standpoint. Flashy,  but unimpressive.

            Some of the pegasi must be bright else who does all the calculations for the weather?  With all our computational power we can't model weather accurately.  So some of the pegasi in Cloudsdale must know a few things.

            @ginger The thing that made me think it was cool was the music from the scene where RD first pulls it off. The atmosphere for it was perfect. As a move,  it's not all that impressive though.

<p></p>@late Yeah,  but those would probably be the ones who understand the risks,  and would then be the least likely to use weather as a weapon.

            From a mathmatical perspective the rainboom is BUCKING AMAZING. She is going at least mach 6 and recently she did that going up AGAINST GRAVITY.

            Yeah,  the potential is definitely there,  and I'm sure that if they ever had the need to weaponize the weather they could figure out how to do it in short order if they don't already have it recorded someplace.  They might not use it often,  but there's probably <em>some</em> point in Equestrian history where it came up.
<p></p>The rainboom is impressive in the same sense that doing a thousand pushups in a row is impressive.  It doesn't take an incredible amount of finesse,  but somebody who trains themselves to the point of being able to do that clearly knows what they're doing.
