            @JT: Someone mentioned before that the test was supposed to be unwinnable and was meant to teach Twi how to accept failure,  only she actually bruteforced the egg hatching and never learnt to deal with failure.

            So I wasn't able to be at the synchtube but I was at the first one so my thoughts are: It was a decent opening,  definitely did a good job laying down the ground work,  there was a lot of highly cheesey content I couldn't help but facepalm at,  I questioned the logic of scaring them away with scary looking trees,  Rarity was annoying from the beginning,  I forgot how annoying Steven magnet was,  also his new mustache sucked,  I cannot see how he thought that unsymmetrical mess was lovely,  Rarity clearly has no taste.
<p></p>I found it odd that instead of Twi being shy or obsessed with studies she seemed adamantly obsessed with making sure she made no friends which just seems weird to me. Also I questioned the logic of the group calling themselves friends when that had barely been together long when they were about to enter the Everfree forest.
<p></p>Seeing this again made me wish that we had gotten the show of "Seeking Elements of harmony,  adventure,  Fighting Evil,  magical girls,  etc, " but I still love what we did get with the whole slice of life thing.
<p></p>Additionally you can see how much the animation quality has improved (Well at least you can J Teeth,  during the last synchtube I couldn't convince anyone that I noticed it.).

            In general I think it would have been a lot better if it had been longer.  It would have given the cast more time to build up something that was actually a real friendship rather than "bunch of ponies I've only known for a few hours".

            I almost think that 1 hour block episodes (Like doctor who or certain animes) would be better for ponies. It seems a lot of episodes have a really hurried plot.

            I mentioned this in the stream but someone on the staff must have really liked Lyra from the beginning.  She's already the go to pony for when you want someone bouncing around in the background.

            @Ace: I'm talking just about the pilot; it's kinda hard to say that the power of friendship saved the day when the ponies in question had only known each other for a day.  And during most of that day they didn't exactly get along awesomely.

            Nah,  it shows them bonding over life-threatening danger,  and then the rest of the season shows their newfound bond being tested. It also suggests the Elements themselves brought the girls together to make them friends.

<p></p>I noticed something. Chrysalis Cadance only showed her mean side when Twilight was near.  It make sense,   SA love for his little sister is probably only thing what can rival his love for Cadence,  plus TS was possessive of her brother (their parents probably not),  so Chrysalis  feel treated by her.

            I'm with Ace,  going through something like that forges a bond between ponies,  even if they didn't really know each ther that well,  they stillbonded and trusted each other,  plus ponies are just that open that it IS that easy from them to make freinds.
