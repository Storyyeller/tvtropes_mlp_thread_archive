            The name "Basil" still bothers me. Who in the fandom thought of that? It just seems like such a stupid name for a dragon.

            Equestria is a primarily pony-popululated province,  yes. Hell,  it was founded by a few firece fillies,  but I see no reason to assume that it goes as far as everyone else being little more than labor. I mean,  really? That seems pretty damn dark for this show.

            We've had this discussion of pony tech hundreds of pages back,  they clearly have a lot of tech that is post-1800s (microwaves are evolved from magnetrons which are derived from radar in the World Wars era,  the auto cider press is just an upscaled mechanical food processor like the little one Rarity has,  Dashie and Rarity refer to tanks and bullets,  and they have 20th-century camo gear even though the Royal Guards wear traditional plate),  but they tend to live comfy simple agrarian lifestyles because they obviously find it convenient enough for them.
<p></p>On top of that,  if we are to consider the show "consistent" with the old G1 flavor that the world is full of killer everythings that makes Australia look like the Garden of Eden,  then Equestria is just Dream Valley after the ponies really band together to manually carve a harmonious and peaceful world out of a hellhole where megafauna predators rule the jungles.

            Well,  I double checked a few scenes with the Rarity's kitchen and Sugarcube Corner's kitchen and couldn't find a microwave. Are you sure you aren't thinking of that one playset that had a microwave in the kitchen? I think that was pointed out some time ago as being strange.

<p></p>Oh,  well with regard to that stuff,  I feel like there's a fine line between what's "worldbuilding and expansion" and what is just throwing random stuff in.  26 episodes and a four-month wait are long enough for certain conventions to be established in the mind of a viewer.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I still don't see how Pinkie was OOC in A Friend In Deed. But enough talk,  I'm going to bed. </div>
<p></p>Pinkie wasn't "OOC" necessarily,  she was just blander than usual because the episode felt like it was trying to get away from the previous "she's annoying but you can't help but love her" vibe and replace it with more of a "look at her she's such a goody-four-shoes!" vibe.
<p></p>It's a fine point,  and you'd probably need some writing experience to really see it,  but it's like the difference between Twilight Sparkle and that book-lover from Strawberry Shortcake (I forget her name).

<p></p>She was being annoying to Doodle.  But ONLY to Doodle.
<p></p>Previously,  most people acted as if she was weird/annoying but tolerated her because hey she's harmless and even fun sometimes.  This episode?  She's literally friends with everybody and the entire town loves her unconditionally.

            No,  it was because Pinkie didn't know when to leave him alone. She only really became sympathetic in the end,  when she did something to try and make him happy; rather than doing it to befriend him,  or get him to accept her apology. That is,  she accepted that he didn't want to associate with her,  and that he couldn't forgive her for destroying his scrapbook. But she still wanted him to be happy.
<p></p>I like the episode because I think it's a good aspect for her character to have.
<p></p>The aspect of Laughter is not just an abounding happiness,  it's the desire to make others happy.

            The episode's from Pinkie's pov,  more or less,  of course she'd believe that everypony loves her. Also she's definitely a cheerbringer and welcome just for helping keep spirits up.

            There's a huge difference between being <em>known</em> by everyone,  and being <em>universally loved.</em>
<p></p>And while it could be just a perspective thing ("it looks that way because that's how she sees it" etc) the ep really does come off like its literally true.
