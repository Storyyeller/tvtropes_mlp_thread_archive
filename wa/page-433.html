            ^^ Battleship,  as in the game? I can't imagine that being successful at all. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise Driven</a> shows and movies I get. But unless they make a bunch of "you sunk my battleship" bumper stickers and s*** there is only ONE product that movie would make people want to buy. Unless the movie is full of Narm or incredibly well written to make it worth seeing,  there is no point to it.

            So,  there's this fan theory called the CMFIS (Cutie Mark Failure Insanity Syndrome),  which is a theory where when somepony fails at being able to use their special talent,  they go insane. Fluttershy's freakout was because she couldn't connect with the animals,  Pinkie's freakout was because she thought no one liked her parties,  Rarity's freakout was because her designs weren't appreciated,  etc). So,  if we're to assume this is cannon,  does this mean that Luna,  who felt like her role in the day-to-night thing wasn't being appreciated,  was sufferring from it in the first episodes?
<p></p>Furthermore,  it's been shown that whenever a character suffers from CMFIS,  their personality is reversed in some way (Twilight becomes panicked and disorganized,  Pinkie becomes irritable and rude,  Fluttershy becomes crazy and loud). If this is true as well,  does this mean that Luna's personality is the opposite of Nightmare Moon's?

            I think Twilight's panic attacks are part of her normal personality.  What I've come to notice is,  yes,  she is good at planning and tends to always have a plan.  But that's also the thing: she often has exactly one plan.  For whatever reason,  she tends to never have any contingencies.  This tends to lead to her panicking when things go wrong and,  once again,  she has no back-up plan.
<p></p>I would argue that assuming the theory (which I do personally agree with) is true,  the instant where she experienced her "personality reversal" would be when she finally went beyond the simple,  normal panic to realizing that despite her powerful magic,  there is absolutely nothing she could possibly do to fix the situation,  at which point she starts thinking completely illogically.
<p></p>I think the cutie mark failure theory fits really well in Luna's case,  as from what we've seen with the main six,  it could easily be the starting point of her rage and jealousy.  Given how vulnerable they all end up in those moments,  I could see that as the perfect time for whatever it is that helped corrupt Luna into Nightmare Moon to strike.

            <div class="quoteblock"> Furthermore,  it's been shown that whenever a character suffers from CMFIS,  their personality is reversed in some way (Twilight becomes panicked and disorganized,  Pinkie becomes irritable and rude,  Fluttershy becomes crazy and loud). </div>
And see,  this is why we don't really need to turn Princess Celestia into a supervillain.  Just invent some other supervillains who are able to <em>steal the sun</em> away from Equestria for good!  So at first Celestia's just gung-ho about the quest to get the sun back... But as the quest starts to look hopeless and her subjects start finding ways to get by without sunlight,  she gets all shouty and jumpy and starts to completely lose her wisdom,  her patience,  and finally her sense of humor in the face of this new crisis—but on the bright side,  she'll start appearing in the show all the time!

            I like the CMFIS theory - <em>but</em> let's keep in mind that Rarity's breakdown wasn't caused by the failure of her cutie mark. Her cutie mark and special talent are about finding gems,  which doesn't directly have anything to do with dressmaking.

That's actually the part I was referring to,  the "build an exact copy of Ponyville right over there" moment. Though I do notice that I probably had the general panicked part in mind when I was describing her freak out

I'm pretty sure the gem finding is just a part of her general "beauty and fashion" talent. Not all of the ponies talents have to be magical (like Applejack)
