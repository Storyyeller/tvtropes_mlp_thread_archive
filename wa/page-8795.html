            Turns out it was only <em>two</em> hours of Sviridov,  not three.
<p></p>And the director has me marked down as a baritone and not a bass. Well,  sure. Now I'm going to go for a swim before either returning to writing fanfiction,  watching <em>Empire Strikes Back, </em> or making fun of <em>Fallout Equestria.</em> Or I could continue in <em>American Gods</em> or <em>Les Miserables.</em> Or play video games.

            Dear Princess Celestia, 
<p></p>Sometimes the overanalysis can get a bit silly. Not all the time though. A lot of the time it's fun. But when it starts to diminish your enjoyment of the show,  then it starts to be a problem. Always remember that it's a show whose primary purpose is to entertain.

            @Blissey - I was a furry for quite some time,  about 15 years.  Back in the beginning the fandom was very small and Yiff was even smaller,  but once the Yiff stuff got out,  it was Yiff that was drawing people to the fandom and not the general appreciation of anthropomorphism.  I dont want to see the same thing happen to pony fandom.
<p></p>I think the fact that furry denied its existence,  it got sensationalized and was all anyone knew about the community.

            Guess I'm not swimming right now because I see conversation.
<p></p>I agree with Ginger to an extent. Too often it seems like romance and sex and stuff gets shoehorned into stories whether or not it's actually relevant.
<p></p>I mean,  a while ago I saw the American version of <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em> and the sex scene in it was quite frankly a crock of bullshit.

RPT is a problem that has ruined a number of promising fictional works...like <em>Star Wars Attack of the Clones</em>. Yeah,  Anakin Skywalker tries to charm Padme with lines about how she's more appealing than sand.

            It's all about demographic appeal. There are enough people who enjoy romance to justify its existence,  while most people who don't care for it tolerate it enough to not be turned away by it.

Back in the beginning the fandom was very small and Yiff was even smaller,  but once the Yiff stuff got out,  it was Yiff that was drawing people to the fandom and not the general appreciation of anthropomorphism. I dont want to see the same thing happen to pony fandom. </div>
<p></p>I understand where you're coming from. I'm just saying that I don't think ponies will ever grow quite big enough to snowball like that because its a much more narrow subject.

            Maybe Romance wouldn't bother me if it wasn't EVERYWHERE!!
<p></p>Same thing with vampires. I am SICK and tired of seeing vampires everywhere I turn.
<p></p>Now,  I'll come out and say that there are good vampire stories and there are probably good romance stories. The problem is that the oversaturation of these two things leads to me becoming tired of the very sight of them.
<p></p>It'd be like if I ate nothing but dollor store chocolate cake for every meal,  then every now and then someone gave me a gourmet chocolate cake made by the greatest chocolatier in Belgium. It may be the greatest chocolate cake ever made,  I wouldn't care because it's CHOCOLATE. I eat nothing but chocolate and I'm sick of the sight of it
