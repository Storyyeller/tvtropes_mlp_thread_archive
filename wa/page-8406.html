<p></p>So you didn't like Shaun of the dead? Or were you just insulting the awful Resident Evil movies?
<p></p>One of the funniest moments in my opinon from the original Dawn of the dead would have to be the short scene with the dumbass biker who thought it would be a good idea to check his blood pressure while zombies are ganging up on him. I think we all know how well those kind of situations end. Seriously,  talk about <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too dumb to live</a>.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            The Company that is doing the Adventure Time! Comic is doing it pretty well what Ive managed to get a hold of is pretty good (they sell out really fast at my local shop!)
<p></p>I'd really like a faithful adaptation Comic book and not some dumbed down one like the ones Ive seen translated from overseas.  They artist that does them is always drawing them off model too...

            @Chadaman: I'm playing Nier. There is a sidequest in which you have to grow two different kinds of hybrids in order to obtain a third hybrid's seeds out of sheer luck. I have to wait 18 hours every planting to check,  then another 18 for the plants to die and leave seeds. I've got 2 different save files for possible hybrid spawn patterns,  and the hybrid only has a 5% chance of showing up.

            @Chad - Im going to have to wait for them to come out in Trade Paperback form.  I barely managed to get issue 1 (It was 2nd reprint) and they havent had any of the other issues when Ive gone.  One of these days  I need to set up a box with them ... its sort of like a subscription service and you can go pick them up every month or so all at once instead of going to the store once a week to get whatever happens to be out then.

            @Chadaman: Ability customization only extends to attaching words to your abilities to modify their stats,  be it increasing item drops or increasing the amount of experience you earn. There are a LOT of words,  with an achievement/trophy only for getting 50% of them. You get them at random by killing enemies.

<p></p>@marston: Concerning the Archie Sonic comics,  they're a pretentious convoluted mess to me,  though they've gotten a <em>little</em> better in recent years due to more game-centric concepts and whimsical characterizations. Like pretty much every enterpretation of the franchise,  Eggman is a big redeeming aspect as well.
