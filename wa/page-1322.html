            Do what?
<p></p>This show drives me to become a fanfic writer!!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin"> It was also the first series to make me read fanfics at all,  with fallout equestria being my first and probably my current favorite. If anyones wondering,  my CMC adventures in......erm,  zebraland is coming along better than yesterday,  seeing as how I FINALLY decided on a concept for a villain that manages to satisfy everything I wanted enemies-wise in the story. Hooray,  no longer suffering from writers block. Now onto creating Zebraland!.......................*Writers block hits again* I just keep telling myself it will all be worth it once I actually manage to concept the dang thing.

            For a while I was planning a fanfic as well. Unfortunately,  whenever I started to write something,  it sounded a lot worse than it did in my head.
<p></p>I was also working on a GBA homebrew MLP Portal crossover,  but after a while I just lost motivation and got busy with other stuff. I still hope to complete it sometime though.

            The only kind of fanfic I'd want to write would be,  perhaps,  something detailing Luna's fall. I think it'd be an interesting story to tell,  now that we know more of her personality. Maybe even find a way to explain why Nightmare Moon spoke differently. Maybe something along the lines of "They do not <em>deserve</em> proper protocol. They showed me no respect when I spoke with them properly",  or something.

            @Kegisak: I actually did post a few chunks of it in there.  I might repost what I have so far.  It's more the fact that I have other stuff to work on that shoves that story down the priority list.

        <div class="post-content">
            A save-the-kingdom fic,  only staring the CMC instead of the mane 6. Why the CMC,  you ask? Not entirely sure why,  but I was browsing through the fics when I noticed the mane 6 have a TON of epic adventure fics,  but the CMC didn't seem to have any. This kinda bugged me.
<p></p>See,  in a show where there are a bunch of 'special' people,  like how the Mane 6 are elements of harmony and save the kingdom multiple times,  I occasionally find myself growing attached to the overshadowed side-characters,  and start thinking 'hey,  what would it be like if THESE people had to save the world instead?' and my mind gets-a-wondering. I don't always react like that,  especially if I don't like the supporting cast,  but I really like the CMC for reasons I don't quite understand,  and I felt kinda bad for them,  since most of them are family members of world saving heroes,  meaning they are probably just a little bit overshadowed. So I grew attached to the idea of watching them save the world for a change. Normally I would just hope someone else would do it,  but I've decided that for once I'd try and write a piece of fanfic for myself...............<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderStatement" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderStatement">Designing the thing is proving extremely mind-boggling</a>.
<p></p>It's gone through a LOT of concept changes (it originally had them taking a key from celestia's room that lead deep into the tower where Nightmare Moon had been at and discovering a basement that not even Celestia had known existed,  and it goes down down down into the earth for who knows how long. They wind up in another reality,  and can't go back until they find the alternate realities version of the keys,  which was going to be.....problematic. They find some helmets in the tower,  inherit some power from old heroes,  and go forth to questing).
<p></p>After that,  it changed around some more,  and then someone on youtube got me the idea that I could have the story take place in........Zebraland. (Does ANYONE got a name for the place I could use? &gt;.&lt;). I wound up liking this concept,  and have stuck with it since. I'm moving them out of equestria because that's kind of the mane 6's domain of saving; I wanted them to have room to grow on their own,  become their own legends.
<p></p>Now I just have to world-build up the place,  which is daunting but usually fun until I hit writers block,  where it becomes just plain stressful. I've only got a few things worked out as far as this goes,  I've barely gotten anything down. Except I've concepted what the zebra god-king would be like...................Hehehe,  he's quite the character.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue"> Boisterous doesn't even describe him; always hammy and jovial and all-around a really big guy in personality and physique,  constantly using phrases such as MAH BOI!!!!!!! and other such hammy phrases. He's inspired by <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MahouSenseiNegima" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MahouSenseiNegima">Jack Rakan</a>,  for any Negima fans out there. Don't think he's incompetant,  though,  cause his kingdom's opponents have thought that before. They were wrong. Very wrong. I've still gotta figure out what kinda role he plays,  though,  like how Celestia raised the sun; I'm not sure what he's supposed to do for the zebras. Besides partying.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue"> He has a younger brother,  who's more cool and laid back and the more smart-looking-ninja-like type. [[Strike: I wonder if he would make a good love interest for Luna. Little god sibling shipping yay!]] I've been flirting about with giving them a bigger brother who's evil and sealed away,  but I dunno yet. Oh,  and there's the blueblood expy.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue"> He's actually a mane antagonist,  that blueblood expy,  believe it or not. At least,  he's planned to be,  haven't actually thought much about that part yet,  I'm too busy with the rest.
<p></p>Zecorah is a mane character,  as well,  party member and mentor to the CMC. It will be interesting,  since she's barely been seen so far and she's suddenly in the spotlight.............I can already imagine the headaches that will come from trying to write her rhyming dialogue. *.* Oh,  I've designed another mane character in the meantime,  codenamed Drake. He's a human-sized dragon that walks around like spike. He's usually laid back,  but has a pretty much psycopathic urge to kill anything 100 feet tall or taller. That stems from the fact that when he was growing up (and he still is,  I suppose) his family of small dragons and him were constantly being told by the large dragons that they were feeble to them,  like gods to mortals. He was affected by this so much that he almost believes them even now,  and he feels the need to fight and defeat everything that's a dragon sized beast or bigger because it's the only way he can feel assured that they were wrong and that he's not feeble compared to the rest of his kind.......work in progress,  but I like him so far. Another reason he's there is,  quite frankly,  to make sure the CMC doesn't die off early in the story lol.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>The main villain and conflict is the thing that has given me THE ABSOLUTE WORST TROUBLE of the entire dang thing; I dunno what to do! &gt;.&lt; I've recently settled on him/her being an alchemist gone mad; this works because it explains where all the monsters in the story are coming from,  and because alchemy is something that seems natural to the Zebras. There are supposed to be at least 2 other bads,  who may or may not be fighting each other as well as the rest of the world. Progress,  blockage,  progress,  blockage....oh,  hey,  look,  cheese.
<p></p>I've thought a little as to just how I'm gonna level up my little ponies; it involves learing to 'fight like zebras'. See,  the Zebras in the fic have magic,  but not like unicorns; it's a little tough to explain since I'm still designing it,  but they believe every living creature has the ability to do magic,  evidenced by the 'passive magic' the non-unicorns do,  and it's all a matter of having a catalyst and drawing it out. Unicorns have their horns as the catalyst,  but the Zebras (most of them; there ARE unicorn zebras in mythology,  which I HAVE to put in because hey,  it's real-life mythology!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">) use other things as catalysts,  such as Zecora's alchemy,  and the more powerful of them use the classic symbols and runes as catalysts,  though that's only the most powerful,  the rest require something physical to imbue. I'm not entirely sure how to relate this back to the CMC yet,  though I do plan on having Scoot develop the ability to turn her wings into razor sharp weapons,  similar to the scene where Zoro from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnePiece" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnePiece">One Piece</a> learns how to cut through iron. She's quite easy to fit for combat,  that Scootaloo; she is skilled in bodily coordination,  making her perfect for being a speedster/bruiser that specializes in up-close combat and agility. The other 2 I have absolutely no idea what to do with,  though Sweetie will probably burst peoples heads open with singing at the right pitch or something,  I dunno. Lol I need to give them some trainers at some point.
<p></p>...........And that's it for the moment,  baring a few details I left out on the alchemist. It's gonna take me quite a long time to plan this all out,  since I have build an entire world and mythology behind the land and how an entire species works and.........yay. Ten cents says half of this will change by tommorow,  since I can't ever seem to stick with my current ideas.
<p></p>Wow,  that was longer than I thought. O.o It's actually a little encouraging,  since I'm floundering about at the moment; seeing that I actually generated a good few ideas already helps to reassure that I'm not going in COMPLETE circles ALL the time; only 90% of the time.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>EDIT: We have a thread just for this stuff? I love this fandom.

<p></p>Also,  if you're a <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Negima" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Negima">Negima!</a></em> fan,  you might be interested in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7063528/1/Caelum_Contortum_Snarled_Stories">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  which I totally forgot to mention before for some reason.  It's a primarily Negima/MLP crossover that's planned to start incorporating <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCrossover" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCrossover">more series</a> as it goes on.
<p></p>Also you might want to take that over to the pony fanfiction thread in New Media; the whole reason we made it was so that conversations like this wouldn't clog up the main thread.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
