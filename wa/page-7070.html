            I don't know I kind of enjoy going to the afternoon matinees. WHEN NOBODY IS AROUND. Also up there on entertaining is when I went to watch 9 and there was this chick who thought 9 was a cutesy animation featuring sackpeople. Her screams were delicious.

            @ Orion,  it's complicated. See the initial shows weren't actually recordings,  certain humans (and most other sentients,  including ponies) are able to subconscioulsy attune some of there brain waves to the quantum-vibrational attenuation of other dimensional branes. Not much,  but just enough that they get inspired and begin forming stories based on the small knowledge they obtain,  all with realizing it didn't all come just from them,  though most do add there own input (which is why there are some differences between the show we watch and the real Equestria)
<p></p>With you ponies though,  something happened,  so many humans fell in love with you,  and truly desired to meet all you,  and see the real Equestria that they began to bring more and more of us into alignment with your dimensions unique attenuation. how that works exactly,  I'm still not sure,  but while rare it isn't un-heard of. The part the makes this unprecedented is that somehow once the two became slightly more aligned you ponies were able to punch threw from your side as well. (personally I'm sure Pinkie had something to do with it)
<p></p>Though it's still not a complete bridge,  only allowing data to be sent either way,  not people or ponies,  but it's enough. Also please tell Lyra and Pinkie to stop trying and breaking through,  but between those two on your side and Seth on this one. you all are giving me a headache with all the potential really really bad things that can happen if you cause an improper breach in the dimensional brane.

            ..about that Steve......yeah,  not so much.
<p></p>Though even a TARDIS is a poor choice,  it's fine while staying within one space-time continuum,  and has limited ability with in that ones realted multi-verse (including requist sub,  and quasi deminsions) Trying to penetrate an entire demensional brane,  yeah that takes A LOT of fine tuning and effort,  and the results of ANYTHING going wrong...you ever seen an entire multi-verse turn itself inside out? ain't pretty)

            @ Orion,  basically a few humans had dreams about you ponies,  turned those dreams into stories about you to tell the rest of us,  and so many humans loved you so much it created the ability for you guys to see and talk to us.
