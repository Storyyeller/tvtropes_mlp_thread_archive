            The Yeerk can read the hosts memories,  so they must be able to read their thoughts as well. They must be able to talk back,  too,  since they can communicate in spite of their true form not having a mouth...

            Ah,  right. I guess my memories of some of the books are a blur.
<p></p>...man I wish I still had my collection of the books. I donated most of them to a kid my mom knew. I only really kept The Ellimist Chronicles and The Beginning.
<p></p>David: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He got trapped in rat form and abandoned on an island for his betrayal. In one late book,  he formed a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">pact with Crayak</a>,  who gave him his human form again,  and had him attempt to tempt Rachel to evil (or,  well,  to embrace her bloodlust,  basically). Rachel managed to overcome the temptation. And so,  at the end of the book,  David,  now in rat form again,  effectively begs Rachel to kill him instead of leaving him on the island again</span>. We never find out what she decided.
