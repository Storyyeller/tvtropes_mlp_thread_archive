            Rarity and AJ weren't doing anything besides grumbling about their distaste for Trixie's style. It was RD that instigated the "Anything you can do,  I can do better" deal,  and Rarity and AJ only stepped up when Trixie humiliated their friend in front of them. Seems more or less in character for everyone there to me.

            Technically,  RD was both the one who complained LOUD enough to get Trixie's attention,  and was the only one who physically climbed up on stage,  interrupting the performance to demand an explanation from Trixie.
<p></p>At least AJ and Rarity kept their qualms relatively quiet

            <span class="blue">Rainbow had no problem with Trixie until Applejack and Rarity made it obvious that they EXPECTED her to have a problem with it.  Sure she jumped in with them out of peer pressure,  but she at least wasn't the instigator.  Anyway,  overall kind of a BLUH episode,  I can sort of see why people like Trixie so much now,  but I think she could have been a lot better.  She has a reputation as a Large Ham but she didn't really do much but repeat herself that she was awesome... probably because she was running off a mental script and kept getting interrupted.</span>

<p></p>CRISIS: Equestria is a fanfic which has a premise the there are <em>many</em> Equestrias which are basically <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AUs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AUs">A Us</a> (but more realistic than most <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AUs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AUs">A Us</a>. ie. Their entire political and biological history is different so you aren't going to run into yourself.) Each Equestria has a chronomancer tasked with protecting their own and other Equestrias' space and time (Doctor Whooves is a chronomancer). The Mane 6 get sucked into Equestria 6 which is far more technologically advanced and which is divided into two areas each ruled by a diferent alicorn. Their area is ruled by the evil alicorn. But their link to the elements of harmony means thatby being outside their native universe,  they're endangering both. Meanwhile,  the evil alicorn finds out and clones them before modifying the clones to be her private supersoldiers or Elements of Discord nd wants to use them to corrupt the Mane 6 and prevent them from saving their own world.

            Sounds like a royal clustercuss of a premise. It seems well written so I shall add it to the list.

            @Bad Whoops,  remembered events out of order. In any case,  it was RD who actually booed at her in the first place. AJ stepped up first when directly challenged,  and why wouldn't she? It was a challenge,  and she's not just going to back down from it.
<p></p>Anyway,  right now it's just me defending everything ever because I refuse to see things that I enjoyed as bad,  especially when I can easily justify most problems people seem to have with it (in my head,  at least). Feel free to ignore me.

            There's also a moment I kinda liked near the end.
<p></p>Snips and Snails knock on Trixie's door,  and she answers it relatively nicely,  basically asking what they wanted. It's implied that she was woken up. If you were woken up in the middle of the night by your shit-faced fans that you'd JUST MET the day before,  would YOU be listening to them and be willing to help them out in any way? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
