            @Mousa: I went to a private school(Hence the price - four years in Canadian college usually totals in the range of 10, 000 dollars as opposed to 50 0r 60),  so the system is different. I actually took what would be a four-year course on a condensed course load,  so we went through a lot of the stuff much faster. There's also the fact that we didn't get summer break - we got two weeks off every three months,  and those were our equivalent.
<p></p>So I had a four years course,  just packed down really really tightly.
<p></p>@turtle: I did at first,  but nobody would ever talk to me when I tried,  so I kinda lost heart. But I'm going to be trying to do it again. Gonna do a callback to a company or two tomorrow - I hear it's easier to talk to people on thursdays,  for whatever reason.

            @Apple: Aheh,  sort of. The third quarter nearly killed me when it picked up,  but I got used to it fast enough. The intention is to get us used to the industry - historically it pushes people to work a LOT,  though it's become much better lately. My figuring is if I could handle THAT,  I can handle anything.

            @Psi 001  Hmm after checking that trope page:
<p></p>Rocky and Bullwinkle - well it's focused on show villains so it can't really count as typical play of this trope.
<p></p>Hmm first and second MLP can be this in same way,   it's more focused on witch characters than ponies (and that stupid girl too).
<p></p>I don't think humans in Bayfromers suck too. (Unlike in other Transformers shows).
<p></p>Odd thing,  this  trope never bothered me that much,  at least in live action where it just neccecery to focus (and add them for most time) on humans when turning animated show into live action adaptation (however I think most time making such adaptation is pointless and dumb idea,  and most time I didn't watch those movies).
<p></p>I can't wait for inversion where addaptation is focused on minor or annoying non human character like  Thundercats Live Action - Adventures of Snarf.

            Well,  that was odd. I was playing on the reddit Minecraft server,  when some guy PVP'd me to death and stole my stuff. When I went back to get the remains,  he was standing there. He then gave me all my stuff back,  plus enchanted armor. It kind of restores my faith in humanity,  I guess.

            @What I think that a combination of the fact that ponies already give equal rights to lots of "looks like a pony,  but isn't" species combined with the fact that even human-ish pokemon still clearly aren't human would complicate things a bit.
<p></p>As for game development,  the company I'm working for is now actually starting development on a game,  and I'm going do do my damndest to make sure that it actually has depth. We're starting quite small,  though. Kinda necessary when the whole company consists of two developers,  one designer and 2 freelancer artists who really help us out.

            Most versions of the trope tend to annoy me due to playing the humans as <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate">Audience Surrogate</a> characters or <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman">The Everyman</a>,  ie. dull non descript characters that the audience is supposed to relate to. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonicX" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonicX">Sonic X</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTransformers" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a> are key examples.

<p></p>Usually when they have wacky depthful humans it's not so much of a problem (<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMuppets" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMuppets">The Muppets</a> uses celebrities and lets them run as a loose as possible so isn't that bad at all) but that likely defys the point of the trope.

            @Apple: Eh,  any creative industry is like that. Every so often you have to go into crunch to meet your deadlines.
<p></p>The real reason for it is that people in games can be really,  really lazy,  so a lot of work gets put off until crunch. If I actually sit down and work consistently,  I'll never get a bad crunch. Otherwise it'd be impossible for a designer to ever have a family,  and nobody wants that.
