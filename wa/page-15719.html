<p></p>Yes,  I know. In fact I was thinking of the new mario games when I wrote that. From what I've seen,  there are four main characters: Mario,  Mario's more interseting brother,  and two toadstool guys that noone cares about. I mean why not add Peach and Bowser as <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PCs">P Cs</a> if they're that desperate to round out the cast?
<p></p>Or better yet,  come up with some actual interesting character development and fresh material for a series that's been stagnant longer than I've been alive.

            People claim Sonic went through a Dorkage for a few games,  but Nintendo has been cranking out sub par Mario games for a while. There's over 360 games in the series and I can name maybe 8 good ones.

            From what I've seen Paper Mario TYD is pretty good. But then again,  it's just parodying the main games. I think the problem is that Mario has fallen into Mickey Mouse syndome. As a mascot,  they can't do anything interseting with him and just keep shoveling out the same game with better graphics.

<p></p>Nope,  but <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRant" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRant">let me paint you a picture.</a>
<p></p>It was an original setting,  and the plot of the campaign was essentially that we needed to gather the eight <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffins</a>.  We had already gathered six of them when the GM essentially told us where to find the last two.
<p></p>We did as he said,  and were transported through time and space (somehow.  I wasn't paying much attention to the plot) and ended up in a hallway facing two guys.  It was an encounter suitable for a party about 3 or 4 levels higher than us,  and it left us all pretty drained.
<p></p>We enter the door at the end of the hall,  and we're in a giant room with one of the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffins</a> on a pedestal in the center.  We move towards it,  and suddenly a <a class="urllink" href="http://monsterfinder.dndrunde.de/details.php?id=479&amp;backlink=%2Fallmonsters.php">Bone Ooze<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> drops from the ceiling.  Here I'd like to note that that thing's an encounter suitable for guys level 21 (which is <em>epic level</em>) while we averaged about level 15.
<p></p>Soon,  the ooze starts gobbling us up,  and with my party dying left and right,  I look the thing up in the book and throw a spell at it that ends up transporting it to an alternate dimension.
<p></p><em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">Then</a></em> a hostile <a class="urllink" href="http://monsterfinder.dndrunde.de/details.php?id=617&amp;backlink=%2Fresults.php%3Fid%3D342715344%26skip%3D0">phoenix<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> appears,  which is <em>three levels tougher than the ooze</em>.  Since it's listed as a good-aligned creature,  I attempt to reason with it.  For my trouble,  I get burninated.
<p></p>The last two guys left alive try to run to the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> before the phoenix kills them.  One of them doesn't make it,  and the second manages to grab it.  Then our DM says to him "Roll Fortitude".
<p></p>We later found out just what number he had to get,  and it was impossible for any of us to make without a natural 20.  And that's the story of how that campaign ended.

I want a game where you can play as Zelda. A <em>good</em> game,  not that CD-i stuff.
<p></p>Of course,  the game would have to be named <em>The Legend of Link</em>.

            My last campaign ended with a <em>near</em> total party kill. It was a Star Wars campaign,  and I was playing as The Mole for our big bad(I was a droid,  and my boss was a bounty hunter. The Big Bad paid better,  so I was following programming). IT came out that he Big Bad was a scientist we had been helping out,  so the party tried to kill her,  so I fried our Jedi(with great pleasure). Our pilot and doctor had snuck off during the fight,  and had apparently figured out the prison we were in was a still-operable spaceship,  and so took us into the air. What followed was a zero-G fight between me and the diplomat(Who had taken dodge specifically because everyone kept hitting him)... before the pilot smashed us into the ground,  killing me,  the diplomat and the big bad instantly. The doctor and pilot survived because of seatbelts.
<p></p>Which was a pretty damn satisfying way to end the campaign,  for everyone but the Jedi who spent the rest of the night pissy I killed him.

            The first time I tried to play the <em>Star Wars</em> tabletop RPG was hilariously awful. I was a former dark Jedi trying to get back on the light side,  and the others in my party were Han Solo-esque morally ambiguous types. The GM started us off in Cloud City,  at the same time the craziness from the end of <em>Empire Strikes Back</em> was going down. Stormtroopers everywhere. Unfortunately,  the GM thought <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy">stormtrooper marksmanship</a> was in effect,  and it wasn't. (He actually apologized at the next session for not realizing at the time that stormtroopers were intended for higher-level players.)
<p></p>Anyway,  when we fought our first bunch of stormtroopers,  we set up an ambush and got some lucky rolls,  so we got a very misleading first impression of how easy they were to beat. With our second bunch of stormtroopers,  our ambush failed,  and we took quite a few hits before taking them down. <em>Another</em> group of stormtroopers attacked us before we could recover. I reminded everyone that I was carrying thermal detonators,  so we could use them if all else failed. And pretty soon all else did fail. One by one our party was incapacitated by this third group. The last member standing,  at the urging of everyone else in the group,  yanked a thermal detonator off my unconscious body and threw it.
<p></p>The GM made him roll for the throw. He got a <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalFail" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalFail">Critical Fail</a>. We all laughed at that,  then the GM made him roll to determine the direction of the blast. He got <em>every direction</em>.
<p></p>There were no survivors.

<p></p>I don't think she'd be a bard necessarily. But she would be <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoon">The Loon</a>.
