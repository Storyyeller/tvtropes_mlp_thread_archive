            Ginger likes the Pokemon anime,  with THOSE villains?!?!?!
<p></p>I remember the anime being very kiddy (it's 4Kids what do you expect?) and the heroes seemed to get blander and goody goody in favor of making Team Rocket more likeable.

<p></p>I watched and liked it in the past,  before TTGL,  and I still enjoy it thanks to nostalgia,  but I wouldn't like it if it was new nowadays and I never saw it as a kid

            Pokemon didnt show up until I was around 16 or 17,  so I never got to see it through the eyes of a child.  I watchd it for a while but it was just too cutesy and almost embarassing to be caught watching.

            I watched a bit of the most recent series of the Pokemon anime recently,  and Team Rocket being competent was quite amazing. Unfortunately,  they somehow managed to undo <em>15 years of character development</em> and have Ash be <em>really</em> dumb. Not worth it.

            @Ginger At least for the most part,  you're able to brute force/cheese your way through them without much strategy,  so long as you don't skip fights/experience. Or revive spam. Revive spam usually works too,  in the end game.
