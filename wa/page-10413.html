            @Story,  JT It has dozens of novels and comics explaining backstory,  and every single piece of flavor text on cards is canon,  unless it's one of the quotes from classical literature in the older sets. That's nearly 20 years worth of canon at this point.

<p></p>@J Teeth,  I can,  wisdom isn't inborn,  it's acquired,  odds are she may have been as impulsive as Applebloom and learned a lot from it.

            @J Teeth Also very true,  perhaps she wasn't as impulsive as Applebloom but she has the sort of gung-ho stubborn attitude that would get her into scrapes. She'd be practical sure but there'd be issues.
<p></p>And then I came to the sudden realization I jumped into this conversation without context but if I were to hazard I guess I would say you all are trying to figure out a CMC that has RD,  Rarity,  and AJ.
<p></p>@Drenius,  It's midnight,  the hell are you up to?

            I don't give two cents about sports,  but dude,  that opening Ceremony was beautiful in so many ways,  if I was capable of any more emotion I would've cried,  I could feel it in my throat! I mean it was an awesomegasm of Britishisms! Even if you don't care for the Olympics,  fin a way to see that gorram ceremony!
