            @ginger You were interested in Kid Icarus: Uprising,  right? I just started playing it again recently,  and I still love the dialogue. Pandora was rather interesting,  and I've only played the air part of the Dark Pit stage. He seems really arrogant,  and not all that cunning,  so you might not like him.

            As said before my favorite type of villain is the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain">Not So Harmless Villain</a>,  the one that spends a good portion of the time bumbling and getting frustrated by things not going their way,  but just as the heroes start to take them lightly,  they pull something spectacular to make them crap their pants,  likely still in a completely clownish manner.
<p></p>Dr Eggman in the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonicUnleashed" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a> intro is one of my favorite displays of this.

            My least favorite version of Robotnik is arguably the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatAm" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatAm">Sat Am</a> version,  who is arguably the opposite way round,  he has a very sinister demeanor and is treated as highly deadly and competent,  but makes very arrogant mistakes that are ulitmately his downfall. He lacks the pathos that Eggman got from his bumbling but at the same time his downfalls are twice as stupid.
<p></p>I tend to like a comedic villain that gains audience sympathy from their bumbling and humanized charisma,  but is competent enough to stop just short of making the heroes look like smug assholes against them.

            Path of Radiance is the start of a new arc in Fire Emblem and no prior knowledge is required. That's the one I started with at least.

He suffered a similar problem as the FIM antagonists really. Not to mention some of his malice involved a bit too much suspension of disbelief,  I just don't see him being able to hold onto the entire planet for over a decade with all the dumb tactics he made (one episode even shown Sonic outstrength him humiliatingly and then turn down the opportunity to capture him).
<p></p>The Archie version I think improved on him a little,  he was comical but at the same time you felt he lost for fair reason or because Sonic was <em>that</em> good.
