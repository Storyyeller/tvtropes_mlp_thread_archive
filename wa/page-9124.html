            I'm gonna disagree with that.  I don't think there's necessarily a problem with starting a redemption story with the character already on their way.  In fact that's fairly common isn't it,  for a character to be revealed to have some dark past that they've been trying to make amends for?
<p></p>Also,  slightly more pedantic,  but I don't really think Zuko was on his way to redemption at the beginning of Avatar.  He was still completely devoted to capturing the Avatar when the series started.

            Siiiigh.
<p></p>I hate computers.  I EFFING HATE COMPUTERS!
<p></p>So I thought this one was all fixed,  all hunky-dorey,  and even had a shiny new operating system on it... but for some reason,  just totally at random,  it'll refuse to see the hard drive,  or will claim the installed Operating Systems (its a dual-boot) are corrupt only for them to work fine ten minutes later,  claim there's no hard drive only for the Zorin Live System to see it just fine when I boot from a DVD,  and so on,  so forth,  so kebobble.
<p></p>I don't know what the problem is anymore.  It's clearly not a virus.  It could be a corrupted hard drive or maybe some weak circuitry.  One weird thing is that sometimes when I try to boot the hard disk,  it tells me there isn't one or that it's corrupted... but if I try to boot again later,  it starts up just fine with <em>zero</em> error messages.  It's like its messing with me.

            I mean start off on the road from a narrative,  story structure standpoint. Zuko started off too likeable and sympathetic. We didn't get a chance to see him being villainous before his motives were made clear.
<p></p>Or maybe it was because he was a lame villain and I found him boring as a bad guy,  so I was desperate to see him turn good and get his stupid arc wrapped in the hopes that he'd become even somewhat interesting. Which he did,  thank god.
<p></p>No,  it's definitely both

            Well,  I just placed an order for a 32gb flash drive.  Linux can be installed on and boot from flash drives so this might very well solve everything.
<p></p>Interestingly,  Sandisk and Kingston both have "micro" models that just barely stick out of your laptop.  That'll be convenient for something I'm running the OS from,  so it doesn't accidentally get knocked out while I'm browsing.

            @Crow Because he was pretty much unstoppable in season 3 but didn't have his humour to balance it out.
<p></p>Unstoppability was pretty much my problem with the Order of the White Lotus in general.
<p></p>Don't justify it. Watching the heroes win effortlessly is not fun.

            It also takes guts to use a sword in a children's cartoon since you can't use it to it's full potential.
<p></p>I'm taking into account that Aang was using the power of a thousand Avatars and Ozai still lasted a while. I know that doesn't matter to you but it does to me.

            Ginger doesn't like that kind of story. There's not much more to say than that.
<p></p>I mean,  there's really no way to "justify" it. The White Lotus had comet-boosted master firebenders. The only way the siege could have been repelled was if someone like Azula or Ozai were there to even the odds... and that's not even a sure thing. So yeah,  the Order pretty much steamrollered the Fire Nation forces.
