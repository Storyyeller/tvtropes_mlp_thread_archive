            Yes but there were still natural doors that don't leak dust. And would it have really killed them to create one or two new specters or leak a little extra dust?

<p></p>The art is indeed over the top,  but that's actually why I like it.  It's zany,  like an old cartoon short.

<p></p>Yeah he really knows how to use them just right.  I hear that by contrast,  Buggy the clown never really experiments with his,  and thus stays pretty weak.

            @Wow,  that's pretty early.  Is that still in the Buggy arc?  Glad to hear you're enjoying it,  and it isn't even to the really good parts yet.

I think this is probably the first pony fandom thing that I just flat out DONT GET.  I mean,  it's impressive...but that game kind of already exists.  They could have made an original game,  a pony game if they wanted to,  in the same amount of time (although it would probably have to be much shorter and simpler).  Oh well,  if people like it,  I guess it was worth doing for them.</span>

<p></p>@ginger:  I haven't watched D Gray Man,  but I read the manga and I really like it.  I'm pretty far behind though,  I stopped reading when the update schedule got erratic.
