            I can handle spicy food but I'll avoid it if I can due to a Tom Yum soup that left me with an ulcer.

            On a slightly different topic,  since it was Easter last weekend,  I was wondering if Equestria has an Easter equivalent.  Either as a spring festival of some sort (so would Winter Wrap-Up count?) or the more religious version about a myth of a pony who died and came back to life.

            I like spicy foods,  to an extent. For example,  I'm fine with,  say,  "spicy" salsa with nachos,  but I prefer mild salsa flavor-wise since I enjoy the interplay of flavors more than outright tooth-melting heat. Spicy chili is awesome though,  and my dad makes some of the best chili ever. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin">

<p></p>As for why I like spicy food.... From <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19426_5-things-you-do-every-day-that-are-actually-addictions.html">Cracked<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>:
<p></p>"Go to the snack aisle at your nearest grocery store,  and you'll find three things: sweet,  salty and spicy.
<p></p>Sweet foods make sense — cells use sugar as their primary source of energy. Your body knows this,  so it rewards you for cramming your mouth full of it (to the point that it keeps tasting good to us right up until we've eaten so much that we need a scooter to get around). But why are we so into salt? After all,  salt is just tiny freaking rocks. Or,  even weirder,  stuff that burns our tongue? What exactly are potato chips and jalapeno-flavored everything doing for us?
<p></p>The Addiction:
Let's take on salt first. You need salt (or more specifically,  sodium) to live — it regulates blood pressure and keeps your nerves working. Your body has no means of producing it,  and humans evolved in an environment where salt is a trace element (making it so valuable that in the old days it was commonly used as a form of currency). So your brain has evolved to treat it like precious gold. Or,  you know,  cocaine.
<p></p>Salty foods may in fact act as an antidepressant,  the brain's way of rewarding us for staving off extinction. And just as with any addiction,  the brain doesn't know when to turn it off — the pleasure centers of your brain get accustomed to the high,  demanding more and more. And,  just to make things even worse,  salt may actually contribute to changing our brain chemistry,  so that instead of feeling full after eating,  we just keep craving more. Combining it with fat and other elements in junk food is actually thought to be about as addictive as heroin.
That's why,  while salt may have been rare at one time,  it sure as hell isn't rare in the junk food aisle — the average American consumes over twice as much sodium as needed every day,  which in turn contributes to the 400, 000 heart disease deaths every year.
<p></p>OK,  so what the hell is the deal with spicy or "hot" foods? Why do we voluntary subject our mouths to actual pain,  even from childhood (to the point that one school had to ban Flamin' Hot Cheetos because the kids were so into them that they were leaving trails of that orange powdery residue everywhere)?
<p></p>The chemicals in spicy food irritate the trigeminal nerve,  which is responsible for,  oh,  not much,  just all the sensation in your goddamned face. Scientists theorize that the irritation causes the brain to release endorphins to ease the discomfort by,  well,  giving the eater a natural high. And like any high,  you want it again,  and to make it more intense. That's right — people who love spicy foods are addicted to pain."

            @ginger: Liking Spicy Foods is all about starting small,  and building up a tolerance. As a kid,  I'd never have been able to eat spicy food like I do now - it would be physically painful. Now,  things that people painful to eat barely even register to me.
<p></p>Spicy food actually does have a taste behind the fire. It's this sort of tangy,  sometimes almost pickly taste. Different sauces will have more unique tastes,  and some of them are even completely off the wall - Wasabi tastes a bit smokey,  for example. But they all have this inherent tang to them,  and that's the taste I like. you just have to start small enough,  and as you work your way up the tang will always be present behind the spice.

            I actually despise the vinegar taste that goes with certain spicy foods (Lousiana hot sauce can suck it). Which is odd because I love the more oriental sweet and spicy things. (And certain styles of hot wings)

            @Rainbow The ponies could celebrate Easter but rather the pagan holiday that celebrates the Goddess of the Dawn.  Actually now that I think about it some more I think the Summer Sun Celebration might be similar.
<p></p>@Ilse  Yeah buffalo wings are good.  Its one of the reasons I like the superbowl since its an excuse to go all out on wings.

<p></p>Though Ginger you do gotta give spicy food this,  it's great for clearing out your sinuses.

<p></p>Not liking the songs is understandable,  but did why do you think the characters are obnoxious? Sure they start out as stereotypes and cliches,  but the entire show goes onto to deconstruct (and reconstruct) those,  transforming and developing them into real deep characters in a insanely realistic way.
