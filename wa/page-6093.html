<p></p>Now that I think about it,  though,  that totally makes her social awkwardness meta for me.  Her first impression didn't leave me liking her very much.  At that point I was convinced once I got farther in one of the pegasi would end up being my favourite (I'll admit I had a bit of a pegasus bias going into the show,  since I've always liked them as a creature).  Then Twi brought the full force of her adorkability to bear and stole my heart.  And that's how Equestria was made.
<p></p>Ginger: Part of it might be that AJ's virtues work a little bit against her in that regard.  She's more level headed and less likely to make stupid,  impulsive mistakes.  Which makes her an excellent friend.  Unfortunately,  that also gives her fewer chances to learn spectacular lessons.
<p></p>Star Swirl 147th: I'm sorry,  it was just the first impression!  I thought she was being callously uncaring of Spike.  Actually,  she still was being a bit callous there,  but I can forgive it for all her other virtues.  She is my favourite pony for a reason.

            @crowlover: I agree that Twilight is best pony with Fluttershy being close second.
<p></p>And I also don't dislike anypony.
<p></p>Star Swirl's a Mane Six (and especially Twilight) fanfilly though,  so she feels the need to defend their honour. Still,  as a loyal citizan of Equestria,  she'd hesitate to elevate them above the princesses.

            How how I started watching this show?  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowYourMeme" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowYourMeme">Know Your Meme</a>.  I saw pony stuff in many places before that (deviant art,  this forum),  I was positive about that,  I wanted good pony show but at this point I was convinced that all of them were meh at best. One they when I was on KYM page I saw My Little Pony article,  after reading that I started looking for more pony stuff and check out this show.

            Hm,  I must take the blame for that last infraction. I left the computer to grab a snack,  and my aide decided to share his expertise in character analysis. I shall have to send him to Niflhel for a bit to teach him the dangers of impudence. Also,  Storyyeller,  I get the sense you aren't speaking about me,  per se,  but rather a depiction of me in some form of media.

            Also,  regarding AJ,  I think Kegisak hit the nail on the head: AJ is <em>not</em> very self aware when it comes to the real reasons and motivations behind her actions.  It's all boiled down to "I said I was gonna do this thing,  so I'm going to do it",  without any further thought put into it.  For instance,  in "The Last Roundup",  she said she was going to bring money back to the town,  and she's sticking with that initial goal even after the situation has changed and it isn't the town's highest priority anymore.
<p></p>Or in "Applebuck Season"; she keeps trying to help around town simply because she <em>said</em> she would rather than because she's actually being helpful.  For example,  Pinkie wanted AJ's help with the cupcakes to make the process easier.  AJ agreed,  but she never took the time to realize that she was actually making things worse; rather than thinking "I'm so tired that I'd be more helpful if I stay away",  she thought "I said I'd do this,  so I will" without taking into consideration whether she was actually helping.
<p></p>I have no idea if that makes sense or not.

            Well in a way she does only focus on one thing - that thing happens to be doing something,  without giving thought to something else. It could be called being thick-headed,  in a way - she refuses to let other notions in.
