            Sonic 3 & Knuckles is among my favorite games ever. It holds a very special place in my heart. I remember when I got it in 2002 (I was in and out of hospitals for the first 10 years of my life and didn't even get a video game system until 1999). Fun times.

            I think that video gave me diabetes.
<p></p>I think Sonic 2 was the only one I ever played.  I don't really remember,  I was very young.  I know it had Sonic and Tails and you could play coop,  but Knuckles wasn't in it.

            I could drop into the Sonic discussion that I played Sonic 2 at a friend's home as a kid and,  uh,  I always felt it was kind of boring. Couldn't understand why my friend liked it so much. Still don't like them as a grown up..

            Sonic 2 had some of the best music in the entire damned franchise but Sonic 3 & Knuckles (I'm partial to the Sonic & Knuckles part) is considered the best by many for a reason!
<p></p>Also,  say what you will about the modern games,  the music is still great. And I love the trend that Sonic 06 started with having an orchestral remix of the mane theme for the final boss. I swear,  when I master Logic Pro I will remix every show song to have that style!

            Sonic used to barely break Mach 1 because his running speed was restricted by the physics engine,  then he trained hard and broke Mach 5 by Sonic 3. Now,  in the post-Unleashed era,  with the advent of the Boost power,  he can easily cruise at said supersonic speeds without the need for altitude diving.
<p></p>Dashie is fast and all,  but her specialty is her rapid acceleration and aerobatics-friendly agility,  which lets her dart about rapidly and take turns tightly before accelerating out. Her Rainboom speed is achieved with serious dive acceleration,  so it's more like Samus's Speed Booster/Shine Spark technique in that she needs a good prep and run-up to reach that speed.
<p></p>Also,  Sonic can move fast enough he breaks physics and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telefrag" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telefrag">telefrags</a> himself on "Robotnik's Deadly Speed Traps" by sheer virtue of running faster than even Blast Processing could handle,  or somehow accidentally clipping out of bounds and falling into the Void between worlds. The most Dashie has done to herself is crash badly enough to lay herself up for a few days with a broken wing.
<p></p>Granted,  these days Sonic manipulates his ability to harness the power of Chaos Emeralds to the point that by Generations,  he no longer even needs to go Super to give Perfect Chaos a humiliating headache,  and he even easily trashed the <em>completed</em> Egg Dragoon without brutal Werehog strength. He's older and of a higher experience level,  so it's unfair to compare Modern Sonic to Dashie thataway.
<p></p>In a serious race on a course that favours both of them equally with heights and steep dive points and numerous twists-and-turns and lots of parkour-friendly obstacles,  it would be fun to watch both of them show off against each other. Mostly I think it's unfair to compare them though,  since as I mentioned Sonic's waaaay more experienced than Dashie is. I figure they'll end up friendly rivals :3
<p></p>Also we aren't fractured like the Sonic Fandom,  which has Purists,  Cartoon Hounds,  Furries,  and Crazy Fanon Clowns and Haters shooting at each other with flamethrowers.

            Okay,  fine,  you know what? Why not <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>The reason so many people enjoy the franchise (in this particular case,  the original trilogy) is quite simple: Good ol' platforming. <em>Tons</em> of good ol' platforming. You may say "What the hell,  Light Phaser? Sonic's about speed!",  and although that's true,  look at the very first game! It was rather slow,  but still an enjoyable experience for the most part. Sonic 2 cranked things up. Hell,  it was one of the first games to use Sega's famous "Blast Processing" marketing gimmick,  and it shows. Finally,  Sonic 3 and Knuckles were mere months apart,  so I'll talk about them together. This was finally when Sega "fine tuned" the series,  as this was when the franchise got <strong>big</strong>. Literally! The stages were larger,  alternate paths were now everywhere,  and KNUCKLES,  guys! <em>KNUCKLES</em>!
<p></p>So there. Why I like Sonic.

            There was a nice What If fanfic where Robotnik effectively gave up on his conquests and escaped through a portal with his last Chaos Emerald,  ending up in Equestria somehow. He somehow finds redemption and acceptance and joins the herd.

            I'm asking this as somebody who was a part of the Sonic fandom and stayed away from the drama,  but what is it about the fandom that made it so shattered? And what can we do to prevent the MLP fandom from sinking to their level?

            All I know about Sonic is that it apparently has cool drowning music and Tails tries to steal all your bubbles and kill you. Also,  2006 is a yer that will live in infamy.

<p></p>In all seriousness,  it's very hard to tell. Taking the time to psychologically examine the entire Sonic fandom is more than likely just not worth it. If we as a fandom try not to break anything in anger and not tape the rose-tinted glasses to our faces,  we should be fine.

            It was Sonic Adventure that fractured it wasn't it? Or at least the addition of 3D game play. Then there was the Shadow thing and that the games were getting worse every release. Until Unleashed pulled it out of the nosedive.

<p></p>From a logical standpoint,  yes,  that may have been the cause. Unfortunately,  the Sonic fandom simply doesn't understand logic. No,  seriously,  they just <em>don't</em>.

            You know,  if I had proper art assets I would love to code a Daring Do fan game. Unfortunately,  my language of choice when it comes to games isn't very fan-game friendly. I write for Macs and iOS devices,  meaning that I wouldn't be able to release said fan-game even if I actually made it. It would need to be written in either Java or Flash,  and I don't have any experience with either.
