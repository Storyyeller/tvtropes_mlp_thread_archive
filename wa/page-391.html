            I like to see Celestia as something of  tragic character
<p></p>"A thousand years ago i banished my only sister to the moon"

<p></p>"A thousand year i have seem my friends grow old and die while i was raised to a position of reverence,  insure i could never see other ponies as equals,  no mater how much i wanted it."
<p></p>"a thousand years later my sister was released,  ready to destroy the world again."
<p></p>"Heaven help me but i could not go through and banish her again so i layed that responsibility at the hooves of a innocent unicorn"

            ^Well,  Canterlot's not that far from Ponyville,  and Celestia does have a habit of dropping in (and not always to see Twilight,  after all).  She could very well know Rarity and Rainbow Dash by reputation if not sight,  at least,  and the Apple clan must be a fixture of Ponyville.  The fact that Spike knows Rainbow Dash's name when they arrive in Ponyville suggests that she did give them at least a few names to look for,  and presumably knew the girls at least a little bit.
<p></p>Alternately,  Celestia's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SincerityMode" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SincerityMode">wise and benevolent</a> plan was simply 'go outside and talk to people you might not meet normally; you might be surprised'.  =)
<p></p>^Nicely written!

<p></p>Imortality is actually i think alot about,  the book referenced in my sig?
<p></p>The robot is from a imortal race of non-transforming synthetic life,  and while they can replace parts eventually no amount of services will help and their imortal "spark" continues to exist in a body that can't move,  see,  hear,  or talk,  they can barly think,  they just exist...a few were able to be brought back onlines with advances in medicine only to go stark raving mad. And this condition effects the entire race,  even if their body is destroyed some part of their "spark" clings to some part of their scraps...FOREVER.
<p></p>The spirit has lived inside a machine for eons,  she he can conunicate and guide people as the Zordon but he has know what the sense of touch,  taste,  or smell has been for eons,  only sight,  sound,  and memory...he's a bit...jaded.

I created a handful of immortals over the course of a few storylines and I realized I had basically doomed them to all those things you mentioned and,  therefore,  probably mental insanity.  Granted,  in hindsight,  I might have written one of them a bit too well adjusted,  so I guess he's happy until I go back and do revisions. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">  But getting off that tangent before it goes too far,  basically when I found out Celestia was 1000+ years old,  my first reaction was :/

Haha,  that's more clever than I expected.  Derpy so needs to be Pinkie Pie's unpredictable partner in crime if Minty isn't going to be around,  and she should just keep <em>saying</em> "muffins" without ever actually eating them.
<p></p>Also,  am I the only one who wonders if Derpy's fanon job may not even exist thanks to teleporting mail?

It doesn't help that I watched Full Metal Alchemist last year,  so the Princess's visits remind me of Fuhrer Bradley.  But nah,  I'm sure she's more like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fuhrer Grumman</span>.

I imagine boredom is a greater problem for Celestia,  but I don't think she would stick around so long if it were making her depressed.

Hence why I'm trying to start a meme that goes like "Pinkie Pie for Queen,  Twilight Sparkle for Prime Minister."

<p></p>I highly doubt it. For one thing,  Fluttershy's reaction indicates that Spike is the only dragon in Ponyville. For another,  he only seems to be capable of sending mail back and forth to Celestia.

            Even,  then it's possible that it only works on paper,  and package delivery still requires mail ponies.  I mean,  the one time we actually saw her "at work" she was moving packages.

            Exactly.  I bet they settled for Derpy as a mover because they were told letters weren't delivered that way.

            Going back a bit to Tyrant Celestia,  I've always sort of liked to think of her as a troll-tyrant hybrid - she's not outright evil,  but she likes being in charge because it puts her in a much better position to mess with people without being reprimanded,  so she tries her best to keep her position.

            ^^I think it is the dragonflame that makes the letters teleport.  If it were some innate magic in the scrolls,  it would apparently still need a dragon to activate it,  and thus be useless to the 99.9% of Equestrians who didn't have a friendly baby dragon on their contacts list.
<p></p>^Oh,  I have no doubt that Celestia enjoyed that benefit of her royalty when she was growing up.  But also,  keep in mind that she's tens of times older than any of her subjects.  If you want to talk about the wisdom of age... in any case,  I seriously doubt she's done anything that required her to hide behind 'you can't get mad at me,  I'm the princess' for several hundred years.
<p></p>...Now I want to see a fic about Celestia's wild youth.

If Luna becomes a key player in season 2 we'll likely get a scene or two that takes place before her transformation to Nightmare Moon. Then we can see what Celestia and Luna were like back in the day.
