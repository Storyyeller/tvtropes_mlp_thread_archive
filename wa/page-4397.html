            @ Kegisak,  Molestia has a rule 63 ray that she used on Braeburn recently.  I'll let you figure out the rest.

            Wow,  those cupcakes look yummy!  Spike can have the sapphire one since that's the one he got in the show,  and I'd like the amethyst one since my favorite color is purple.
<p></p>About Feeling Pinkie Keen,  Twilight's behavior in that episode reminds me of a character I played once in a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorMoon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a> RPG.  He basically could NOT accept the fact that not only were Sailor Senshi real,  but that he was one himself as well,  and despite claiming to be a true scientist,  he often let his desire to have the universe work the way he thought it should interfere with following a more unbiased scientific method.  He actually did try to study Senshi powers a few times,  but it was thwarted either because he wasn't allowed to go where he needed to for his study purposes (it involved interstellar travel,  which was possible in the RPG but he had to go through someone who wouldn't let him use it) or because he tended to deteriorate into just trying different methods to destroy his <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket">Transformation Trinket</a> because he felt somehow if he got rid of his own powers then the concept of "Sailor Senshi" and "magic" would cease to exist.  He basically was being an even more extreme version of the way Twilight approached Pinkie Sense in that episode.
<p></p>Those questions are interesting,  too,  CDRW.  Some possible answers:
<ul><li>Perhaps the forbidden topic ponies would have about humans would involve something ponies think is sexually alluring about other ponies that humans don't have?  I don't know quite what that would be,  outside of something like the fact that horses have tails and people don't.
</li><li>If the question about Apple Bloom is concerning Cheerilee,  she might feel guilty,  especially if the pregnancy caused Cheerilee to have to take time off from teaching and there was a substitute that Apple Bloom didn't get along with.  Come to think of it,  that could be an interesting story for the Cutie Mark Crusaders,  where at least one of them gets annoyed at Cheerilee and wishes someone else could be their teacher,  and then something happens that makes Cheerilee unable to teach for awhile and they end up wishing she would come back.  Add extra guilt points if the reason Cheerilee can't teach is because she's injured or sick,  especially if it's the fault of the one who wished for a different teacher (whether accidentally or something done on purpose that went down the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">Gone Horribly Right</a> path).

<p></p>I actually had an idea that (spoiled so people who don't want to read it don't have to) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> if mares go into heat,  especially if it's more than once a year (perhaps monthly,  like a menstrual cycle),  wouldn't sex aids be extremely popular for them,  as well as almost completely destigmatized?  If your options as a society are A) shame every single adult female into hiding once a month,  B) be open and supportive and provide options for said adult women,  and C) deal with a <em>metric ton</em> of foals every year,  the choice is fairly clear,  especially in a society like Equestria.</span>
