            What's interesting about the Chinese Zodiac is that my dog,  Luna,  actually was born in the year of the Dog (2006) so I have a dog whose Zodiac is the Dog!
<p></p>This Zodiac discussion makes me wonder if ponies have things like astrology,  with beliefs that certain positions of stars and planets predict things (like events or ponies' personality traits).  I know they have constellations,  at least.  Constellations that turn out to be giant creatures,  in the case of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor.

Catscratch doesn't usually proc cast-on-hit spells iirc.

            @Nomuru: That's a complicated question.  It's really hard to compare real life racial issues to pony races  because in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> race is largely aesthetic.  The differences are primarily cultural rather than due to inherent biology.  With the ponies,  each race has very different inherent skill sets,  which means that racial discrimination in Equestria isn't <em>entirely</em> unjustified in some cases.  Not that stuff like unicorn supremacy is at all justified (it isn't; the races have different abilities,  but ultimately I think they're all about the same in terms value to the country as a whole),  but in specific situations race would be a valid factor.  I.e. if you were an Earth Pony,  you'd probably never get a job at a weather factory,  for obvious reasons.

<p></p>Wood Pigs are strong-minded individuals who give of themselves continuously. They have hearts of gold and won’t take no for an answer from a friend in need. These Pigs are practical,  down-to-earth and industrious people,  always looking for the next project to take on. They enjoy working in groups and work well with other people. </div>
<p></p>Hmm,  somewhat correct for me.

            Metal sheep
<p></p><em>Sheep often display a tough exterior to protect the fragile interior they are notorious for. Close friends and family of the Metal Sheep understand this is simply a front for those sensitive emotions tucked inside. Sheep can sometimes treat others the way they feel instead of the way they wish to be treated which can lead to a tendency to be overprotective and vulnerable. Metal Sheep,  more than other Sheep,  are culturally stimulated and hold a deep passion for the arts. </em>
<p></p>Hmmm. Close in some areas,  a little off in others though.

            @crowlover: I'm not sure.  It depends on how much the social climate has changed since 1966.  From things I've read,  there probably would be at least a little more support for girls born in that year,  but I'm not sure what things would be like in Japan in 14 years.  But there are now books and support groups being started that would possibly be able to counteract the superstition that girls born in the future year of 2026 might face.

            @stevebat: I agree,  same with the Western Zodiac when it comes to months.  Not to mention it would have to work by magic since it assumes a geocentric universe (or at least the sun sign thing does).  Which is why I'm unsure how it would work with Equestria,  given that the sun and moon seem to work differently there than they do in the real world.

        </div>
        
        <div class="post-content">
            Let's see what it says about me:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">The Tiger is said to be lucky vivid,  lively and engaging. Another attribute of the Tiger is his incredible bravery,  evidenced in his willingness to engage in battle or his undying courage. Maybe he’s so brave because he is so lucky. But the Chinese say a Tiger having a Tiger in the house is the very best protection against the evils of fire,  burglary.
<p></p>Tigers do not find worth in power or money. They will be completely honest about how they feel and expect the same of you. On the other hand,  they seek approval from peers and family. Generally,  because of their charming personalities Tigers are well liked. Often,  failing at a given task or being unproductive in his personal or professional life can cause a Tiger to experience a depression. Criticism from loved ones can also generate this type of Tiger reaction. Still,  like all felines,  Tigers always land on their feet,  ready for their next act in life,  pursuing it with unyielding energy and hunting it infallibly.
<p></p>Tigers are also incorrigibly competitive - they simply cannot pass up a challenge,  especially when honor is at stake,  or they are protecting those they love. Tigers are unpredictable and it would be unwise to underestimate their reactions. They may appear cool,  but they have the Big Cat's instincts to pounce at a moment's warning. Natural leaders,  they have a strong sense of their own dignity,  and if they find
<p></p>themselves in the ranks,  they can be stubborn and obstinate. In positions of power they can be difficult though stimulating bosses. Tigers are intelligent,  alert,  and farsighted. They have their fingers on the pulse. Good strategists and tacticians,  they often have a hidden agenda. As long as they do not risk their luck too often,  and keep their restless nature under control,  their tactics usually pay off in life.
<p></p>CHARACTERISTICS
<p></p>Courage,  Vehemence,  Self-Reliance,  Friendliness,  Hopefulness,  Resilience,  Vanity,  Disregard
<p></p>THE FIRE TIGER 1926 AND 1986
<p></p>Eccentric and dramatic,  Fire Tigers are aglow with passion and verve. They are outgoing,  expressive and look on the bright side of things. They have the Tiger’s natural ability to lead others and are able to excite others simply with their own gift of enthusiasm. They can be funny and have great senses of humor. Tigers are powerful speakers and have the ability to command and persuade crowds through speech. Their own seemingly endless supply of energy can make them appear a bit dramatic,  and it may make them more sensitive to cautious or down-to-earth approaches in others.
<p></p>HEALTH AND HOME
<p></p>HEALTH
<p></p>Tigers tackle everything in their lives in brief bursts of energy,  collapsing afterwards in a heap of exhaustion. Normally they are soon back to full strength,  but their approach can cause their long-term health to suffer. They should take it a little easier and learn to pace themselves to keep active longer and to prevent early burnout. They are blessed with flexibility and recover quickly from illness or pain. They owe it to themselves to relax a little. Along with the fitness of their long-term health,  Tigers must be aware of how they react to and are affected by the consequences of their tempers. A Tiger’s meanest enemy is the damage he can inflict upon himself in the midst of a temper tantrum.
<p></p>AT HOME WITH THE TIGER
<p></p>Tigers take pride in being different than others and generally illustrate their originality best in their homes. Tigers can utilize their atmosphere with color and light. A Tiger’s home will be filled with exotic treasures from trips past and will include items such as Tibetan prayer mats or African carvings,  confirming their desire to travel to distant places.
<p></p>CAREER AND FINANCE
<p></p>THE TIGER ON THE JOB
<p></p>A quickness and an alert intelligence make Tigers fast learners. Tigers need a challenge. Add this to them being easily bored and it explains why Tigers tend to change careers more often than other Chinese Animals. Some Tigers don’t change their occupations frequently enough and thus tend to juggle jobs all at the same time. Most Tigers are natural born leaders who perform best knowing they are working towards positions of power and influence.
<p></p>MONEY AND THE TIGER
<p></p>Tigers depend on luck. They like to spend money,  and also to share it. They can be quite impulsive spenders because they know they can always make more. Somehow,  as luck would have it,  they discover the end of the rainbow just before complete bankruptcy. They are willing to lose a fortune in their lifetime,  if it means they will wind up with two.
<p></p>FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
<p></p>Tigers,  born under the third Animal sign of the Chinese Zodiac,  have the ability to lift the spirits of even the most depressed or lonesome individual they meet. Because of that attitude,  Tigers have no problem making new friends. Actually,  a Tiger person without a friend is quite miserable and sad. Like the Dragon,  the Monkey,  and the Rat,  Tigers are most comfortable surrounded by friends and family.
<p></p>As friends,  Tigers are exceptionally warm and incredibly generous with their time,  attention and money. Friends are always welcome in a Tiger’s home and will most often be greeted with a cup of coffee,  an ear,  a tissue,  an open mind and an open wallet. Few friends could be as caring and affectionate,  as quirky and surprising,  or as genuinely interested as the Tiger.
<p></p>VIRGO TIGER
<p></p>These Tigers can be pretty picky when it comes to choosing a partner. They have an eye for detail that can cause them to be a little neurotic at times.</div>
<p></p>Well,  the biggest descrepencies I see is that I tend to be more introverted and cautious than this implies. Ignoring those massive issues,  not too bad.
<p></p>EDIT: Oh,  and I'd rather follow than lead. Another big difference.
