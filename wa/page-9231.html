            Also there's of course the issue that haranguing a pacifist into even <em>helping</em> you kill someone is a <em>huge</em> dick move. It's like haranguing a muslim or jewish person into eating pork. You're forcing them to go against their beliefs,  no matter how 'right' the cause is.

            So far,  in the story,  she's taken one Party Time Mint-Al in chapter 6 before getting on the train,  and one garden variety Mint-Al in chapter 9 when she needed a boost to pick a lock. Unless I glazed over out of general boredom and missed a detail,  she isn't on any fucking drugs when it happens.

            and as ginger said,  Velvet was not bullied into it,  she agreed with the necessity of it,  she went along because as much as she hated it,  she know it was the best option they had to prevent even more ponies from dying.
<p></p>her objections were not her actaully trying to get out of it or stop it,  it was just a formality becuase as much as she know it was the only choice she still hated it and couldn't accept it wihtout at least some show of hesitation.
<p></p>again she was CONVINCED,  not bullied. And as to mint-als,  for most ponies,  yeah not to bad,  but Pip is especially sensitive to both the addiction and side effects.
<p></p>and as Ginger sid the side effect of mint-als is a permanent decline in all mental functions when not on the drug,  and the more you take,  the dumber and slower you get while not on them

            @kegi She is a technical pacifist. She accepts that sometimes violence is the only option,  she just doesn't want to be a part of it directly. (which is fair enough imo)
<p></p>That she was able to help without needing to kill anyone (in a way that caters to her special talent) is what made Pip's plan appealing to her.
<p></p>She objected because that's who she is,  she wants confirmation that there's no other way first

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">her objections were not her actaully trying to get out of it or stop it,  it was just a formality becuase as much as she know it was the only choice she still hated it and couldn't accept it wihtout at least some show of hesitation.</div>So she's only ever gonna provide token resistance. Gotcha.

            @keg During Pip's addiction arc,  you're meant to be going DAMMIT,  Pip! OPEN YOUR FUCKING EYES AND SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO YOUR FRIENDS!!
<p></p>I admit,  I hated Pip for a time,  but I kept reading because of her friends and her good intentions beneath the drugs. (if others can't tolerate her like that completely then that's totally fair enough)
<p></p>but for me personally,  it makes the moment where she gets off the drugs and sees what she's been doing so <strong>SO</strong> satisfying

            No more "I am willing to accept that sometimes circumstances make something i find wrong,  the only option." She doesn' LIKE the idea,  at all,  she only accepts it as a neccessity,  the singing part was just a bonus for her,  it gave her away to do something she loved,  and help take her mind off what was happening.

            @Chad: which is NOT a mindset I approve of. If you are willing to sacrifice your an ideal,  for a result,  THE RESULT IS WORTHLESS. At the very least,  YOU have committed a crime and you must accept the responsibility for that. I sincerely doubt this story allots any time to Velvet coming to terms with the fact that because of her,  somepony is dead?

            No she will not 'only pervide token resistance' if she really believes there is another option,  but at that moment there wasn't one. she will stand up for her beliefs if she sees a way to uphold them that won't result in even more ponies getting hurt.
