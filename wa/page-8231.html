            @Seraphem: It's not hypocritical,  per se. It just defeats the purpose a bit; the whole MMDW thing was to show that you can be a hero without glorying in it,  and then...MMDW goes a head and accepts all the adulation.  It just seems counterintuitive to the main plan.

            My complaint with a lot of RD moments is that she sometimes ends up the go to jerk character,  and they enforce a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong">The Complainer Is Always Wrong</a> setup into her that allows the others to condescend over her,  compared to many other situations which accept characters of any personality can be right or wrong. There are exceptions,  but she does seem a bit more leaned into the 'stupid and wrong' type.

            I kinda wish they'd give RD more moments she makes a point over the team,  similar to Pinkie sometimes proving Twilight and others wrong. I get making an aggressive character look right is problematic,  but let's face it,  it's not always the wrong way.
<p></p>Maybe that's why I like the AJ vs RD rivalry,  RD is usually the more provokative of the two,  but it points out AJ is so self righteous and one track driven about trying to prove her wrong she obliterates her own point.

            @ginger: I think it works in balanced doses with when she is wrong,  especially against Twilight.
<p></p>Twilight reminds me of Sally Acorn,  however while Twilight gets lessons that her logical 'by the book' methods won't always win,  the world always folds to Sally,  with Sonic or someone else making a fool of themselves when they argue with her. This also kinda gave Sonic the same problem as RD,  making him dumb muscle that always needed to be taught a lesson.

            It's just I tend to find AJ much duller as a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a> than her flawed moments. Not to say she should always be wrong,  just I wish they'd make her more logical moments as interesting as her flawed ones like they do with Twilight,  then maybe I wouldn't savor her acting up as much.
<p></p>I dunno I guess I just like when Straight Men get kicked off their high horse. Twilight usually works because she is too exasperated to look holier than thou about it.

But you don't really need to know them to follow the story.
<p></p>Personally,  I really don't see the jerkiness in their actions. I have problems with the episode,  but that isn't one of them. As I've said before,  I still preffer it to half of Season 1's episodes.

            I don't hate her warm moments,  I just wish they enfuse them more with her actual personality quirks like they do with Twilight,  even when Twilight is kind and smart,  she is a bit dorky and befuddled. AJ seems a bit generic at times outside her accent.
<p></p>@marston: Sally suffered a bit of this problem in Season Two,  a lot of episodes revolved around Sonic ignoring Sally and screwing up. In the comics she's not only Sue-ish but kinda bland,  lacking any of the neurotics or ego that humanized her.
