<p></p>That would be an...interesting reveal.

            Their parents being dead is what makes the most sense and is wht Lauren originally envisioned. So it's what I'm asuming.
<p></p>What's wrong with disabled characters and orphans anyway?
<p></p>Anyway,  we must remember that a future episode is hinted to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a history episode including Discord.</span> Which will of course be awesome.
<p></p>I still see Rarity's increased affection towards Spike as being promising of future canon Sike/Rarity.

This isn't true,  of course,  but its possible SA was suppose to have an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early-Bird Cameo</a> in the show sometime before the wedding episodes. Makes me wonder where... "Return of Harmony"? At Twilight's birthday party in "Sweet &amp; Elite"?

            @Lopiny AJ is AB's 'de facto' mother,  she raised her in the parents absence. So she acts like a mother. Rarity doesn't. We see clearly in Sisterhooves social that she has lots to learn about her relationship with SB.
<p></p>If she was secretly her mother,  that won't be the case.

            I could see AJ's parents being traveling types. If you remember,  they weren't there to see AJ off when she went to Manehattan,  which was presumably before Apple Bloom was born. If their occupation is the kind that you simply can't have children along for,  then it makes sense to leave the kids back with Granny Smith.
