            <div class="quoteblock"> How can Habsro use names like "Lyra" in toys with no fear of being sued by whoever named her first on the Internet? </div>
Because it's Habsro and not Hasbro!  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_wink.png" height="16" width="16" alt="wink" title="wink">  But seriously,  I'm starting to doubt that the blind bag set Equestria Daily showed us is the real deal,  based on things like the suspicious construction of the alicorn mold,  so I'm not that excited about it yet.  Still,  it must be either a very good fake or a leaked mock-up to be able to get so much of the graphic placement and the translations correct.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> It's honestly funny though,  before that episode I'd always considered the pegasi to be the most... I don;t know,  frail? Effite? Lithe? Of all the races. Just because I sort of assumed they'd have to be - Hollow bones,  and all that. </div>
Funny,  I had this idea that alicorns might be the most physically frail kind of pony,  due to their abnormal spread of abilities and always coming out so thin,  and that's why we don't see very many of them.  Only the princesses learned enough magic to keep themselves in good condition for so long.

            @story Thst's what I've been saying,  the Alicorns have their own country (like Asgard in the Marvel universe) but they refuse to meddle in the affairs of the rest of the world. The Princesses are 2 who decide to flee their homeland and travel the world helping in any way they can.
<p></p>Then the Discord thing happens and they pick up the elements of harmony,  then they stay to help the ponies rebuild... then they just grow attatched over the years and eventually decide to settle down <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

I never read that,  but I did read a comic where Pinkie Pie simply described how she discovered she had diabetes,  and it was kind of funny to see her try and fail to treat it with her usual irreverence.

            Actually,  if Cadence is a real bitch (think the ham quotient of Luna,  combined with the expectations that her subjects treat her as infallible,  lacking Luna's element of penitence),  she could be the best antagonist thus far. =)  It won't be because she's an alicorn,  though,  or she wouldn't be marrying a unicorn.

That's why I'm hoping "Bridezilla meltdown" will be the plot they go with.  And then in the final part we learn she had good reason for acting the way she did. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_evilgrin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="evil grin" title="evil grin">

            @Ginger: Uh... forgive me for not recalling their names exactly right if I get this wrong,  but isn't Viserys the eunuch? A pretty big difference between him and Jeoffery,  isn't there?
<p></p>I think if there is a villain it'll be an outside force. Neither of the happy couple are really designed as villains,  so I doubt they'll be that bad.

            Reading through some of the backlog:
<p></p>Talking about Pony ages:  In Winter Wrap Up,  Ponyville is established as at least 300 years old.  Granny Smith founded Ponyville.  Therefore,  we know that Ponies can live for centuries.  But since Celestia and Luna's longevity is considered unusual,  and Granny Smith is obviously near the end of her lifespan,  we can assume Ponies don't live much more than 300 years or so.  I'd like to think the average age is around 200-250 years.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Does anyone complain about Applejack being offensive to Texans or Rarity being offensive to upper class Brits? </div>
<p></p>She certainly doesn't <em>offend</em> me,  but Applejack's stereotypical nature does make her less interesting to me than most of the other characters (and yeah,  I'm Texan).  Rarity doesn't bother me at all though,  because it's pretty clear her little accent is an affectation rather than her actual character.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Just how rich is Rainbow Dash anyways? No way she could afford that house on weather duty salary. </div>
<p></p>It's constructed out of clouds.  She probably made it herself.
<p></p>Game of Thrones discussion: Excellent.  Continue.

            @Kegisak:  Dany (that's how it's spelled in the books) is short for Daenarys.  She was thirteen in the books (at the start anyway) but in the show she was probably meant to be 16 or 17 (though she's played by a 20-something actress).
<p></p>Armor acting like Viserys would be the Worst. Possible. Thing! considering his sister is Twilight.
