            Actually,  yeah... they're not terribly KIND comment all in all,  but at least they're not,  you know,  horribly racist and all that.
<p></p>For my own part... I do see where they're coming from. Your style tends to exaggerate a lot of features,  and while that work a lot of the time I think you may want to keep it out of pose. I actually agree with Niggertron there; they do look a bit... apish,  especially with the leaning forward.
<p></p>I honestly think that a lot could be done if their poses were more relaxed and natural. As it is they feel stiff and awkward,  and making them 'feel' more human would go a long,  long way to improving how people take the art. The rest is really just a matter of style and refinement,  which I can't really give you any advice on ans 'practice'. Don't be discouraged by people telling you that you're too green(I am aware that you've been at this for less time than I,  but still),  because the only way to get good is to be bad.

            Wait,  wouldn't that make it a self-insert movie then?
<p></p>Also,  I left a comment on Mousa's picture.  I do think it has a few issues,  but I know he's a good artist and he shouldn't let this get him down.  I have to agree with Keg that the main issue is the posing; since they're all in the same position it makes the exaggerations in the designs stand out a lot more than it would if they were just hanging around.

            maybe applelight limited. might be good idea. currently at impasse anyway. attempts to work on original projects resulting in less than stellar results due to lack of inspiration. for some reason obsessive energies are focused on this show despite my other building obsessions but I hate everything about this due to the high to low effort-to-result ratio caused by originality humanity invisibility etc.
<p></p>-24 is not logical. not with all the hours and time and effort and thought. these things do not come out of thin air,  entire days go to the colouring and inking process. In the time it takes me to complete these painstaking pains in the rears,  I blow by entire series,  I watched so much Futurama making that monstrosity,  it's not even funny.
<p></p>But Joseco produces uninspired 30 minute shock and all of sudden he's a god among bronies? Well what do they know?
<p></p>But it was never supposed to be so bad <br>I hoped the world would learn,  but how could they?! <br>
All this time I wanted to give them something new <br>Why can't everything just turn out like it should? <br>
Well what the heck,  <br> I went and did best,  <br> and boy I really tasted something fun!
<p></p>Why for a moment I <br>Had comments to the sky <br>And I did it all without losing any steam <br>I did!
<p></p>And some time ago <br>I don't remember when <br>I was feeling less like my pathetic self back then
<p></p>And I,  MOUS- <br>-SA THE 14!
<p></p>Why yes,  I am Mousa the 14! <br>KUKUKUKUKUKUKUKUKUKU!

            @Mousa The thing about Joseco,  though is that what he draws is just <em>good</em>. The difference between him and you,  though is that he doesn't experiment. People already like his style,  and he likes his style,  so why should he? You,  on the other hand,  are doing risky things. If you're going to react this badly when people react negatively to an odd style,  then you shouldn't be doing such an odd style.
<p></p>Think about why you're drawing. Are you drawing for yourself,  or to get attention of others? If you're drawing for yourself,  then why do you even care what people think about your art? If you're drawing because you want people to look at what you drew,  then you're going to have to take a hint when people tell you what they do and don't like. Find what they <em>do</em> like and enhance it,  and find what they don't like and tone it down. If you notice,  none of the really unique choices of your style (the races,  unique body types) are what people don't like. You can adapt to the wills of your audience without sacrificing your integrity and vision.

I get that the sameyness of the humanizations bugs you,  but that's hardly the only thing the guy draws.
<p></p>EDIT: <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Also this. His style doesn't evolve much,  no,  but that's because it really doesn't need to.  Yes,  his humanizations have an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">Only Six Faces</a> thing going,  but the fact that <em>the show itself does the same thing</em> proves that you don't need to give everyone unique body types to make it work.  I do wish there was more variation,  but on the whole his designs are pretty good,  and his pony art is really good.  The other thing is that he isn't just popular because of his quality,  he's popular because <em>he's drawn hundreds of pictures</em>.  Even if the art is only middling,  if you put out that much stuff people are going to notice.
<p></p>And like Perpetual said,  it comes down to the fact that you're the artist,  and if you don't want to pander to the majority,  you don't have to.  But at the same time,  the fact that the majority doesn't share your taste in humanizations doesn't make them wrong either.  If they're dicks about it,  they're dicks,  but just because they prefer JJ's designs to yours doesn't make them idiots.

            @Story: Best I can tell,  he's angered that JJ basically spouts out that mass-produced style and gets a ton of recognition for it,  while he spends a lot of time building something unique and it wasn't well received.  Unfortunately,  originality and uniqueness doesn't usually equate to popularity.  The reason a lot of pony fanart is similar looking is simply because people like it more.  JJ probably settled on that style specifically <em>because</em> people like it.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">That just looks freaky.
<p></p>In any case,  I really need to get to bed,  so I'm just gonna leave this here:
<p></p>@Mousa: I get that you're frustrated by the fandom's preferences; it sucks.  But at the same time if you enjoy drawing MLP fanart,  you should keep doing it,  and if you don't enjoy it,  don't.  But don't give up doing something you enjoy because some people are idiots.  Your designs may be incredibly unorthodox,  but it gives them a charm that a lot of artwork doesn't have,  and it would be a pity for you to stop working on it.
<p></p>@Everybody: Goodnight,  people.  Must sleeps.
