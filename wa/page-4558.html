            Wait,  Ginger,  <em>how</em> did Pinkie's Looney Tunes bit not earn this episode a black mark on average?  Does she improve that much?
<p></p>(Granted,  that actually annoys me a little bit,  even.  The sign does clearly say two bits,  so it's not like the storekeeper was bullying extra cash out of Fluttershy.)

            @Fluttershy's anger.
<p></p>it's possible that fluttershy has repressed anger. But most of the time she is also being like that becuase she is kind and she puts others before her.

            I think Angel is just a spoiled brat,  this episode is about Fluttershy learning to be a tough parent to him and still retain a nice demeanor around others.

            @Free: Basically? About a month or so back somebody mentioned Persona 4,  and how good it was. I remembered a bit about one of the characters,  Kanji Tatsumi,  from a video I had seen before. I watched the video again,  which basically detailed why his character and his personal struggle made the game more dynamic and interesting. A bit more digging into the game and it basically sounds like <em>exactly</em> the kind of game I want to play - deeply cerebral,  extremely tightly themed around two things I find very interesting (mythology and psychology),  with a rich story and good characters.
<p></p>The problem? I graduate in a couple of weeks,  and basically need to work constantly to get my demo reel done. I've looked into it,  and I'm basically set to order the game and the necessary system as soon as I graduate,  but until I do I'm <em>insanely</em> impatient to play it. I'm beginning to look into more avenues to fuel my desire to play it (ie. tarot symbology,  mythology,  reading the wiki on it),  but,  well... I'm sure by now my thoughts on spoilers are clear. So I'm in a weird play where I desperately want to consume something related to it,  but don't want to for fear of ruining the experience. I've basically turned to applying what I <em>do</em> know of it to ponies,  and I'm sort of working myself into a knot over the whole thing. So yeah,  kind of going a little bit insane,  yeah.
