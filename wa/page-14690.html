            I read something that bothered me on the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">Alternate Character Interpretation</a> page for the show.  Basically,  unless I'm interpreting something wrong,  it sounds like some people are taking the way the PAST is shown to be in Hearth's Warming Eve and assuming that modern Equestria has the same racist class system.  It's like they were completely missing the point of the episode,  which was to show how bad things USED to be before the three types of ponies united equally to form Equestria.  And just because Celestia has a school for gifted unicorns,  it doesn't mean that unicorns "control learning" in general; aside from Celestia,  the only other main teacher in the story is an Earth pony,  Cheerilee.  It's just that young unicorns would need to be taught how to use their powers properly just like how pegasi have flight school.
<p></p>I guess people might be assuming that ponies would see Earth ponies as inferior because they can't fly or cast spells but outside of the Hearth's Warming Eve play,  which is explicitly set in the past,  this issue doesn't ever come up in the show itself.  Not to mention there ARE some very prominent high-class Earth ponies such as Diamond Tiara,  Silver Spoon,  Hoity Toity and Photo Finish.
<p></p>It's kind of a fandom <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> of mine (along with the "Celestia is a tyrant!" thing),  especially the implication that Earth ponies are all lower-class or are actually seen as inferior in the show itself.  Even if they don't have physical abilities the others do (and they might have physical talents of their own too),  it doesn't mean that other ponies necessarily see them as mentally inferior or unsuited for being leaders.
<p></p>I suppose some of it is that some people might be extrapolating Applejack and Rarity/Twilight as what all members of their pony type are like,  but it seems more like the fans are the ones being racist instead of the ponies.  (and forgetting that the Hearth's Warming Eve play is set in the past and not meant to be how modern Equestria is)
<p></p>It's like if someone saw a movie set in pre-Civil War America and got the idea that Americans currently own slaves because they saw it in the movie or something and didn't realize that it was set in the past.

            Agreed. Aside from deliberately deconstructive or dark fics,  I really get tired of fans trying to grim up Equestria.

<p></p>You and me both.  I really do feel sorry for <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs">E Ps</a> at times.  They can be in positions of power but...they barely have powers.

It's my rough work for a Pegasus named Water Wings,  who if I have made right,  should resemble a penguin.  Particularly a Rockhopper.  He's got swimming googles,  a tail styled like a flipper,  and the colours of a penguin (although black is hard to work with).  Once terrified of the water,  his CM story saw him conquer that fear and become a powerful swimmer.  Like a penguin,  he 'flies' underwater.  Hence the choice of name.
<p></p>Thoughts?

<p></p>Same here.  I keep dark out of ponies as much as possible.

            Oh goodness,  earth ponies are weak because they don't have magic or flight? *rolls eyes*
<p></p>If there is anything I can compliment about earth ponies is this; they are strong and adaptable. Here's a saying my mom told to me when I was a colt; "If you tell an earth pony to cross a mountain,  they will make down in time for dinner. If you tell a pegasus to cross a mountain without them using their wings,  make sure they pack some food for the night."

            Personally I always thought the Earth Ponies had the best adventurers,  pioneers,  colonists,  and engineers in addition to their absolute agricultural monopoly,  also in recent years the merchant ogliarchy in Manehatten has begun to hijack economical importance from the old aristocratic Unicorn landowners.

<p></p>South Africa actually does have an afirmative action program,  but all it does is enrich the black political elite without benefiting the poor blacks who need it. Speaking of which,  Malaysia also has a bad affirmative action system that discriminates against the Chinese and basically non Malays.

            @Rainbow: I always considered it a given that Discord messed with the ponies so much they could no longer reasonably discern who was what race originally and made the old tribal discriminations meaningless when ma's forgotten whether she was originally a unicorn or a pegasus. Celestia and Luna capitalized on this to get some willing royals/powerful aristocrats on her side to create a unified government,  but too many ponies didn't want them to step down after their intended ruling term...

            Thanks,  guys (and girls?).  I guess the thing that bothered me the most was the fact that some of it was being based off a story that was said to be how things used to be,  and not how they currently are in Equestria.
<p></p>I think one of the things I really like about the show in canon is that the three pony types all live together and are equals,  like how they were in G1.  And just how forgiving and non-prejudiced pony society is in general (not to say there aren't individuals who can be cruel),  and that they're generally willing to give second chances and forgive those who show true repentance for their wrongdoings.  Even when the Ponyville citizens were being racist to Zecora at first,  it was more of a fear of the unknown (they didn't even know she was a zebra instead of just a weird kind of pony) and once they knew who she was,  she was accepted as an equal in their society (and trusted with the children on Nightmare Night).
<p></p>Even Diamond Tiara's main insult of choice is aimed at the lack of a cutie mark which is more like calling someone a baby than anything racist against Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo for not being Earth ponies.

            @Story: Huh,  I didn't think you knew about my country's dumb programmes.
<p></p>In this election,  the ruling coalition won less than they did in the last election,  and tried to characterize their heavier losses to a 'Chinese Tsunami'. Even though it was more likely that urban voters (Which do include a lot of Chinese) were just tired of their shit.
<p></p>I kid you not,  a major local Malay Language newspaper ran a headline that basically translated to "What More do the Chinese Want?". Partisan,  much?
