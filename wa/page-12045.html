            Storyteller,  nobody goes GAK GAK GAK.
<p></p>You're thinking of NAK NAK NAK.
<p></p>Also,  while Sombra had a woeful lack of characterization,  it's ineresting to extrapolate from what he left behind. Not being a truly cosmic-level threat like Nightmare Moon or Discord,  he was a Unicorn. What he did,  was he used magic in as many complex and cruel ways as he could. Knowing that,  like many things,  the key to the Empire's defense was the power of emotion,  he used magic to suppress the Crystal Ponies' memories and crush them under a tide of solemness.
<p></p>We know he was arrogant,  powerful,  and cemented his rule through fear. Which is why he hid the path to the Heart within his own throne room. As Twilight said,  he believed that no-one would <em>dare</em> enter his presence. He then set up the nightmare door to torture anyone who did make it into his room. Most likely,  Sombra's heart is so black that the door holds no threat for him. Then,  he set up an exhuasting flight of stairs,  capped off with a proximity trap with a teleportation spell woven into it.
<p></p>He was arrogant,  cruel,  brutal,  and <em>dangerously</em> smart. An <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Evil Sorcerer</a> dressed up in the garb of a king.
<p></p>If only we'd had more actual face-time with him,  instead of having to extrapolate from what he left behind.

            I think I liked this more than ACW. ACW was more exciting,  but the story in this was more interesting. Sombra was also definitely more interesting than Chrysalis aesthetically and planned ahead way more than I would have expected. The songs were great,  and Cadance and SA being back was great. I think the only complaint I have is that Rainbow was really annoying.<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> And Rainbow&lt;&gt;Fluttershy is totally continuing to be a thing.</div></span> <br> <br><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">And you explained why I liked Sombra better than I could.
