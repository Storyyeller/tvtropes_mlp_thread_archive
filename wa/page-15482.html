            True,  Bridle Gossip (and Dragonshy) told me that this show was something special.  Girly kids show or not,  it is a great watch.

Anyways I kind of discovered this My Little Pony through a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTube" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTube">YouTube</a> Poop video of the show and I wondered "what the hell is this shit?" so I decided to look online and sure enough I wikipedia that shit and I looked it up and found out it was a new cartoon for the franchise seeing as I had little to no knowledge of the My little pony franchise I had no idea that there would be a huge,  huge fanbase for this one show to be well liked among men. Heh,  men liking multi-coloured ponies huh? Times sure have changed.

            Several of my online friends were making a lot of references to it at the time,  and in particular one of the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbridgedSeries" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbridgedSeries">Abridged Series</a> I follow was making a lot of references,  so I finally decided to give it a shot. I watched the two-part pilot mostly thinking,  "okay,  this is pretty decent,  but I totally see where everything is going, " up until the end,  even rolling my eyes from time to time.
<p></p>The exact moment I switched from "eh,  it's fine, " to "okay,  this is awesome, " was when I got hit with a positive case of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a> by going from eye rolling at Twilight's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendshipSpeech" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendshipSpeech">Friendship Speech</a> to jaw dropping when it turned out that the titular "magic" of friendship was actually rainbow lasers.
<p></p>Ironically,  I now prefer the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> episodes to the epic adventure ones.
<p></p>And no,  we won't eat you alive for saying anything negative about the show. Provided,  of course,  that you're backing your opinion up rather than just trolling. :P
<p></p>^ Very nice. There's something slightly off about the mouth,  though... maybe a more concave line on the left side.

            @Starscream: Well,  it was something that I saw a lot of and really didn't pay it much mind. Even when I heard of all the guys who liked I just brushed it of thinking that even if they did like it I probably would not.
<p></p>For some reason I can't remember I encountered a bunch of positive descriptions that I didn't quite believe and decided I had to check it out and. . .that's that.
<p></p>As for saying negative things about the show,  I don't think you'll have much of a problem with that here. Though actual conversation about the show in the thread is pretty rare these days,  what with being between seasons and all.

            I was in a depressed state and found a lot of stuff on this site about it. So I figured it was at least good for some snark material and gave it a shot. I'd already watched G1 episodes when I was younger and remember liking them.
<p></p>And now that I've gone back after watching <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a>,  I'm now a general MLP fan and love just about all of it.

            I actually wanted this to happen (well something more dark/epic however). I wasn't MLP fan before but I wanted it to have some strong,  good show ,  because this show  was punchline to many people on internet,  lame,  for little girls.  I  wanted those people to feel silly if it turned out MLP (or some of it) was less sugary and better show,  I hoped  first cartoon was in that way (and it almost is). And at that time  MLPFIM started airing,   I discovered it (I saw sighs in many places before) and it's polarity months after it premiere).

            Okay good everybody is saying it's cool to rag on the show alright so no bloodsheds tonight. I won't be like Bret that Jules and Vincent shot in Pulp Fiction then. Okay here goes,  except Apple Bloom I hate the other Cutie Mark Crusaders for being bland and uninteresting characters.

            I'd agree they do share some traits. Though I'd put down to childish enthusiasm and I think they'll develop more as time goes by.
Heck we've got a great episode for Scoots and we're finally getting the explanation for her not being able to fly! Sweetie's the only Crusader who needs more development,  she hasn't had as much focus aside from being the cutest of the group and a good singer.

            My very first exposure to Ponies was a <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfWarcraft" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> guildmate showing me the Winter Wrap Up song. I immediately turned it off thinking it would just be terrible. Then one day the website <a class="urllink" href="http://wow.joystiq.com/">''WorldOfWarcraft'' Insider<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> showed this video.
<p></p><center><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="425" height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/egrlzkKa6O8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p></p>Apparently,  this show featured ponies kicking dragons in the face and bears <em>made of stars</em>. I went to TV Tropes,  I started watching clips,  then episodes,  and by the end of the week I was in a stream watching the then-newest episode "Green Isn't Your Color".
<p></p>Months later,  I found out I had a huge cache of G1 pony toys (they belonged to my sister). Apparently I was destined to become a brony.
<p></p>Also,  hi thread! Its been a while. I was at a family reunion. No,  barn raising and multi-colored fruit bats weren't involved.
