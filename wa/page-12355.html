            The book Twi reads in the very beginning looks like it's written in unicorn script,  while the Welcome Princess Celestia sign in <em>Swarm</em> was written in what looks to be English but is most likely Earth Pony script,  lol. The cutie mark crusaders had no trouble reading the Hearts and Hooves book,  suggesting they either know unicorn script or the Earth Pony Script is also used for books meant for wider audiences.
<p></p><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaringDo" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaringDo">Daring Do</a> fiction is probably primarily written in Earth Pony script to make it more accessible as Dashie could read it.
<p></p>Crystal Pony books were written in a language that at least Twi knew,  so it probably was written either in an older variant of Earth Pony script or something that predates Modern Equestrian but is still familiar to her.
<p></p>In fact I would be amused if Earth Pony script resembles Latin/English characters.
<p></p>@Kyler: point,  but I wouldn't be surprised if Modern Equestrian writing was like that. Dual-script writing makes sense if both writing systems were retained after the Three Tribes united. Pegasi signals would not become part of everyday writing,  but would become a common Signal Language used in clear communication.

            @Kegisak: You can care a lot and still be oblivious.  Being empathic and being observant aren't really related.  That and it's entirely possible that Babs was actively hiding the fact that she was being bullied,  given that the episode ends with her deciding to inform someone.

            Mmm... I suppose. Just seems like the comic was trying to posit her parents as being wholly uncaring.
<p></p>I mean,  I enjoy a little bit of black comedy as mch as the next guy,  but being depressing for the sake of being depressing is sort of the line for me.

            @Ace: Newspapers,  flyers and cakes are writen in the third script.
<p></p>And yes,  one of the scripts looks identical to English and the second looks rathe similar.
<p></p>My hypothesis is that all three scripts are taught as basic education.
<p></p>Also,  I think that the reason that everypony was able to communicate in the Crystal Empire was because of Cadance. She used a spell to make the entire city mutually intelligible to one another.
<p></p>It's something I'm sure she can do.

            Oh,  that one has an easier explanation: Kids tend to be more willing to talk to their siblings about an issue like this,  because a sibling tends to be closer to their level and therefore more able to help in a way the kids feels is real. I mean,  the standard adult line is something aking to 'ignore it',  right? Failing that the adult is going to go through acceptable channels,  which the kid doesn't recognize yet. An older sibling,  however,  is more likely to be directly protective in a channel the child recognizes - usually physical violencei n the case of boy,  but I can't speak for girls on that note. The adult's methods can also seem uncaring,  so the child is probably intimidated of talking to them - or if it's a parent,  they may believe that they SHOULD be able to ignore it,  and are thus ashamed.
<p></p>Um... so to put it as simply as I'd <em>originally</em> intended,  Babs's probably going to her sister because the sister is more helpful to her,  or she's too embarassed to tell her parents.

            @Sereg: given that pony technology doesn't seem to advance quickly,  it's entirely possible that the Modern language,  or a closely-related form,  was in use in the Crystal Empire.
<p></p>As for one of the script forms being like English,  yeah that gives me hope we can read it if we ever visit Equestria <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>I agree that they'd teach all three script forms in school,  it's practical and ensures most ponies should be able to read most books. I reckon more emphasis is placed on Earth Pony scripts and Pegasus signals,  since they're more commonly used.

            Luna didn't have to relearn the language after she came back,  she just had to learn to stop using antiquated forms of address. Being commoners,  the Crystal Ponies probably have no such issues.

            They're also discussing Babs's situation before she came to Sweet Apple Acres.
<p></p>@Lurker: she went back to a comfortable formal language that came up post-Discord at the time,  since she was still adjusting to the modern world.

<p></p>The point is that their language changed much more slowly than English did in the same time period.

            as to lack of lingual shift,  not only the less rapid development overall,  but It's sure to help having Celestia be around,  being able to keep the language from shifting to much just by being there and not changing the way she uses language.

<p></p>As I said,  I think that Cadance gave them the ability to speak Modern Equestrian.
<p></p>Of course,  my interpretation of Cadance is more powerful than that of many others. Then again,  there are many others who interpret her as even more powerful than I do.
<p></p>EDIT:Well,  we knew that language changes slower for them already. 1000 years ago,  English didn't even exist. Whereas Luna speaks Early Modern.
