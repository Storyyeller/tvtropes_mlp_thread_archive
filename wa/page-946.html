            I imagine Celestia and Luna don't have to concentrate on holding the sun or moon in place.  That would be a huge strain on them,  and it goes against the 'natural,  but guided' principles that seem to govern the rest of Equestria.

            Maybe they just get it started? Like they raise it and put it on its path,  then pull it down at the end of the day? 'cause if they were constantly using magic to keep moving it,  Celestia's horn would be glowing,  wouldn't it?

            I always figured it as a sort of toggling the "sun up/sun down" switch.  I mean,  we don't know if the sun <em>moves</em> across the sky like it does in real life,  so it might just be that once it's up it just stays there.
<p></p>As for the guards in the first episode,  Celestia is kinda,  you know,  gone,  so the Mayor is the highest present authority.

            Have we ever seen twilight or predawn in the show?  From the raising of the sun we saw in "Cutie Mark Chronicles",  the sun goes up pretty high when Celestia raises it,  though not unbelievably high for a sunrise.  It could still move across the sky,  is my point.

            There's also this weird habit that the mayor has of planning for people to appear from behind curtains,  even though they aren't there.
<p></p>The first time is excusable,  since Celestia was kidnapped without the mayor knowing (though the idea of her requesting that Celestia stand perfectly still bhind a curtain is certainly humorous)
<p></p>The second time (Applebuck Season) made NO sense whatsoever. Applejack didn't even turn up before they realized that she wasn't behind the curtain. Who did they think was back there,  and why didn't anyone check before the announcement started?
