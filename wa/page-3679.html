            Yeah,  pretty much. If he doesn't have it or know it he knows people who have it or know it: perhaps he has a friend who has something he needs that could 'fall off the back of a truck' or one who 'heard something while walking down the street'.
<p></p>He does things by the book,  but isn't afraid to get into grey areas: they're his sisters and they put themselves in danger at the drop of a hat,  so he can at least ensure they have what they need because they're family and he loves them (and if you tell them he said that last part,  he'll break your arms).

<p></p>Also,  I still don't see Derring using Darrin all that much. After raising them for so many years and not being allowed to indulge her adventurer side,  I imagine she'd want to get as far away from him and Daring as possible

            Well,  I was thinking Darrin could take that into account and set things up so a certain trader has <em>just</em> the right thing Derring needs,  but ensure it doesn't <em>look</em> like it's too perfect a coincidence.

            ^Yeah,  that guy.
<p></p>I also like the idea of Derring as a parent-surrogate.  That could reinforce her... not scorn,  but maybe underestimation?  Her patronizing attitude toward Daring,  anyway - she basically raised the girl,  so it's kind of silly to think she'd be a better explorer,  right?  That sort of thing.

            Maybe Darrin was an explorer in the past and was good at it (not as good as Daring,  Derring and his dad but still good),  and after a few high price artefacts he stopped exploring and used the cash to go into his current line of work.

She needed to spend more time looking after them,  and that made her resent them a little. (Daring was especially bad,  since she spent a lot of her childhood years exploring,  it kept reminding Derring of the life that these kids had denied her) As soon as they were old enough to look after themselves she severed all ties with them and left to go on an adventure.

            @Bad I saw Darrin refusing to be an adventurer as an act of defiance against his parents. Their obsession and choice of  lifestyle lead to them abandoning him and his sisters.
<p></p>He became a hgh ranking planner/official due to his life with Derring. Derring saw him and Daring as a burden that kept her grounded. He never wanted to be a burden ever again so sought to be as helpful as he possibly could.

<p></p>In a place where mythological monsters exist,  is letting a filly wander off into the woods or a cave unsupervised really a good idea (actually,  this happening in real life might not be so great either)?
