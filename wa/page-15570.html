            @Kegi,  about languages: Well,  it's no more a mutant language then French is,  and it's not as ugly of combination of Romantic and Germanic either (imo).
<p></p>I can't really say how closely related North Germanic languages are,  and I know that most of the other germanic languages are consider <em>west</em> germanic,  including english. For the record there was such a thing as East Germanic languages,  but they don't exist anymore. South Germanic languages is not a thing however (as far as I know).
<p></p>I know that Finnish was Uralic and so is Hungarian I believe. I did not know that they were related too Native American languages. Though most European languages are related in the sense that they all come from the Proto-Indo European language,  like most other things like religion.
<p></p>Too actually bring this into line with the threads subject,  it makes me wonder what the older pony languages sounded like. We can assume that Pegasi spoke some varitey(ies) of Greek. Given the cultures of the others my assumption is that the Earth Pony language was Germanic while the Unicorn language was possibly Slavic.

            @Mio: Finnish. Hungarian and Estonian are the only Uralic languages that are used as national languages,  I think.
<p></p>When I said they were related to native american languages,  I meant more in the sense that they were a series of very loosely-grouped tribal languages. In fact,  many of the groups that still speak the less-common uralic languages basically <em>are</em> native,  like the Norwegian Sami,  but in northern europe.
<p></p>Of course,  by that logic I supposed I'd have to refer to a lot of African language groups as being 'related',  but I just mean similar in that one aspect.
<p></p>Pony language is a pretty interesting concept,  really. If we take the old kingdom as the only pony society,  then it's likely all pony languages would likely be a variant of their language. However,  given that we've heard 'english' and 'french' (Which I regard as most <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">Translation Convention</a> for native pony languages) in the show,  which are from different linguistic families,  this is pretty unlikely.
<p></p>I like to consider that the old kingdom spread down to a mountain range on the souther edge of the continent,  where they ran into a pack of ponies travelling up,  and things kinda stopped there. So the 'western' pony languages are largely variants of Old Equestrian,  if they bothered to develop into new languages at all(North Passlandic,  the language in the north half of the mountin range the language advancement stopped,  is basically just Equestrian with an accent. South Passlandic is more akin to Scott's Gaelic),  wheras the east continent languages tend to be more varied,  due to the continent being divided by several channels and geological features,  allowing for more individual language growth. So we have Fancee(French),  Furhemian(German/Scandinavian),  Zohannonite(Arabic/Persian),  Mitaani(Chinese),  and roughly a half-dozen variant of the East Islands languages(Japanese meets Filipino meets Hawaiian). And of course old Trottinghamite(Norman) though it's largely evolved into an Equestrian dialect for the sake of a trade relationship.

            Well,  it <em>did</em> have a princess. But yes,  I was referring to whatever it was we saw in Hearth's Warming's Eve.Whatever one might call the collaboration of the tribes there.

Any,  government or society that comes from the union of three tribes would probably not purely consist of one of the older tribes government. I doubt the other two would allow it.
<p></p>I also find it doubtful that all three tribes shared the same language.

            The Pegasi tribe might have kept the authority,  while leaving the unicorns in charge of all knowledge and the Earth ponies the food for good reasons. Other than that,  I have no idea what to make of all this.

            Well,  they were able to communicate well enough to have a council,  though granted they were all political leaders so they would have had to learn most likely.
<p></p>But,  I'm not entirely sure we can count the different tribe societies as equal,  all things considered. I mean,  the earth ponies did most of the providing,  but didn't get much in return. Sure they got the sun and moon raised,  but the unicorns needed that too,  which means the unicorns aren't giving up much. The pegasi provided protection,  but in practice that probably means not razing the other tribes to the ground.
<p></p>I suppose at best you could say each race had the others hostage for their benefits,  in which case they're more like three seperate nations in close proximity.

            Depending on how active Everfree was at the time,  the pegasi may have still had their hooves full. Granted,  no Ponyville in close proximity,  but the princesses' castle had to come from somewhere,  so it may have been around (and not theirs yet). And then there was Discord (although a brute force army would likely have been entirely useless).

            @Kegi: That is likely the scenario it was in. And depending on how much you want to speculate the Earth Ponies were probably much more stable and possibly even controlling position then the play would have us think. Particularly over the Pegasi if their culture is as myopic as it seems.

            But in this case,  the Earth ponies provided the most service that all the ponies lived off of. making them the most importaint ponies during this period,  making Pinkie and Apple the most POWERFUL ones in the mane 6,  history-wise! (IMHO)

            That is true. Being the only source for resources gives them a lot of influence... assuming the pegasi aren't too stupid to realize they've got shit without the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs">E Ps</a> and try and take it by force.
