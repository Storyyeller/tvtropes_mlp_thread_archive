I get the feeling that if it would have a been a fair and square loss she would have taken it better.  And again,  it's as much her disappointment at failing to get money for the town as pride.  I can't say that pride had <em>no</em> factor in it,  but it's certainly not the only thing.

            AJ had no problem with losing to RD. The issue was she felt RD cheated,  it was the cheating part,  not the being beaten part that upset her.

            Of course,  AJ did overreact a bit; I would have assumed that she'd explain to her friends what happened,  and maybe tell them to keep a lid on it rather than keeping them in the dark entirely...
<p></p>Dangit I am so conflicted over this episode.  It has one or two serious issues,  but at the same time there's some really good characterization for AJ in there...

<p></p>Y'all know what's it like to be branded the best in town,  to say you'll ace the tourney this season? Yah? Well,  how about when you don't even ace a single contest? How about <em>them</em> apples?!
<p></p>To be fair,  I can relate to making the same mistake as AJ. I know that feel pony.

            No,  I'm leaving the fandom because most people <em>didn't</em> like the episode and I did. I mean,  I need to conform to the community I'm a part of,  and that's the TV Tropes community. But in real life,  most people dislike FIM period,  so then I'd need to conform to American society. Which up until now I've detested,  but now I see I have to follow their norms if I want to be happy. But then again,  I don't feel happy doing something I don't like. But you know,  there's some things you have to do,  no matter if you like it or not.

            @Born: I think the issue is more that rather than respecting AJ's desire for privacy,  they basically resorted to psychological torture.  I get that it's probably supposed to come across as a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">Cool and Unusual Punishment</a>,  but it's still kinda mean to do something like that to force somebody to tell you something they'd rather keep to themselves.
<p></p>@Applejack: You don't have to conform to anything like that.  If you like the episode,  you like it,  and that's that.  You don't have to bend to the majority to fit in.  That would be boring.  If you're capable of enjoying something that someone else can't,  more power to you.

            It felt like one of those stock plots to me. You know,  the standard 'why didn't you trust me to tell you when I was ready' thing. But they were going pretty hardcore on her. pretty much harassing her,  sicking <em>Pinkie</em> on her... It was just sort of poorly handled. Which is odd because AKR is usually a really good writer,  but I guess everyone has their off-days.
<p></p><em>but now I see I have to follow their norms if I want to be happy</em>
<p></p>No you don't. You need to do what you want to do if you want to be happy. It doesn't matter that someone doesn't share your opinion AJ,  people are allowed to think differently. You shouldn't feel like you have to leave just because you like something other people don't. There's plenty of room for both opinions.
<p></p>Beside,  majority rule actually seems to be in favour of the episode. Hell,  I'm not even in a very good mood today in general,  that may be colouring my perception. It might look better on a re-watch.

            ...I think I realized why I lurk more than I post here. I can't take this show that seriously and always just judge it based on how it entertains me. I feel out of place in most discussions. <br> <br>I really liked this episode,  I'd even put it in my top three season 2 episodes. According to Cherry Jubilee,  Applejack was awesome in the competition,  she had "Never saw a pony win so many ribbons in all my life" after all. And it's not like her not getting first place came out of nowhere; she messed up when practicing,  after all. On a related note,  I agree with whoever said that AJ handled it much better than the others. <br> <br>I think I enjoyed the stream's reaction to the Derpy scene more than I enjoyed the actual scene itself too. So much capslock DERPY. But,  can someone tell me what Derpy's first line was? I can't really understand her. <br> <br>I also...liked Pinkie in this episode. (sorry) I don't know why,  but her rambling was just more hilarious than usual. I've used annoyance as a weapon before,  it works surprisingly well. Full blown angry Pinkie was also really frightening. <br> <br>Also,  that dogpile on AJ at the end had to hurt...a lot.

            Yeah,  I don't hate it either.  And I'm actually rethinking my statement of about how weak it was.  It's not a bad episode,  by any stretch of the imagination.  There are one or two problems,  but there's a lot of good stuff in there.
<p></p>@Born: Yeah,  that word makes it sound way worse than it is,  but they still went to the point of trying to coerce her into talking about something that she didn't want to talk about.  And she was hardly ruining her life either,  she was just planning on working until she earned the money that she couldn't win.  Granted,  if she would have let them know they wouldn't have assumed that she was leaving for good...
