<p></p>Yeah,  that's part of why I gave that up.  About the same time as I started having trouble in my CS classes,  I started hearing horror stories of how the working conditions at some game studios are and I thought to myself,  "Maybe I should find something else."

            I'm 20 years old,  graduated Summa Cum Laude from a private university,  and have a Bachelor's degree... in anthropology. I don't have enough education in my field to get an anthropology job,  and despite having 2 years of retail experience working at my mom's antique shop,  I can't even get hired at f***ing Walmart. I have no idea why.
<p></p>I'm currently working a temp job at a lumber mill,  relatively harsh conditions (last week we scraped out the interior of a tree resin tank,  for example,  and today we climbed under a still-in-operation conveyor belt) for barely above minimum wage. Still,  it's something. And I have a good feeling that I'm gonna get this temporary part-time customer service job working for the state later this month. There were 12 candidates for 6 positions. Only part-time,  but still.

            I have a pony-related question for anyone who knows about the history of fan interpretations.  Where did the idea of Derpy being a mail carrier come from?  I read on Know Your Meme that it came before the episode Feeling Pinkie Keen and that it may have started with a fanfic called "A Friend for Derpy Hooves."  Is that THE story that started the idea,  or did it come from somewhere else?
<p></p>I was just curious because it's not something that necessarily would have come from something in the show itself,  such as the idea that she likes muffins (from the scene in Applebuck Season) or the idea of Dinky being her daughter (which comes from their similar coloring and them both being at Diamond Tiara's party).

            I think the fanon probably predates FPK. FPK was just coincidence. She isn't really a mailmare there either (she's never been in the show itself)

            Like a lot of bits of early fanon,  I think that was just something that was used in a fanfic that the fandom took and ran with.  Her appearance in FPK wasn't the origin,  but it probably helped solidify her role in people's minds.

            Rainbow: Derpy was portayed in fan interpretations as a mailmare quite early on. I used to lurk the old /co/ generals and she was already being drawn by the fanartists in the threads as such around the time of Dragonshy and Winter Wrap Up's first airings. I recall debates on how ditzy/random/dumb she might actually be in those times too,  I think most people settled for her being a bit ditzy and incredibly random.
<p></p>"Feeling Pinkie Keen" was one of the first episodes to finish production after the show staff became aware of the older fandom developing and the memes surrounding it - so that little addition to Twilight having various objects dropped on her was a sort of nod to Derpy's fanon developed persona(even if it isn't quite the same thing). Something they massively expanded on in season 2 - however the whole "The Last Roundup" business sort of stopped that all in it's tracks.
<p></p>It's sad really because I think Derpygate really brought an end up to heady-heights of the fandom for a bit. It caused so much fractions and in-fighting - it kind of changed the relationship between the fans and showrunners. Derpy is still my favourite pony in a lot of ways,  seems that way with a lot of other people too considering merch but...it's a little sad seeing she isn't even allowed to have a name and likely is discouraged from showing up in the show much going forward.

            This thread has some interesting early fanon if you go digging. I just have an interest in what the early fans thought of and what they guessed what would happen in season 2.

            Interestingly,  the whole Doctor Whooves and Derpy shipping came a little later towards the end of season 1,  nobody really paired them together early on. They just liked doodling her with muffins or occasionally playing/being motherly with Dinky Doo.
<p></p>Still makes me chuckle how everyone was really worried when Season 2's final episode was a 2 part wedding,  a lot of unimagantive people declaring it would be like a boring G3 story,  and they sure were not going to watch it. I think now it's one of the higher regarded episodes in the series,  and people came to adore Cadence despite the hatedom she had for months prior.

<p></p>That's because they managed to completely hide the real plot of the episode. Even when the clones trailer aired,  it wasn't clear what was going on,  though it did show that there would be something interesting happening.

            Hey everyone,  big news (personally).
<p></p>This morning,  mom was hearing some high pitched sounds from outside,  tried to find where it was coming from,  but had no luck cause the sounds stopped.
<p></p>Today when she got home from work she found it. It was a widdle baby kitty :3 so small it can fit in the palm of your hands. We don't know where its family is,  we're pretty sure it's a stray,  and she won't stop crying 3: poor widdle thing.
