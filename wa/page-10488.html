            Hey Applelight,  good to see you again.
<p></p>@Blue: Are you sure? Because I don't remember her ever making a statement about how long she would be gone.  In any case,  I still think they should have tried to convince her to come back through other means.  I'm not saying that they were wrong for wanting to get a reason out of her,  I just think they went about it the wrong way.

            No,  they should have started by explaining why she should come back "your family misses you,  the farm needs you to run properly,  ponies around town need you",  etc.  As is,  it comes across as "can you tell us why you're leaving" "no" "fine,  then we'll do this the hard way".  They never really try to convince her to come back; they focus all their efforts on trying to find out her reasoning. It's sort of the same problem that they had in MMDW; they just jump right to an extreme solution rather.

<p></p>I do have to admit that I can't condone Pinkie's actions towards Cranky...but I can't <em>hate</em> her for it,  because her heart is honestly in the right place.  Smile smile smile explains it all.  Pinkie lives only to make others happy...she just gets it wrong sometimes.
<p></p>@ TLRU
<p></p>It's tough,  but I agree with the casts actions towards AJ.  Though yeah,  it's another MMDW style issue.  The others should have tried a gentle approach first.
<p></p>And please sic Pinkie on me. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">

            I should clarify that I think ultimately they did the right thing,  I just feel like they should have made more of an effort to explain why they wanted her to come back so badly before trying to force it.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Exactly.  It just felt weird that they spent so much time trying to get inside her head when saying "Your family misses you,  and everybody in the town wants you to come back" probably would have solved the problem.  It's like the show actually dodged the problem: the whole reason they want AJ back is because the town is better off with her around,  and that's exactly the opposite of what AJ is doing.  If they would have explained that that's why they wanted her to come home,  it would have ended differently.
