            Question - how did this happen?
<p></p>As in - how did the show get revived? How did it get suddenly popular on the internet? How did I watch four episodes of it without feeling disdainful?
<p></p>And how did I admit that?

            They obviously have money,  seeing as Pinkie freaked about Glinda stealing an Apple. I tend to think it's a kind of credit system,  since the ponies generally don't have a very easy way of carrying cash. Maybe there's a Money Magic pony family who handles all accounts in Eguestria. Say,  Twilight Sparkle does some farm work with Apple Jack. She earn 5 PB and hour. She tells Golden Pocket pony of Ponyville who psychically relays the info to headquarters. Lat,  Twilight wants to vbuy a soda at the Sweet Shop. Her credit is there when she needs it.
<p></p>Maybe it's part of spikes job to "Fire transfer" the receipts to Hq?  We see spike helping the girls but he obviously has other jobs—he was working in the post office one episode,  which is why a bunch of scrolls landed on Celestia in that episode (spike sneezed).

            I wonder if Cloudsdale is the only place that specializes in making weather related stuff. If it is,  then there must a be high demand for cloud exports.
<p></p>On a related note,  I wonder what sort of income Fluttershy makes or if she is on some kind of welfare program. Also,  I wonder how people manage to pay Pinkie Pie fast enough for her to throw such garish parties at the drop of a hat. Catering must be in high demand.

            Actually,  I realize that one of the things I like about this show (among other things) is the background music. Like the one in the first half of Show Stoppers.
<p></p>^ I think Fluttershy is a warden of sorts. Animals don't take care of themselves (unless you're in the Everfree Forest).

            I think Fluttershy might have a symbiotic sort of relationship with the animals,  as in they help her out with food in exchange for taking care of them. Either that or she's just self reliant; she's got a chicken coop after all,  so it's not a stretch to imagine her having a garden.
<p></p>As for Pinkie,  I remember reading somewhere that she was a live-in helper at the Cake's sweet shop,  so I think the party thing is more of a hobby than a job,  Like Dash's racing.

            It's either that,  or someone's paying Fluttershy for her services. When you have to run the entire ecosystem manually,  you'll want to make sure your staff is well-fed.

            I'd imagine that since Fluttershy is pretty much the <em>only</em> one we see taking care of animals,  and since some of the animals she deals with are pretty big,  she makes enough to feed herself and anything that happens to stop by.  If for no other reason than in case a stray manticore finds its way into town.
<p></p>Speaking of giant animals,  where was Fluttershy when the Ursa Minor showed up?  (Other than,  you know,  out of the way so that Twilight could be the one to deal with it.)

            Fluttershy is unique amongst Pegasi as she likes to stay close to the ground. Also,  I do recall one episode where she takes care of Rarity's cat,  so she probably makes some money grooming other ponies' pets.

            Well,  I didn't see her pay for it,  and there was only the one scene where money was shown,  which I had forgotten about. I was kind of operating under the (apparently false) idea that the economy was entirely service based - a Ponies life is,  ultimately,  defined by their cutie mark,  and so they go through it doing what they love most. Since this isn't always profitable,  the ponies in charge of farming just kinda hand out food,  and same goes for other goods and services. Ponies allow what they make or do to be taken for free under the assumption that it will be repaid later. It's not a really feasible system,  with Ponies like pierce around,  but it is a kids show.
