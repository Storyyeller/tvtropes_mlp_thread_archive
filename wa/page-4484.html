            Well,  I'm in a bit of a quandary.  I just recieved an e-mail from my school saying they have a position open for me to start as soon as I want.  I wasn't expecting to get in until next year,  and I have less than half of the money saved that I was planning on having.  I'm getting a loan,  but it doesn't quite cover tuition,  and I still need to live off of what I save and what my parents are willing to lend me.  I might be able to make it with the money I have now,  but it'll be a real close call and not even close to comfortable.  On the other hand,  I'm getting old,  and I don't want to be thirty and just starting my career,  which will happen if I wait.  My parents are pushing me to start now,  but honestly,  this really scares me.

            Thread hopping from earlier,  nope,  not an artist myself. Can't draw. Which is a shame,  cause I'd like to do one of them ask tumblrs,  but I'd need to find/coordinate with an artist.

            CDRW,  I'd say go ahead with the school's offer.  Yes,  it may not be comfortable,  but you've been presented with an opportunity.  Personally I think it's a little silly if you don't take it.  On the other hand,  you should only move forward if you are absolutely certain it is what you want.  If your parents are willing to help you out,  so much the better.

I had to make sure of that because it's a risky profession anyways.  But I don't want to risk being forced out of school in my last year because I'm a couple thousand dollars short.  I might be able to get summer jobs while I'm in school to make up the possible difference though.

<p></p>As for chubby Fluttershy... don't forget,  she was once a model. There are exceptions,  but most models tend to be on the skinny side. Plus,  there are people who have pretty high metabolisms and don't eat too much who can stay really skinny.

            Above all,  schools <em>want</em> you to attend them. I'm sure they have had several students in a similar situation to you,  so they probably have the best advice for you in that regard. If they really want you like you say they do,  they'll try to hook you up with as much financial aid as possible.

In fact,  the reason I don't like them is a bit convoluted and stupid anyway. If I have any quirk in this thread,  that would be it.

            @ Lurker:  At a normal school,  that would almost certainly be the case.  However,  mine is a trade school,  which means it's unacredited,  which means no financial aid.  I'm lucky I was able to get a crappy variable interest loan (which I have to make payments on <em>while</em> I'm in school!) that doesn't fully cover tuition.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> That's a possibility.  The market here is saturated,  but I know other places really need help.  I was practically offered a job just from doing the research to find out if it's a viable profession.  If I could do that for a summer it would be great.

            Twi would probably be a little chubby,  I mean she sits in all day studying. If she isn't' exercising then she eats really really well or her metabolism is perfect.
<p></p>It's subtle but my plans were always to make her slightly portly but moderation is always difficult.
