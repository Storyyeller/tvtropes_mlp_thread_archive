            The guy is basically a reality warper,  how hard could magic be for him?
<p></p>I'm kind of glad that he's not serious,  to be honest. If he turned out to be anything close to a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monster</a> I'd have been royally pissed. Still,  there's plenty of potential for him to be incredibly freaking scary - he seems like he's only a few steps away from being a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a>. That almost seems like something they'd do,  create a villain that's fun for the kids,  but becomes terrifying once you think about it a little bit harder.

            He definitely seems to see everything as a game. Someone like him has the potential to be chatostrophically dangerous. Especially since it seems he can do ANYTHING. Makes you wonder why Celestia entrusted this job to the cast unless she herself was incapacitated by him. Maybe she thought they'd be somewhat safe because Discod likes to put everything in the context of a game,  meaning he won't insta-nuke them with his powers. (which I'm sure he could)
<p></p>And if that stained glass window depicting him with the marionette strings is any indication,  he's probably sadistic as well. Taking pleasure from controlling the lives of unsuspecting ponies.
<p></p>Some people are already saying that he's not evil. I disagree,  this guy has the potential to be the most evil MLP antagonist so far (not to mention the strongest) He strikes me as being <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvillyAffable" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvillyAffable">Evilly Affable</a>

            Yeah,  I'm seriously wondering what happens when the ponies win.  Does he just let them take the elements back and defeat him,  or does he start blatantly cheating?  And if he decides to get serious how are they supposed to beat him?

            ^^Oh,  definitely.  Celestia and Luna sealed him for a <em>reason</em> - I mean,  come on.  It took us two posts to go from 'he likes to play games' to 'what happens when he loses'?
<p></p>As for why the Princesses aren't helping... they may not be able to.  Luna might not be as powerful as she was a thousand years ago yet,  or she might be away from Canterlot; it took the both of them to get Discord last time (as shown in the glass windows),  so Celestia alone probably can't handle him.
<p></p>^Well,  that was a big part of the pilot. =)

Sort of a "if you win,  I release them,  you lose,  and you get sealed too" or something like that.
<p></p>I really don't think we can judge his whole character based on this clip; we don't have enough context to see what happened to set up this situation.
<p></p>Currently he seems kinda goofy,  but depending on what happens before and after this,  he could easily become really creepy.  Considering he can poof away their wings and horns without any effort,  it implies that he's pretty damn powerful.  Which also makes the goofiness scarier; if he were serious it implies that he could be reasoned with.  If he does everything for the lulz,  there's really nothing you can do but hope you can get rid of him before you get caught in the crossfire.
<p></p>In any case,  he looks really entertaining.  I look forward to the episode.

            Now I'm imagining Discord thinking of his imprisonment as some kind of game. Maybe after being beaten by Celestia and Luna. He said something like: "Ok new game. You two seal me away,  and we all guess how long it's gonna take for me to break out. Whoever's guess comes closest wins." Celestia and Luna callously say "Forever" Discord says "1067 years"
<p></p>Cue him escaping and blasting Celestia away as punishment for "losing" the game. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">

            The problem I have with a Q-like Discord is that he may decide to simply revert everything to its original state after messing around. To the ponies it would be the best outcome but to fans it would be the worst kind of sucker punch as it would make the entire two-parter meaningless.
