            <div class="quoteblock">Why can't we ever discuss the actual episodes? </div>
<p></p>We kinda do.  Problem with having just one Pony thread is that all the discussion about the minutinae of Ponykind tends to get lost behind all the creepy talk and going on about arbitrary background ponies you just happened to give a name to.
<p></p>Speaking of which,  is there already a name for that white pegasus that flies by in the season two intro?  If not,  I opt to call her "Crest Complete."
<p></p>Anyway,  I was honestly about to post a "Season Two so far" entry in my blog,  which woulda been capsule reviews of the episodes currently aired followed by thoughts and expectations,  but honestly it didn't seem like blog-worthy material.  Here it is though,  in case ya want something else to talk about:
<p></p>EPISODE CAPSULE REVIEWS
<p></p><em>Return of Harmony pts 1 and 2</em> - [Redacted since you all know what I have to say]
<p></p><em>Lesson Zero</em> - The best episode of the season so far.
<p></p><em>Luna Eclipsed</em> - WE ROYALLY DECREE THAT THIS ALSO BE THE BEST EPISODE OF THE SEASON SO FAR!
<p></p><em>Sisterhooves Social</em> - This was one of those episodes that was extremely cute (lots of Sweetie Belle d'awww) but otherwise nothing remarkable.  Also turned people into wet pony lovers.  I hope there's nothing creepy in that.
<p></p><em>The Cutie Pox</em> - I would call it one of the best,  but honestly it was one of those "I liked it once,  but then couldn't do it again" kinda deals for me.  Gotta love the fleur-de-lis though.
<p></p><em>May the Best Pet Win</em> - I honestly didn't think this ep was that special,  except for some cute moments.  The song was good but not "At the Gala" or "Cutie Mark Crusaders theme" good.
<p></p><em>The Mysterious Mare-do-Well</em> - This episode just didn't leave an impression on me at all.  I didn't like it,  I didn't hate it.  It simply exists.
<p></p>The hopes and expectations part:  I kinda feel like the season so far has fired its best and worst shots already,  and now its just emptying the barrel.  Though,  a gun fired randomly can still hit a target,  and the season has eighteen episodes left to pull off something amazing,  but it still has its work cut out for it if it wants to top "Lesson Zero."
<p></p>So,  non-humanized Pinkie in a bra,  yay or nay?  (... Actually,  I can't see how there's anything controversial about animals in human clothes,  no matter what the assumed implications,  so whatever).

            Could be... kind of funny,  so long as she doesn't wear it over he actual breasts. I don't know why,  but that weird me out. Draws more attention to it,  I guess. Having her wear it over her chest just seems like it would be funny,  especially if she didn't know what it was.
<p></p>I honestly don't think Lesson zero was that spectacular. No accounting for tastes I guess,  but on the whole it was just okay for me.

            I don't think she was <em>irritating</em>. I still enjoyed the episode,  but it just felt like it was trying too hard. Like,  the expressions felt forced near the end. All of the other breakdowns had nice,  subtle and believable expressions,  but Twilight's? Bitch was straight-up nuts. It just gave it a bit of a shot in the foot,  for me.

            "Lesson Zero" wasn't spectacular,  but it was entertainingly funny/creepy.  Not everything has to be a blowout.
<p></p>The only low episodes for me in S2 so far have been "The Cutie Pox" (slow second act dragged on too long) and "The Mysterious Mare Do Well" (the writing seems off).  Everything else has been great in my book,  but even the worst of S2 is still better than the worst of S1 (probably "Over a Barrel" for me).

            I thought May The Best Pet Win was great,  personally.
<p></p>The only genuinely unimpressive episode thus far this season for me is Mare Do Well,  but it's no worse than Feeling Pinkie Keen (I actually quite like Over a Barrel,  I'm not sure why so many bronies have a low opinion of that one) in that regard and they both have a few redeeming qualities. Every season has to have a "worst" episode,  after all.

            I don't think I'd file "The Mysterious Mare-Do-Well" under my favorites,  maybe I'll re-watch it at some point and see if it does.
<p></p>It alluded to "Feeling Pinkie Keen",  too. Funny how it seems to be shaping up to be like Rainbow's version of that,  in my mind. And initially the "let's pat ourselves on the back" scene pissed me off so bad,  because everything out of their mouths smacked of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a> (though in retrospect,  it was probably purposeful,  and it was already intended in part to put things in perspective for Rainbow).

            I saw that scene as less the cast patting themselves on the back and more them going "hint hint,  nudge nudge" at Rainbow.  They wanted her to figure it out at that point and learn the lesson already,  the fact that she overreacted to it and ran off to try and unmask the Mare do Well is all on her.

The posters and the music are where the BTAS stuff comes in. I thought it was all very cool.
<p></p>I think if they'd come clean once they saw the reaction Rainbow was having to it and it was obvious the MMDW wasn't having the intended effect,  I'd have much fewer problems with the scene. As it is,  the fact that she got so distressed over it and then they laughed at her for it is what makes it seem like they completely forgot what happened in Lesson Zero.
<p></p>I prefer <em>not</em> to think that her reacting like that was intentional and part of the plan,  because then it goes from them just trying to help their friend in an (imo) suspect way to them really just being complete bitches.

<p></p>They failed to notice her ego only escalated instead of deflating.
<p></p>That episode would have been handled much much better if the aesop would have been delivered to the whole mane cast,  part of what makes Lesson Zero so powerful.

As it is,  it's basically as if they'd come across Pinkie in Party of One (or Twilight in Lesson Zero) then actively made the problem worse. And as I said,  I prefer not to think it was their intention for Rainbow to wind up feeling lonely and depressed on her own <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalRaincloud" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalRaincloud">Personal Raincloud</a>,  any more than it was their intention for brushing Twilight's panic attack off to cause her to send Ponyville into chaos over a doll.
<p></p>Basically,  nobody comes out of this episode looking very good in my eyes. That's why I have a low opinion of it.

            I just don't see the problem people had with enciting RD's breakdown. It's not like she didn't bring it on herself by reacting the way she did.
<p></p>Her breakdown in this ep was peanuts... PEANUTS compared to what would've happened had she gone on unopposed. You thought she was addicted to praise NOW,  well imagine if a similar incident (with a pony who WASN'T her closest friends) happened somewhere down the line instead.
