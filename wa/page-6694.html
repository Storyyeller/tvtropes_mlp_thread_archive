<p></p>It's the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonBluth" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonBluth">Don Bluth</a> effect. Nearly all his really good movies had a lot of parts taht were down right terrifying,  but everyone,  even kids,  loved them becuase the all ended happiliy. Think it was <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNostalgiaChick" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNostalgiaChick">The Nostalgia Chick</a> that brought it up.
<p></p>Basicly kids are not as easily frightened of this stuff as most overprotective people assume,  plus a good deal of the NMF is stuff that is only really scary when you stop to think about it far far more then most kids would.

That was probably my favorite moment of the whole two-parter.

            You know,  one thing I really love about this show is how much of it makes <em>sense</em> when you stop to think about it. Like the Elements,  and what each of the six attributes means beyond the one-word descriptions given (and in the case of Magic,  stuff that is entirely inferred which turns out to be dead-on).
<p></p>Or,  in today's case,  the repeated examples of how unity is a powerful force all its own. It's been channeled in many different ways: whether that be a fiery heart born of unity between the three races,  six gemstones meant to hold the aspects of unity between all people,  or,  in today's episode,  the raw,  revitalizing power of unity between two people who want to give their lives to each other.
<p></p>Unity is power. And it's funny. So far,  we've seen a number of threats,  past and present. We've seen one who rejected the idea of unity as a lie. We saw a creature who sought to pervert the very tenets of unity. We flashed back to a horde of creatures who sought to destroy it to feed on its absence. And our newest villain is one who seeks to steal that power for herself.
<p></p>I just really love the way the themes just weave together.

            Had a thought earlier regarding the changing of the sisters' shifts.
<p></p>It seems that the way it works is that,  since Canterlot was threatened,  they would need to split up to check for internal and external possibilities. During a certain time of day,  the sister associated with it would stay and look for internal threats to Canterlot while the other would fly out and look for external threats.
<p></p>Given Luna's initial entrance,  that would be the most logical reason for why she wasn't present for the battle with the Queen - she was too busy looking for a threat that already attacked.

            Perhaps the bit where,  as Luna took over the telescope shift,  she told Celestia to rest?
<p></p>The whole reason she was flying in from the outside is that she still has her night-raising duties to tend to. I very much doubt that the bubble shield is designed to allow any magic to go through it,  from the inside <em>or</em> the outside.

<p></p>Anyway unless Changelings have a viable soul they can't pretend to be <em>me</em>,  just my flesh chassis.
<p></p>Luna's other role is in covert ops,  so she's usually in the background with her stealthy night guard. Moon ninja.

            Still going with They simply decided they wouldn't both be in Canterlot together until the threat was determined,  or passed that way if something powerful or sneaky enough did attack,  at least one Princess would be free to protect the rest of Equestria.

            also @ Enlong YES YES,  that is perfect. And really it is one of the best things about this show,  yes you can just watch it for the simple stuff,  just enjoy it as it comes and be happy,  but if you want to look deeper and really analyze it,  it STILL stands up and gets even better.

            Sleep <em>is</em> rest.
<p></p>But not <em>all</em> rest is sleep.
<p></p>But I think we can agree that flying around and patrolling the outer areas also does not equal rest.
<p></p>edit: oh,  you think that the princess that wasn't actively guarding was resting up somewhere outside the city? That could work. Though,  didn't Celestia walk into the tower when Luna took over the telescope shift?
