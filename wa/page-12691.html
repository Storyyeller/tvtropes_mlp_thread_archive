Even better. Season Three,  Episode 7: Rainbow Dash is in Wonderbolts training camp,  on the cusp of achieving her dreams—and she’s willing to throw it away if becoming a Wonderbolt requires her to betray her friends.

            Failed is a bit too strong a word.  Let's say wasn't at her best as a commander.
<p></p>So Spitfire wasn't at her best because she should've noted that Lightning Dust was being too reckless.  She should've done something at around the time of the obstacle course when all the other teams got knocked into the clouds.

            She had assumed that the other teams wiped out on their own. She even said so herself when RD and LD landed. Considering all of the stuff in the course,  it'd be impossible to see exactly what happened from the ground to begin with.

            @Perpetual Lurker  Because of her assumption it allowed the situation to escalate.  She could've at least tried to have the other instructors right there running the course as well or in positions where they could see things clearly.

            Again,  how in the hell is she supposed to know when RD got to her before any other pony.
<p></p>and once AGAIN the tornado in and of itself wasn't the issue,  it was a mistake yes. but the issue was LD's not giving a fuck about nearly killing other ponies.
<p></p>We saw the observes getting scatered by the tornado,  and it's not hard to imagine any offical ponies around were checking with the Mane 5 making sure that they were okay and un hamred as a first priority,  while RD went to Spitfire.

            I really can't count it a personal failure on Spitfire's account that she wasn't aware of the tornado thing.  There were literally only about two minutes between the accident and her finding out about it.  Given that this is a world without any practical sort of instant communication,  I can't really blame her for not knowing literally within minutes of the incident.  I think you <em>can</em> make a case that the subordinates should have been quicker to respond,  but that's a failure on their part,  not Spitfire's.  No matter how good a leader is,  they can't <em>force</em> their subordinates to be competent.  I think she did just about as well as she could have in that situation.  As soon as she was aware of the situation she addressed it in an equitable fashion.
<p></p>Sure in an ideal world she'd know exactly what was going on everywhere in the academy,  but she's only one pony.  It's impossible for her to be able to deal with everything that goes on.  She's not perfect.

            and like I said,  it's entirly possible the subordinates were sinply making sure that the other Mane 6 were alright and didn't need medical attention first,  plus how are they supposed to take out the tornado that fast? there was no time to react between it getting out of hoof,  the ballon appearing in it's path and the crash

            What Seraphem said.  Possibly injured civilians take priority.  <em>Then</em>,  they can find who's responsible.

            Speaking of the civilians,  that whole bit where they catch the mane six and the care package was just adorable. Cloudchaser was not amused when she noticed Fluttershy had wings. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            Yeah,  I mean,  let's translate this into a real world scenario.  Imagine that you had two boot camp recruits doing a vehicular exercise with a humvee or jeep or something.  The one driving is being a dick and crashes into a bus with the other recruit's friends in it.  The other recruit jumps out,  makes sure her friends are okay,  and as soon as she knows they are goes directly to her instructor to inform them of what happened.  Even in a world where we <em>have</em> cellphones and whatnot,  it wouldn't surprise me if the superior hadn't heard yet,  and in Equestria there is no such thing.
<p></p>Anyone on the scene would almost certainly be tending to the crash to make sure there were no casualties.
