<p></p>@ CDRW so what I'm assuming is happening is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Celestia purified Luna 1000 years ago,  but still banished her,  then went Tyrantlestia,  or at least more so then Cannonlestia,  when Luna came back she saw how Celestia was acting and was trying to overtrough her,  which awakened Discord.

            @ginger Suki gets a cute moment with Appa in "Appa's Lost Days". The Kyoshi play a much bigger role in Seasons 2 and 3.

            @ Seraphem: That's a good guess.  That's not what happens,  but you've hit decently close to the mark.

<p></p>Well I've been pretty free with the ATLA spoilers. The only thing I intentionally tried to avoid spoiling was the season 2 final. But  other people might not like spoilers,  so as long as Crowlover is watching PMMM,  I'm not going to spoil it.

            yeah the Aesop was kinda overdone,  but at least with the Kyoshi episode it 1. wasn't the entire plot of the episode. 2.Has some major connections later on to the rest of the series 3. Sokka actaully learned a lesson there.
<p></p>where as in TGD,  1.Hammering the Aesop into you is the only point of every scene once the basic premise shows up,  2. it has NOTHING to do with anything in the rest of the series 3. None of the main characters learned anything,  the conflict was ended by Aang lying his arrow off with the dumbest story possible,  and the whole Kattara/Sokka conflict was about flaws that only showed up for this episode then disappeared.

            I never really liked Yue.  There was just way too much character arc crammed into only two episodes,  and it didn't really work.

            Let me think...I was familiar with the fact that a lot of dudes where into the show. Then I had a chat with this high ranking dude in my guild named Brony. He said some stuff about the show,  so I decided to watch. Luna Eclipsed was my first episode. Had little clue who the characters where but I learned.
