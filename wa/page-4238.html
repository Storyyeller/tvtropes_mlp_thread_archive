            @Order villian Since I brought it up,  I feel a bit responsible for this.
<p></p>He would probably appear as a plain,  monotone earth pony. Twilight might have summoned him at first,  not realizing the extent of his powers. However,  after he dispatches Celestia and Luna for "upsetting the balance of power, " the Mane 6 realize they need to stop him.
<p></p>In my headcanon,  harmony is the perfect balance between order and chaos. Not predictable,  but not insanity either.

            @Ginger: Yeah,  it'd be cool,  but... it doesn't really fit,  you know? All of the real villains so far have been really in-your-face,  even the minor antagonists. Suddenly introducing a villain that <em>only</em> works through other ponies,  or even just through processes designed to screw the girls over,  would feel sort of awkward in comparison.

            @kegi I see him as a cold,  emotionless guy who just does it because it's all he can do. He'd kill a thousand ponies for the sake of organization.
<p></p>...Although I doubt we're thinking the same thing on this.
<p></p>@Apple I usually prefer an anti-Mane 6 for that. Flim Flams (lying),  Blueblood (selfishness),  Gilda (betrayal),  and Trixie (magic). Not sure who to use for kindness and laughter,  though.

            Back from dog walk.  Had to stop my dog from trying to murder 2 other dogs,  3 cars,  and a little girl (jk,  on that one,  before anyone freaks out,  I just had to convince her that trying to pet my dog was a bad idea)
<p></p>So: Deathnote discussion.
<p></p>@L Mage: That pony L would be a great pic if for one thing: it gave L bishie eyes.  L has dead fish eyes,  they're pretty much his most noticeable feature.  Also,  of course no one ever found Naomi's body.  Naomi was really smart,  and Light commanded her too <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill herself in such a way that <em>no one would ever find her body.</em></span>
<p></p>Light would kill both Princesses (simply for being powerful enough to stand against him),  all of the Element Holders (once they rose up against him),  so basically the entire main cast,  minus Spike.
<p></p>Now about this so called "Order" villain,  it sounds interesting but it would need some kind of flaw to keep it from winning outright.  Discord only lost because he enjoyed toying with his enemies,  but an Order type villain shouldn't have that problem.  Maybe if it simply couldn't understand ponies enough to predict their actions?

<p></p>I <strong>love</strong> that.

            @Ginger: Most of it probably comes from the fact that I'm running on 2 hours of sleep,  so I'm less inclined to be gracious than normal. Another hefty part of it is that I tend to have a fairly low opinion of consumers by default,  as a sort of defense mechanism against the sort of products I know I'm going to have to work on,  and I know people are going to buy regardless of how generic and banal it will be. I <em>want</em> to employ <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllViewersAreGeniuses" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllViewersAreGeniuses">All Viewers Are Geniuses</a>,  but if I do on too large of a scale I know I'll just be disappointed. So if I ever want to I do it on a niche scale,  and the rest of the time I expect the worst so I'll be pleasantly surprised.
<p></p>The final section is probably just that I seem to have a knack for reading and predicting people,  and I notice that there are certain things that just don't sit well. Moral ambiguity is one of them. People don't like to be 'wrong',  and they don't like rooting for the bad guy because of it.
<p></p>I know I should try not to sound so dismissive,  and that really isn't my intention. it's just one of those things that sort of depresses me,  and I suppose lethargic fatalism can seem condescending.

            @Blue I think he'd have an AI type weakness. Usually,  AI villains (like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GLaDOS" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GLaDOS">GLaDOS</a>) overload if they're given a paradox. So Order has to organize everything he sees. The Mane 6 would have to find something that would take him a long time,  however,  because he's incredibly efficient. If they wrecked Twilight's library,  he could fix it before they got all the elements ready.

            A Discord opposite called Order. Discord,  spirit of Chaos,  madman in it for the fun.
<p></p>Order... Perhaps another spirit,  something summoned or released? Perhaps a being of stone,  something whose neutral form is a stone block,  a perfect cube,  but can shapeshift as well. Perhaps an aura that brings logic upon the world and she can even turn off Pinkie's comedy abilities.
