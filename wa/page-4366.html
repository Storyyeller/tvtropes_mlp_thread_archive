            well,  I really don't see money being that big a deal in Equestria,  sure the richer ones get a bit better stuff and more goodies,  but I really really don't think ANY pony goes without at least the basics,  that being said. yeah rarity probably has the biggest bank account,  one i'm more ???? about there income source is Fluttershy,  rest have SOME means you can see.

            @Ginger:  I think Twilight would have the lowest; she's essentially a special case college student.  She was given use of the library for free so she'd have a place to live in Ponyville,  so she probably doesn't get paid much to run it.
<p></p>Pinkie seems like a part-time worker,  with the added benefit of being given a place to stay by her employers.  She gets all of her stuff either through Pinkie Powers or through favors from her many,  many friends.
<p></p>Applejack,  unfortunately,  doesn't seem to be doing very well,  probably on account of the fact that they don't have enough workers for the farm and that there have been numerous catastrophes that have damaged their crops.
<p></p>Rainbow Dash is,  I <em>think, </em> leader of the Weather Team,  so she probably gets paid decent,  a normal sort of managerial salary.
<p></p>Rarity probably makes the most money but most of it goes right back into her business.
<p></p>Fluttershy seems to be mostly self-sustaining,  growing her own food and such.  Probably gets paid a little to help people pets.

            Offhand I'd say Fluttershy probably doesn't earn too much,  unless she does veterinary work that we don't see. She seems sort of self-sufficient,  no real need for actual money.
<p></p>And like I said,  Pinkie's pay probably goes immediately to her lodgings and food. Hell,  she's probably got an allowance,  or something.

            I thought the Cakes let Pinkie stay in their spare room for free.  They seem to treat her like a daughter,  I don't see them charging her rent.
<p></p>Fluttershy probably still has a bunch of money left over from when she was a model.

            Hmmm,  I kinda like thinking that along with her pay from the cakes,  she also makes money as ponyvilles party planner,  not that she'd ever require a pony to pay for a party,  but most ponies that she throws one for help out and least cover the material costs. Really,  I just can't beleive that a pony that really needed some help wouldn't be taking care of for abit...at least as long as they didn't abuse it.

            @Bluespade: I don't know about AJ; I think she probably makes just as much if not more than Rarity,  it just goes back into the farm.  I mean,  stuff like the Zap Apples and Cider must be raking in a huge amount of cash.
<p></p>But yeah,  overall I don't really see any of them being <em>poor</em>.  Yeah,  Twilight is a student,  but given who her teacher is,  she definitely has a full-ride scholarship and doesn't have to pay for her house,  which probably means that while she doesn't get paid much,  she likely has far fewer expenses.
<p></p>Pinkie probably doesn't make much either; I wouldn't be surprised at all if the Cakes have to dock her pay on a regular basis because she keeps eating stuff.
<p></p>Not sure about Fluttershy,  though.

            @Apple I don't see why someone with a slender body type couldn't pull off feats of impressive strength,  especially if they tend to be acrobatic in nature.

            let's see two lists,  most Income,  and most expenses as I see them
<p></p>income
<p></p><ul><li>Rarity
</li><li>AJ
</li><li>RD
</li><li>Pinkie
</li><li>Twi
</li><li>Fluttershy
</li></ul><p></p>Expenses
<p></p><ul><li>AJ
</li><li>Rarity
</li><li>Pinkie
</li><li>RD (mostly of the Wonderbolt paraphernalia variety)
</li><li>Twi
</li><li>Fluttershy
</li></ul><p></p>so yeah most of the ones with the lower incomes,  also would be the ones that need money the least.

            @ applelight,  i really don't think so,  it's a bit to thin to really convey an amazonian image for me,  I look at Fluer and see super-model body,  tall but not imposing.

            I think Fluttershy is pretty self-sustaining. Probably doesn't earn much,  unless she takes care of other people's pets as someone else guessed.

<p></p>@Apple: About Fleur's fighting style? I think she's pretty dainty,  but not a really heavy hitter sort of fighting style. Maybe like....I dunno,  ninjaish. Light strikes,  speedy movements.

            @Blue I think it's what seraph said. She makes a lot of money,  but it always seems to go back into the farm.
<p></p>Then how does Fluttershy pay for her house?

<p></p>What do you mean? Any sufficiently active thread goes off topic a lot,  especially when it's been a while since there was anything to talk about. Just look at the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassEffect3" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a> thread.
<p></p>Also,  Fluttershy does the bunny census,  so maybe she gets paid for that.

<p></p>It's just,  well,  I'm sort of a neatfreak. Sorry if it came off as forceful,  but I just enjoy nice,  clean,  organized discussions. I don't mind this,  really,  but it would be better.
