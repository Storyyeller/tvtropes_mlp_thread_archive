            I don't think approaching this development from a skeptical point of view is entirely unreasonable. Other works that were designed to appeal to the demographic this is aimed at are not exactly known for there quality.

            <div class="quoteblock">Just because they change some of the elements of the show doesn't mean they'll change them all. The characters might remain the same,  even if the setting is different. And honestly,  I'm not really sure that's a bad thing. I like the setting of the show,  but the characters have always been the biggest draw,  and I think they can stand on their own. </div>
<p></p>That's the problem though.  They can't.  These are archetypes that have been done hundreds of times,  and what sets them apart comes right from the setting.  Without that stuff,  it's just <em>The Breakfast Club</em> with wacky hair.  Hell,  it may even be watchable or well-written,  but it wouldn't really have any business being FIM.

            @Mio: Oh,  I am skeptical; I'm just saying we shouldn't declare it a lost cause until we have enough info to say that it is.
<p></p>@Pykrete: We're just gonna have to agree to disagree,  because I think the characters have a lot of depth beyond the core archetypes. I honestly don't think they need the fantastical setting to function; a lot of episodes are based on things that could easily be transferred to a mundane setting.
<p></p>@Turtle: I'd guess they'd go the same route as FIM,  base them on stereotypes,  but subvert it by giving them additional depth. I.e. Rarity is based on a stereotypical fashionista,  but she has a lot of substance beyond being obsessed with fashion.
<p></p>Anyway,  Octavia teaches music. Mr. and Mrs. Cake run the cafeteria (or teach Home Ec.)

            Im also going to say that if that picture of the M6 as humans is real.  I am disappoint that there is no body variation among the characters.  They look like they were done in one of those paper doll generators where you just stick hair and clothes on the same body type.
<p></p>It was ok to do with the ponies,  since they were ... ponies... but with humans it just seems lazy.

            What's to prevent her from being the same way in a high school setting? It's just as fictional as Equestria; just because they're human doesn't mean the world necessarily has to resemble ours that closely.
<p></p>@Edvedd: She's that one teacher that always shows up hungover and doesn't really teach much of anything,  but all the students like her because she's cool.

            Being that the TV Movie is being made by DHX/Top Draw,  they're probably doing the same thing with the main show in that most characters have the same body type to make it easier for the animators. Imagine being asked to convert <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">most of if not the entire cast of Friendship is Magic</a> into humans. Lauren Faust herself wanted variety among the Mane Six,  but knew the animators were working hard enough as is.
<p></p>Also...something tells me Hasbro only wants to make <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">so many doll molds</a>.

            According to that article,  it's more that the girls are being sent on a mission to a strange new world where they take on a different form.
