            I find it interesting that a lot of people seem to like this episode more for RD then Fluttershy,  though understandable since she hasn't had the best episodes this season.
<p></p>I actually did encounter one person who thought that RD was a bad leader in the episode for not assuming Thunderlane was actually sick and sending him home,  and for going after the record. I don't really agree though.

            Hurricane Fluttershy worked best for RD because it showed her at both extremes,  both caring and abrasive,  rather than just one or the other like most episodes do. It also grew her as a leader,  which is something I really like.

<p></p>True. It was very good. But I liked what it did with Fluttershy even more. Also,  like many episodes,  it proved that Twilight is best pony.

            @Mio During the sequence when RD was giving orders she told Thunderlane to trot faster. He was sweating and looked tired. However you could argue that he was just exhausted.

            Re: Lazy Thunderlane,  that might be possible if they went to the same Flight School and Dashie remembers him for slacking more than she did.
<p></p>Dashie's demeanor sometimes reminds me of how I used to be in school sometimes,  letting my attention drift because I already learnt what the teacher had been patiently instructing my slower classmates on,  and then being all impatient and bored and doodling in my textbook. I bet Dashie's old schoolbooks must be full of graffiti :3

            Yeah,  Hurricane Fluttershy was great. But I think my favourite season 2 episode is Hearth's Warming Eve. It was fun seeing the mane six in other roles. Especially Pinkie as Chancellor Puddinghead. ("The Earth is round. There is no up or down!")
<p></p>I did find it odd that Dash kept calling Thunderlane lazy. She's quite lazy herself.

            @Ace: Yes I did and is scared my coat off.
<p></p>@Purple: For elementary flight classes? No. Every pegasi must go through at least 2 years of flight training. Think about it; a pegasus that can't fly won't be able to leave Cloudsdale or visit it if they live on the ground. After their 2 years of training are done,  they can opt out of additional training if they so choose to.
