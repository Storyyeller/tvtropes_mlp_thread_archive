            Hey something weird did come to my attention about this show earlier today and I was not able to post anything then.
<p></p>While I was going over the episodes from this season in my head,  I realized something. Equestria,  or actually Ponyville in particular has a horribly unstable economy.
<p></p>For one thing Ponyville-no Equesteria dosen't have a tax code (despite still having METROPOLITAN cities),  they practice a pretty ridged for of <em>laissez-faire</em> capitalism,  and nearly all of the large businesses in Ponyville are monopolies (Sweet Apple Acres - apples,  The Cake Family - confectionery goods,  not sure if Rarity's clothing/tailoring shop counts). So one of the many questions that popped in my head is how was the plot of "Apple Cider" episode possible again? I mean with all the land they own,  not to mention extended family,  the Apple family should not have been worried at all about the Flim Flam brothers. Even with the machine they would not lose that much business by the size of their inventory.
<p></p>And this put another thought into my head,  how are The Apple Family not the richest family in the greater Ponyville area? They founded the town by ROYAL charter and have been running the business for a century. How are they in any way vulnerable to financial ruin when you're a 100 year old monopoly that has one of the most important commodities in the area?

            @Allik I don't think Apples are as vital in Ponyville as you make em out to be. They sell two very popular products (Zap-Apple Jam and Cider) but even those are special and only get produced at one time of the year.
<p></p>It's also said that Barnyard Bargains has been monopilizing retail in Ponyville,  so they're probably stealing a lot of casual business from the Apples

            @Mousa I'm pretty sure that in the local food business in town they would use apples for <em>something</em> so I think they are. Even so they have been running Sweet Apple Acres for at least 100 years...or do they rely on farm subsidies from the state government?

            oooooooooor,  ponies for the most part don't give a buck about money for the sake of money and even if they ARE monopolies don't engage in the price gouging and other dirty tricks that make monopolies bad,  instead making sure that all ponies are taken care of just out of a sense of decency.
