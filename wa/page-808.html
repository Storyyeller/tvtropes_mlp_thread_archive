            What the heck is with Spike/Applebloom,  after all?  Do they ever interact at <em>all</em>,  or is it just age-related <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares">Pair the Spares</a>?
<p></p>I'll admit I do tend to ignore Rarity's less savory personality characteristics.  The not-insigificant amount of time when she's actually being a good person tends to override the times when she acts bitchily or shallowly in my hindsight; it's been a while since I've actually seen the episodes,  as well.

            Being bitchy,  or shallow every now and then does nothing but add personality. It makes her human (pony),  and the times where she was good infinitely outweigh the isolated times in which she was kinda bitchy

            <em>I think it is hard to accept her becuase she is the only kind lady like character we know.</em>
<p></p>It's hard for me to accept her because her generosity seems more like something that was written on her character sheet and then forgotten to actually be included in play.
<p></p>There was...maybe one episode I can recall,  where she was all about making dresses for her friends. Right,  that's pretty generous. The rest of the time is usually spent acting more as a foil.
<p></p>Are there far worse characters? Well,  yes,  both in and out of the series. But I don't think pointing at someone else and saying "She's not THAT!" suddenly makes her a better char.

            Spike/Applebloom is one of those bits of fanon that started because someone drew a cute picture or comic or something that a lot of people liked.  You're right though,  in the show itself they haven't interacted at all.

            Yes indeed.  Compared to Panty and Stocking,  <em>anyone</em> seems like a lady; it's Blueblood who shows us what Rarity would be like if she was <em>nothing</em> but a prissy bitch,  though.  In truth,  I think she's one of the more realized characters in the show.

<p></p>Even Lauren said that the team had to be careful not to make her unlikeable.
<p></p>But she has shown us that she really is a good person,  not just by making dresses. She sacrificed her beauty to help steve Magnet in the pilot. She also put flutershy's happyness over hers in the episode with photo finish to give a few exmples.

            My favorite type of character is the kind-hearted prim and proper lady,  so I can assure you there's definitely no Libbification here. :p
<p></p>And yeah,  she's more than definitely a "good person"—just the fact that she's a protagonist alone designates her as a "good person",  so the fact that she simply reaches the bar doesn't really set her apart. I just think that they could do less with trying to bounce off her flaws and more trying to emphasize her generosity so that it seems like an integral part of the character. Like,  for example,  in the opening of this new episode—she asks if she can help. Without getting wet. Or dirty. Or coming out from the umbrella. Or etc.
<p></p>It's a funny joke,  but that seems to be almost exclusively the jokes made about her throughout the entire last season...and it feels like it directly contrasts with how generous she's supposed to be,  at that,  what few opportunities she has to demonstrate it. Because of the frequency,  she comes off more as a snob and less an elegant maiden.
<p></p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Am I seriously debating about a pony's personality on an internet forum? I'm not sure whether to feel like a nerd or Commander Badass.

            ^^That's true,  she does - and she doesn't make a fuss about it,  either.  She can't lend hooves like Applejack can (being a unicorn and not farm-raised,  two strikes against her physical strength),  but she does what she can.
<p></p>^Hey now.  The point of Rarity's segment of "The Best Night Ever" was to show that she was <em>better</em> than the class she wanted to join,  not that she couldn't make it.  She would be stooping.  (If that's what you meant,  sorry for reading it wrong - 'not cut out' has somewhat negative connotations,  to me at least.)

<p></p>She's (supposed to be) above Blueblood,  because she doesn't use her elegance/class to look down on people. Nobility is two things,  a state of mind and a state of class. Someone can be a peasant and still act noble and elegant,  or someone can be an elegant noble just by class and not act it in the least. Rarity is (supposed to be) both,  from what I gather. I'm pretty sure she'd be fine at the sort of events if the other people attending were level-headed like she is (supposed to be).

            @Jesus Saves: Did you just register your account?  New accounts have to wait a week before they can create new threads,  if I remember correctly.
<p></p>Um,  as far as Rarity's generosity goes,  have we forgotten that there was an entire episode devoted to her making 2 sets of elaborate dresses for her friends,  free of charge?  Because you'd have to be pretty generous to sacrifice that much time and effort for little to no return.  It may have only been one episode,  but that's honestly a pretty big deal; she basically ignored her business for a few days for their sake.
<p></p>She does have bitchy moments,  but it's not like that's her standard characterization or anything.  I think it's more that she has more specific tastes than the other characters,  so whenever they clash we're more likely to come down on the other character's side.  Like in Look Before You Sleep,  I get the feeling that both Rarity and Applejack were supposed to be roughly even,  but I think a lot of fanbase sympathizes more with Applejack's practicality than Rarity's attention to detail.

            I'm not a 100% sure that Rarity would enjoy high-class life,  even if she found people who were genuinely pleasant. It just isn't her. She's a ponyvillian at heart,  despite herself. She enjoys socializing with high class people every now and then (sometimes it's nice to be around people with similar tastes),  but I bet she'd get bored after a while if she had to actually LIVE like that. If that makes sense?
