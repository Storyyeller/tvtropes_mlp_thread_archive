<p></p>Just because the original author went back and said <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SureWhyNot" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SureWhyNot">Sure, Why Not?</a> to a fan's justification for the situation doesn't mean that the original story isn't at fault. That added chapter was <em>not</em> the intent of the original author,  so I can still fault the story with said issues as it is originally written.

            I would have preferred a Chosen One player character instead,  based on the Fallout 2 protagonist. They'd have legit reason to be stressed over the village elder insisting they live up to the legend of their ancestor and tribe founder. It would also add a legit pressure for them to save their village by finding the GCCK (Gardens of Canterlot Creation Kit).

            @Seraphem: I think what he means is that when FE was originally written that chapter wasn't there to fill that gap in the story.  The chapter is basically a retcon that goes back and fills a hole that was there.  The hole might be filled <em>now</em> but the author of the original story didn't fill it.  It sounds like you're saying "it's okay that the story had a plot hole because somebody else went back and wrote something to explain it".  It might have an explanation <em>now</em>,  but it doesn't mean that there isn't a hole.  You shouldn't <em>have</em> a gap in your story that forces somebody else to write something that explains it.

            @Seraphem
<p></p>I'm not disputing the story's declared canon. I'm saying that the holes were present in the original work,  and had to be filled by someone else. The author still messed up in her story.
<p></p>It's like in comic books. Just because a later author goes back and retcons or justifies the events of a bad story by a past author to make sense doesn't change the fact that the original story is still bad.

I know that you can technically skip those parts,  but I feel like if a big chunk of the chapter is irrelevant enough that you can skip it,  those chunks of the chapter shouldn't be there.

<p></p>She asked if homage,  who knows more about what damn near everything in the wastelands then anypony,  knew of any mares that might like her. Which given her orientation is perfectly reasonable,  making a big deal about "know any lesbians" would be like if Pip were straight and you made a big deal altering her words to say "hey know any straight stallions?"

            @Yeller: I just find the Chosen One has a more compelling background than the Vault Dweller of the third Fallout. The Original Dweller was interesting,  but I still prefer the Chosen One's story because Horrigan was a neat antagonist and there was so much to do.

<p></p>This is why I'll probably never finish it (apart from it being boring). It's been so long since I stopped reading that I'd have to reread large parts of teh series to get it.

            Ah yes,  Dune.  It had a lot of really cool concepts and the setting is really cool,  but the prose itself can be painfully dull.  I read the second book and when I was done I felt like very little had happened,  and I had no idea what had caused anything.

            Except we don't know the hole would exist. if 20.5 was written after the entire story was completed then yeah you two would be right. but since it was written while the story was still in progress,  there's nothing to say kkat wouldn't have filled in the hole on her own at some point but didn't see the need to after 20.5
