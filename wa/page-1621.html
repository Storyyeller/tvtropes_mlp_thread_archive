            Dorku: I don't think so.  Extrapolating from the small amount of sports exposure I have,  I think stuff like that requires an official title match in order to transfer.  Aside from that,  I don't think I could beat Fluttershy at that game anyway.
<p></p>Badwolf: I don't know,  I think some people would feel overpowered by how extroverted she is.
<p></p>Ginger: True.  Although I'd think AJ would be pretty approachable too.

            I think Pinkie would scare me,  even though her intentions are good.
<p></p>Edit—interesting update on Faust's deviantart regarding Luna
<p></p>This is how I had it worked out—— NMM did not just intend to make eternal night,  but to usher in an era of evil. Celestia had a responsibility to her "people" to protect them. Not many viewers noticed,  but the narration in the opening of the pilot said that Celestia banished her "reluctantly." She didn't want to do it,  but had to.
<p></p>Luna was no longer present,  jealousy buried her inside NMM. The possibility of drawing Luna's goodness out from NMM's form was not possible for 1, 000 years (she stayed NMM while in the moon)and Celestia did what she could to orchestrate the events the led to breaking the spell jealousy had put on her.
<p></p>I know this leads to many more questions (why 1, 000 to break the spell,  why didn't Celestia do more,  why Twilight and the gang,  etc.) but that's as far as I ever got with it.
<p></p>Hope that helps. Don't take it as canon,  though. The folks who are carrying on the show may have a different way of unfolding it someday.

I think that's enough to infer that there's some sort of corrupting influence there.  Unless you're dealing with a severe case of dissociative identity disorder,  most people don't have their emotions bury them inside an evil entity.

            I'm just going to see how Luna's characterization gets developed in the future before I decide to take it as canon or not.  My only real issue with it is that it makes Luna sound like she just has some sort of severe dissociative identity disorder or something,  and I don't think that really fits the show; some sort of outside influence is necessary,  like Discord leaving some sort of sleeper spell,  or Luna attempting to power herself up and losing control or something.  Otherwise it means that Luna is perpetually one bad day away from trying again.
<p></p>As for the hanging out with ponies question,  having crossed off Twilight,  I'd say either Applejack or Fluttershy.  Rarity would be horrified by my lack of fashion sense and try to give me a makeover,  and RD and Pinkie Pie would be fun to hang out with for half an hour or so,  at which point I'd probably go insane.  I couldn't keep up with them.

            Here's my contribution:
<p></p>Luna being corrupted makes the most sense,  though I stick by my opinion that it was <em>mostly</em> Luna's jealousy and anger that changed her.  The outside force just facilitated it.
<p></p>If there's no outside force,  you realize,  then that means that Celestia could easily transform as well (well,  not easily,  but...) Anyway,  that wouldn't be pretty.

            My headcanon has always been that Luna initially only wanted to keep the moon up for a few hours or a day longer than normal,  but Celestia adamantly refused and forced her to lower it. Broken,  Luna casts a magic spell on herself to give her more power (so she can keep the moon up a bit longer like she wanted). The spell ends up corrupting her mind,  not brainwashing her,  not adding any additional malevolent thoughts to her head,  just making her a lot more unhinged and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnTheDarkSide" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnTheDarkSide">Drunk on the Dark Side</a>

Pre Nightmare Moon she had pink hair. Post she had rainbow flowy hair. Not as dramatic a transformation but still a transformation. Plus Luna can still go into her Nightmare Moon form according to Nightmare Night. I don't think the form of Nightmare Moon was inherently evil,  she just used it for evil.
<p></p>If Applejack makes me food I will become good at farming just to help her.
