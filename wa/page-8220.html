            Wow,  so this schedule shift means I get to watch 19 and 20 on a weekend. Nice.
<p></p>But that means the last two of S1 get shunted to the weekday.

            well latest info on the C&D it doesn't say she can't still make plushies,  she just can't advertise about them or offer commissions. She can still make them and put them up on E-Bay.
<p></p>Further,  White Dove herself was never told to stop at all. Hasbro simply asked DA to have her remove her posts about them from DA. Not for her to stop making plushies altogether.

            yeah reading the latest info,  hasbro really is doing the bare minimum they need to do to avoid legal issues of there own. All they did was ask DA to ask her to remove her advertising for the plushies from the site,  that's it. Not stop making them,  just stop publicly advertising about them.

Or somehthine like that. So I have no idea what time it's gonna start due to this.

            they ain't lazy,  they've made it,  unofficially,  clear that they don't want to step on the Bronies and they want us to go nuts,  they do the bare minimum required to avoid ant sort of trademark/copyright issues for themselves and that it.
<p></p>Only things they actually stepped in on before this that I know of is a few random youtube takedowns,  but no where near as many as they could,  just enough to keep the lawyers happy. And a C&amp;D order for the site that used to have free downloads of the episodes..and that they left up for quite awhile,  having to know it exists what with every new episode having a link to it from EQD,  they only dropped the C&amp;D on them after the site started trying to ask for money from people.

            Well,  it's in a company's best interest not to piss off their target market,  and since we're now part of their target market...
<p></p>Um,  not that I'm saying they're driven purely by profit. I'm pretty sure they're smart and reasonable people,  and that's at least half the reason they're trying not to piss us off.
