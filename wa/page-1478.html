            Just skimming through the TV tropes character pages (y'know,  because that's something I do on a regular basis and all)
<p></p>I know I oftentimes sound like a broken record,  but Can someone PLEASE find the the Lauren quote where she said that Luna was being posessed by something. The only one I remember was relating PURELY to Nightmare Moon's physical appearance,  and nowhere in it did she mention Luna's mental state. If there's some other quote out there that I've somehow missed regarding this issue then please share it with me. I wanna get this topic outta my mind as quickly as possible.
<p></p>It's just that at the moment we seem to be going out of our way to seperate the two characters as much as possible,  and at almost every trope we seem to be reminding people "Oh no,  it wasn't Luna's choice,  she was being posessed this whole time, " It just kinda... bugs me.

<p></p>And this outside force can corrupt only how she look? She can change shape while not corupted and look like NM.
<p></p>And who exacly say that she was  posessed this whole time? Exept few fans,  mostly die hard fans of Woobie Luna who prefer blame Tyrant Celestia for everything.

            I think it'd be interesting if Luna has chosen to believe (and perhaps maybe even Celestia thinks) that she was corrupted and taken over to some degree,  but that when the magic/presence/entity finally appears we learn that she had much more control than she cared to admit.
<p></p>Could be a nice character building moment of Luna admitting her mistake,  especially if this thing tries to influence another pony.

I say she can't have all blame for every what Nightmare Moon have done.
<p></p>There is diffrenst between Good Turns Evil (and turns back later ) and  Turn To The Dark Side (and turned back later).  I know normal character can evolve into bad guy and later evolve into good guy again but it have to be long process.   But this not that case,   Luna was hited by Care Beare Stare,  and if any <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSide" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSide">Dark Side</a> or other Coruption wasn't involved this mean that she was brainwashed into good again - and that's big NO NO.

<p></p>Also,  I DO think she was corrupted (as you said,  brainwashed into being good doesn't sound very family friendly <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16"> ),  I just don't think she became an entirely different pony. She was more <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnTheDarkSide" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnTheDarkSide">Drunk on the Dark Side</a> than flat out possessed IMO. The elements basically cleared her head and got rid of her dark powers (which she says herself in Luna Eclipsed) allowing her think clearly for the first time in a thousand years.
<p></p>I also think the corruption was something she brought on herself (she merely refers to Nightmare Moon as HER Dark powers,  not another consciousness altogether)

            I don't think we'll ever get a concrete,  in-show answer to the question of Nightmare Moon.  At most,  we can expect characters to make some vague statements that describe what <em>they believed</em> happened,  and just let us form our own conclusions.  And since the show isn't even very <em>internally</em> consistent (are these ponies celebrities or aren't they?) we really have nothing but theories anyway.  Wouldn't surprise me if you asked Lauren about it three different times and got a different answer each time.
<p></p>Personally,  my theory is that Luna Selena Delicatessa Cosmos Equestrios III ate a Hershey Bar and was transported into the future where,  during the fall of the Silver Millennium she was possessed by the spirit of Queen Metalia of the Bydo Empire and sent back in time to destroy all Ponydom.  But the Bydo hadn't counted on the Elements of Harmony which are formed from fragments of the Nova Force and activated by friendship (again?) and so their plan failed.  Only then did Luna realize how utterly terrible things had gone.
<p></p>And a free sweet apple to anyone who catches every single reference in the above paragraph without looking it up.

            So like Coco Natts has said above me,  the show is going to start airing on Discovery Kids Latin America. Now,  you'd think this would be fine until you realize that the channel has degraded into another preschooler channel like Treehouse,  Barney and all. At least now,  there's going to be another country that's going to be in the same boat as us Canadians...that is until someone reports that they won't censor it in Latin America.

<p></p>Luna = because that's what she's called in the show. <br>Selena = because that's what she's called in the storybook that came with the gift set. <br>Delicatessa = because I felt like there needed to be another word here. <br>Cosmos = because she's a celestial goddess of sorts. <br>Equestrios = because she co-rules Equestria (presumably "Cosmos Equestrios" indicates "Goddess of the Equestrion galaxy") <br>III = Because it feels wrong to have a name like this and not end it on a number,  and so many great things have a 3 in their name.  Super Mario 3,  The Three Musketeers,  Lupin the Third...
<p></p>... and I <em>just now</em> understood why Ace of Scarabs suggested adding "Faustia" to the name *facepalm*.  Though,  perhaps "Faustia" should replace "Delicatessa" since "Faustia" has relevance,  while "Delicatessa" is just something I pulled out of nowhere.
<p></p>So... which is better:
<p></p>Luna Selena Faustia Cosmos Equestrios III
<p></p>or
<p></p>Luna Selena Delicatessa Cosmos Equestrios III?
