            @Bagof I don't know if its the best of the series since I've only played 6 but I like the artwork in it.  Namely the Geiger inspired King of Hell.

            @Light Phaser: To quote the trope page:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Conker's Bad Fur Day is a 2001 video game. Originally developed as a kiddy game under the name of <em>Conker's Quest</em> and later Twelve Tales: Conker 64,  Rare's next game in the Conker series was heading to become another run-of-the-mill platform game. Apparently,  Rare changed their mind during production,  and instead set out to create a "controversial" game aimed at adults and older teens.
<p></p>Inspired by South Park,  the then newly renamed Conker's Bad Fur Day promised to use scatological humour,  sexual innuendo (some more subtle than others),  cartoon violence,  and excessive swearing. Originally thought to be an April Fools joke,  the announcement turned out to be completely true.
<p></p>Thankfully,  what could have been a shockingly bad gimmick of a game gained rave reviews from critics over its graphics,  adult sense of humour,  and entertaining gameplay,  not to mention being considered a technical marvel at its time for squeezing hundreds of lines of spoken dialogue into a single game cartridge. Due to a combination of the Nintendo 64 (which was nearing the end of its run by the time of the game's release)) being smashed down by the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayStation" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> and Nintendo's refusal to advertise the game much at all,  Bad Fur Day ended up a as a largely commercial failure.
<p></p>A few years later,  after Rare was bought out by Microsoft,  an "enhanced" remake of the game,  Conker: Live and Reloaded came out. This game was an even larger commercial failure,  thanks to Microsoft's odd marketing plan and changes to the original game. And censorship. While Bad Fur Day has a cult following,  Live and Reloaded has some fans and a Hatedom.</div>

And yeah,  that's not a great excuse.
<p></p>I guess it's because the story seems to not make the main villains bossfights. The bossfights are more like forces of nature,  demons,  or beasts who have little dialogue. The most dialogue comes from the party talking among themselves,  revelations from Gaia,  mysterious events,  or discourse with antagonists who do not become bossfights later.
<p></p>Trust me,  the dialogue is pretty good,  make no mistake about that.

            Well,  the FF games of that era had the benefit of being strictly <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGs">RP Gs</a> rather than action-rpgs,  Ginger.  Like I said there are a few story-arc villains.  The other thing is you're assuming is that the driving factor of the plot is because of man.

            Right. The plot is driven by a prophecy,  an impending disaster,  and Will's determination.
<p></p>I'm really trying to sell the game without spoiling stuff.
