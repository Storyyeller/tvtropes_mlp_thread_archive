            If they've already faced their shadow,  then certainly. The big thing about all of the social links is that you help the characters overcome their shadows entirely - they leave the repression behind,  and accept who they are. sometimes they overcome their faults and insecurities,  and sometimes they accept an essential facet of their being.
<p></p>A deeply introspective person could easily overcome their own shadows,  in theory. An unexplored facet of ones personality isn't necessarily a shadow,  it's more like obliviousness. For example if you were to point out something to AJ that she'd never realized she likely wouldn't deny it,  she'd simply consider it interesting and move on with it.

            @blissey: Eh,  I don't know... I'd consider Pinkie to be less "You're going to come to my parties" and more "Please,  please come." I see her more like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kanji or Naoto</span>,  desperately wanting to show who she <em>really</em> is behind the mask,  but afraid of people rejecting it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Chie</span> I saw more as just being insecurity and feeling a bit worthless next to someone else.
<p></p>EDIT: Scratch that,  Pinkie isn't <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> like Kanji: she IS Rise</span>. The world sees a different face,  and it's not the one that's really there. but it's what she puts on anyways,  because it's what people respond to. She wears it to keep herself confident,  but all she really wants is for someone to see past it.
<p></p>@Kyler: Okay,  that makes sense. Yeah,  it's distinclty possible there's something she represses we haven't been made privy to,  like her parents or something.

            That does make sense. From what we've seen of her character,  she has a very interesting dichotomy going: she wants to make other people happy,  but she is also desperate to have them accept her in return. We've seen her coming up against the latter thing several times ("<a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartyOfOne" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartyOfOne">They don't like me anymore</a>",  or "<a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReturnOfHarmony" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReturnOfHarmony">They NEVER liked you</a>"),  and the former once.

            I'm not sure if we could say that Pinkie shows a mask to the world. We've seen her alone and uninhibited,  and she seems to be the same. Rather,  her big thing is a fierce desire for companionship and an almost crippling need for people to like her.
<p></p>I think I've said before that she has a lot of people who she knows,  and who like her in general,  but very few actual <em>friends</em>.

            I can see Pinkie's shadow being an extremely cling emotional vampire. She already shows shades of this,  even when she isn't being Pinkamena. Note how she constantly hounds Rainbow Dash in <em>Griffon the Brush Off</em>.
<p></p>I wonder if her relationship with her family soured,  and that's why she moved out of the rock farm. And why she clings so desperately to other people. Family is pretty much one of the closest relationships you can have with another person. That's not an easy hole to fill.

            I doubt she became estranged from her family. They,  after all,  liked her change (at least initially,  from what we saw). It's more likely that she decided to move to a place with more people in order to further spread joy and such.

            It's mostly because I don't like the idea that she would just be exempt from it. <br> <br>I would say that the protagonist didn't have a shadow because he arguably doesn't exist as a character until you answer for him during the story. But that's really not a valid point,  it's more like an excuse. You're supposed to be him and all that. They can't give him problems if he's supposed to be you. AJ does,  so I feel like she would have something applied to her. <br> <br>And with the "confront easily" thing,  it was more that she would fully understand what her issue was and accept it without having to flat out deny them. She is not the type of person/pony who would deny herself like that. Maybe she wouldn't have a shadow,  but she has some problems and she would have to accept them before going persona. <br> <br>Also,  since I brought up Bull-Fluttershy. Any ideas for the others?
<br>I didn't read all the posts while I was typing this,  so things said may have made some of what I said moot or the subject changed. Like I said though,  I don't know enough about psychology and/or the mind and such to really know what I'm saying. just ideas. You can kind of see what I'm trying to say though,  I think. :v

            From what I can gather here,  if a shadow is a part of oneself that they are repressing,  I have to agree with Kegi that AJ straight up wouldn't have one. As the bearer of the Element of Honesty,  she has nothing to hide. Not from herself,  and not from anyone else. What you see is what you get.

            There was a discussion about Persona 4,  one of my favorite games ever,  and I missed it?  Curse you work.
<p></p>Ah well,  its the weekend now.  Time to pretend I plan on doing something fun but end up loafing around the house all day.
<p></p>Apparently I'm marrying Bon Bon.  Why couldn't it have been a day to either side?  I'd have been fine with Trixie or Derpy.  Now I'm a beard.  Fantastic.
