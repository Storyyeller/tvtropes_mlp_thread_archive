            Gotta admit I'm surprised that Rarity did so well.  Although the voting might have been biased due to the fact that her episode just came out.
<p></p>Anyway,  I'm going to post <a class="urllink" href="http://japaneseteeth.deviantart.com/#/d4i7eec">my review<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> again for those who didn't see it when I posted it last night.

            No,  wait,  I made a mistake again. Fluttershy is second. AJ and Rarity share third spot.

She's one helluva aeronaut,  but sticks to a simple Weatherpony job so she has more free time to train her aeronautics and nap and prank everypony.
<p></p>Same goes for Pinkie,  who's the best planner and caterer this side of Ponyville,  yet she prefers to work under the Cake family and have extra free time for parties and pranks.
<p></p>Fluttershy is the town vet/ranger,  she works together with other ponies for Animal Control from time to time but generally prefers to live simply at the edge of town because of her shyness.
<p></p>Just bought an Applejack fig (brushable mane,  since Hasbro Singapore didn't bring in the blindbags D:). The dog that comes with her is remarkably like Winona. Need a hat for her.
<p></p>I rather believe Celestia and Luna are basically running the Sun/Moon while the Creator Lauren is out there somewhere. There are other Alicorns out there who also have work of their own,  but are busy enough they don't have time to come to Equestria.

            Yeah,  the common thread between Rarity and Applejack is that they run their own businesses.  It's one way they can relate enough to be friends despite obviously being each other's foils sometimes.

            Oh,  yeah,  AJ's been groomed as a Manehattenite once before. I imagine Rarity's a little sad AJ doesn't pamper herself more often.
<p></p>I still find it funny the time I took that "what pony are you?" quiz earlier in the thread,  I'm pretty much a strange gestalt of Twilight,  Rarity,  and most of all,  Pinkie. I guess my extensive amounts of energy and tendency to go meta and get obscure tipped the scales.

            A big Thank You to Kayeka for his efforts <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin">. Interesting results. Twilight winning by a landslide,  should have been no surprise. Fluttershy,  AJ and Rarity being very close,  Dashie and Pinkie behind (wow,  OK,  the lack of Pinkie love WAS surprising) and Trixie at least with a very honorable spot YES.
<p></p>Pity there were no other votes for Zecora,  that zebra is seriously underrated. I could practically gush over Zecora for a long time,  her design is far and away my favorite in the show. I mean,  just look at her! The jewellery,  the cool sun mark,  the eyes,  the stripes,  the hairdo and she rivals Twilight in overpoweredness with her brand of magic. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">

            I believe Rarity has always been fairly popular.  She's deliciously hammy...she's funny...her episodes tend to rank among the show's best.

            Applebloom did manage to make a potion that didn't kill her,  so I suppose alchemy is a skill that Zecora could,  theoretically,  teach her.
