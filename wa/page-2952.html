            You know,  upon thinking on Baby Cakes for a while and more specifically Pumpkin's use of magic during it,  I think I've come up with a new theory about magic. That mainly,  until you're taught finer control over it,  that it's roughly governed by your desires. Cases in point:
<p></p><ul><li> Pumpkin levitated herself because she wanted to be with her brother.
</li><li> Pumpkin levitated toys over to her because she wanted one
</li><li> Pumpkin managed to phase out of the basket she and Pound were trapped in because she wanted to go out and play
</li><li> She managed to snap a padlock and several chains because she wanted the toys that she knew were in the chest.
</li></ul>

            @Librarian: Of course her magic did what she wanted; she was using it to do what she wanted to do.  It was only doing what she wanted in the way that any tool would when used for its proper purpose.

            I meant like <em>impulsive</em> desires,  the more basic stuff like just "I need to have this" and stuff like that. It was more governed by her sense of want,  rather than a spell that she needed to use for a specific purpose,  like how Twilight normally applies her magic.

            I still don't think the many applications of telekinesis count as a specific spells (it'd be silly to have a spell for 'float baby dragon over to bed and tuck him in',  for instance).  I mean,  conjuration and such like that,  yes,  but the telekinesis we see unicorns use appears to be a general-use ability and not governed by too many limitations.

            Yeah,  I meant just levitation and the phasing spell,  but that doesn't mean that they should know how to do it yet. It may be a general ability that all unicorns use,  but you still have to pick up the basics first in addition to fine-tuning it,  just like walking and talking,  which is stuff that we take for granted but that we have to learn to use. Pumpkin just seemed to be using magic based on emotions and desires at that moment,  and her magic reacted to the impulses.
<p></p>I imagine the thought process kind of going like this:
<p></p>-Pumpkin reaching for butterfly toy- <em>Nrrrrf...urrrrf...toy...want...toy...</em> *telekinesis brings toys over* <em>Cool,  toys! :D</em>

            Yeah,  that's what I'm saying. She only can use it because her desires are so strong,  but eventually she has to actually <em>learn</em> how to use it. I bet that for now as far as she knows,  it's just something that happens whenever she wants something.

            So basically it's intuitive at birth,  then they have to actually learn how to do it once the natural intuitiveness fades?  I can buy that.  Although I still think the fact that she can do stuff that even adult unicorns can't,  like phase through object or levitate herself,  is a bit overkill.  I mean,  the whole point of the episode is that Pinkie is biting off more than she can chew,  and when stuff like that happens it crosses over from "Pinkie isn't as responsible as she thinks she is" into "I wouldn't expect <em>any</em> single pony to have to deal with this".

            ^^Yeah,  I see what you mean now,  Librarian.  Rather than having to think (as much as any motion requires thought,  I suppose,  but let's not get into brain/body duality and intent/motion and things like that) 'lift the toy,  now bring it closer to me,  now shove it in my mouth',  it's 'toy toy want want toy now'.
<p></p>^Yeah,  you make a good point with that.  It would have been a stronger episode without the superpowered children,  but I still enjoyed it quite a lot and it gave Pinkie some good characterization regardless.
<p></p>...Actually,  I wonder if the superpowers could plausibly be related to Pinkie's earlier hallucinations (with the squeaky toy)?  (Also,  what did you mean by Homestuck making squeaky things scary?  I've never read it.)
