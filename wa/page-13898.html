While it's something I've been fortunate enough not to experience myself,  the phenomena of friends genuinely wanting to 'help' homosexuals 'get better' is all too real,  and I imagine far more painful than if they just suddenly hated you.

For example,  a history of the Ukranian genocide/the experience of a mother doing anything to protect her child. Neat,  but... doesn't really fit the mold.

The great majority of authority figures are females,  and for the most part they're all portrayed as high competent in their given disciplines.

            Who cares? As long as it impacts somepony,  the numbers are pointless. Games can be a powerful narrative form,  Photopia and Planetfall for instance. Again,  interactive fiction and pretty obscure,  but my point still stands.

            Ordinarily I'd be inclined to agree,  but it's <em>because</em> they're such a powerful form that I want games with ideas to be as big as they can. There'll always be a market for simple fun,  and I never think a game should sacrifice fun for it's moral,  but the medium is,  quite frankly,  woefully underutilized in terms of what it <em>could</em> do. Moreover it's major fanbase is <em>exactly</em> the kind of people who could benefit from it the most.
<p></p>I have a <em>lot</em> of things that I want to do in my lifetime,  and a lot of stories I want to tell and messages I'd like to spread,  but the thing I want to do most of all is leave a positive and lasting impact on the medium that I love. I want video games to be better than they are right now,  and the only way to do that is to push for better games to get bigger releases. If it wasn't for that I'd have given up on the AAA scene long ago and went for indie.

            I'd love to do indie stuff,  personally,  it's just that I lack the artistic talent to do anything beyond program things. Good games need good art direction,  and good art direction directs good game design. I'd need to collaborate to actually make a game,  and there's nobody to do that with.

            Don't get me wrong,  I love the indie scene and I'd love to be a part of it. There's some absolutely wonderful games that come out of there. But at the same time... well,  like I said. I'd like so that indie-styled games could get full sized releases,  as well.

            @Sexism. I can not see how this show is sexist. Unless you mean towards men,  and even then,  the only thing that so far seems unattainable to men in that world is princess status. (Princes do exist but seem alot less powerful/useful). Everything else seems equal. And to be honest,  if that's an issue for you,  get over yourself. Disliking that is petty as hell.
<p></p>Saying this though,  the only comments that this show is sexist I've seen was that one woman who judged the show before it was out,  and included examples such as horns being phallic symbols. I didn't see a single comment agreeing with her on the feminism website she posted that on.

            Its not exactly surprising to have people like that bashing the show,  regardless of stance. People like that are all over the internet. Anyone remember that hyper right wing Christian blog linked on this thread a long time ago that had such arguments as "Animals don't have souls,  so this show is satanic!"? Same blog thought that Linux was evil,  and used the fact that Linux users pay more in the humble indie bundles as an example. "They clearly are too stupid to use money!" That blog was always good for a laugh.
