            @Seraph Ah,  but I thought we were going with the idea that the winner of the contest would be performing for the princesses.
<p></p>Y'know,  a bit like how it works over in britain,  with the winner performing for the queen.

            Derpy's performance would probably have something to do with blowing bubbles into impressive arrangements and designs. I mean,  there's so much fanon attached to her,  but no one ever gives her cutie mark a second thought outside "oh,  she has a bubbly personality".

<p></p>which by the way,  you should read when it's done ginger,  it's got both Discord AND Nicodemus as villains. Plus it's Dresden,  he NEVER gets to curbstomp anything,  he always gets beat senseless while fighting.

            yes what ever you do ginger stay away from the short story that started it,  <em>Forever!</em> All Pinkie does in MLD that is overly Pinkie-ish is have the abilty to travel "outside" which is the REASON for her oddness,  not an effect of it. And it's something anyone with enough magical power could do,  it's just most are smart enough not to...also anyone from Dresden's world that gets caught trying to do so get beheaded instantly.
<p></p>really once she gets him to Equestria she fades out from the fic,  well fades into the mane group and is no worse then on the show.

            @Ginger Where exactly are you getting your information on what people do and don't think? I get the feeling that you're so self-defeating that as soon as someone says something contrary to your opinion,  you immediately assume that you're in the minority and everyone else agrees with that opinion.
