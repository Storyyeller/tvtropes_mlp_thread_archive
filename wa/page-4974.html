            @AHR: It went very well.  California is awesome,  the weather was wonderful there,  never hot,  never cold.  And the environment was quite a huge change for me.  Here in Texas,  everything is flat and wide open,  with huge parking lots,  big stores,  and long drives between everything.  In California everything is crushed up close together,  with mountains and vegetation everywhere.  I never really thought palm trees were a normal thing outside of the tropics,  but they were everywhere down there.
<p></p>It was great to see my brother (we went to watch him graduate from Marine Boot Camp,  then take him back home for leave).  At first it was a little alarming,  since he seemed like a completely different person,  but after a day or two of freedom he relaxed and started to act himself again.
<p></p>We didn't actually <em>do</em> much worthy of note,  just visited various touristy things.  I really liked San Diego,  but L.A. and especially Hollywood just felt shallow and scummy to me.  And we really shouldn't have gone walking down Hollywood Blvd in the middle of the night,  it was actually kind of frightening.
<p></p>@Edvedd: I always read your posts in Applejack's voice.  I can't help it.
