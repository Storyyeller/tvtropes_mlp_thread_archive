            @Badwolf: The whole thing with the train was a creative choice by Lauren that was eventually ocveruled (probably for the best). As for the fight,  well what would you expect from the show at that stage? They couldn't exactly do the hoof to hoof combat that they could do in Canterlot Wedding with both TV-Y and E/I on a show for young girls. Though I will agree that it was a little to silly,  even by the shows standards.

Though I'm curious,  why do you dislike those two episodes? Briddle Gossip was actually the second episode of the show that I watched.

            The beggining of Over the Barrel was great and hillarious. The rest...not so much. Too many decisions that made no sense. The Mane 6 feeling like extras. And yeah,  the train and pie fight didn't help either. Pinkie doesn't get called out for nearly causing a war. The fact that I considered the buffulo to be so much in the wrong that I could barely sympathise with them at all and was <em>angry</em> that Rainbow sided with them (admittedly,  this may be due to the influences of my living situation). Was t <em>bad</em>? No. But it wasn't the quality that I'm used to from the show.
<p></p>EDIT: Personally I loved Bridle Gossip and Cutie Pox to bits,  but to each his own.

            Slice of Life has a HILARIOUS and so perfect i wish it was canon explanation for the pies.
<p></p>In the last few centuries the nations of the world have been at peace,  but there are still some youngsters and older creatures that need to burn off a bit of excess energy and just have a good fight,  so the counties have set up a system to engage in mock "wars" using pies,  foam swords,  water balloons,  stuff like that.
<p></p>So basically it's been going on so long,  that's how they think wars SHOULD be fought and were ll just playing along.

            As much as I would love to start the buffalo debate again,  I don't think anyone else wants to talk about that again. I still think both sides were equally in the wrong,  but eh.
<p></p>@Bad I can't bring myself to hate classic cartoon homages.
<p></p>Something people seem to keep forgetting is that is show <em>is a comedy.</em> I keep getting the feeling that people are starting to expect drama and logic from the show as if it took itself far more seriously than it actually did.

<p></p>Yes,  exactly.  I wish would stop forgetting that this is primarily a comedy universe.  And much better off for it.

If it really wanted to have none of these things then it should be wackier and more episodic.
<p></p>Then again I'm a bit biased on that front.

            @Mio Whacky comedy and quality characterization/internal consistency should not be mutually exclusive. Even when the show has taken itself quite seriously,  such as A Canterlot Wedding,  it has still been extremely lighthearted at heart,  and still had comedy in the more serious moments. You <em>can</em> have it both ways.
