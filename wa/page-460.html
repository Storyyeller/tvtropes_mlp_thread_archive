We have two examples of defeat for an antagonist not meaning friendship in this show itself,  Trixie and Gilda,  and while I not going to stir up that discussion <em>again</em>...
<p></p>Anyway,  ben10fan,  you seem to be missing a very important distinction between 'a villain' and 'a complete monster'.  Yes,  the pilot had a villain,  but she was a fairly tragic figure once you think about it - and she showed remorse and repentance once she was purified.  A <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monster</a> in those circumstances would spit in Twilight's face as she offered him a hoof up; that's what irredeemable means.  No forgiveness,  and not a single instant of looking for it.

            Leaving aside for a moment the fact that that completely misses the point,  The enjoyment of cruel and unspeakable acts is evil. Freiza,  was evil.
<p></p>Slightly more along the actual point,  what is it,  exactly,  that you disagree with? I made several points in that post. Do you disagree with all of them? Do you disagree that the introduction of a monster would create a tonal shift?

            True,  clear CM is character who you don't like because he is that evil.
There are many bad guys who are not true,  clear CM,  they are pure evil but you still can like them.
<p></p>For exmaple Xykon from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderOfTheStick" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderOfTheStick">Order of the Stick</a>,   he is one of most evil or most evil character in this webcomic but many fants still like him because he is enjoyeable as villain.

            Guys,  we should just try to ignore him. ben10fan hasn't listened to us and that's that,  I'm actually growing intensely weary of him (what with his appearances on other threads aswell)
<p></p>Although,  I would be willing to accept an irredeemable villain in the form of an ancient evil spirit of some kind. I just find it better to leave normal (mortal) villains open to possible redemption,  it allows for multiple interpretations of different characters that can be fun to debate (even if we do get volatile at times) CM's easily become stale if not handled perfectly

            ^^^That's incorrect.  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monster</a> has nothing to do with whether a villain is likeable; Xykon,  for instance,  is specifically listed under the trope (in the Webcomics section).  He's truly,  irredeemably evil,  and whether people like him or not doesn't change his CM status.

<p></p>and Gilda and Trixie are not villains. pure evil or not,  a villain is someone that wants to do something bad and fights the good guys. and I'll stop now as I don't think I have anything else to add.

            They can make good villains,  yes. But they need to be put in specific places for them to work. And <em>they do not work here</em>.
<p></p>Okay,  look at it this way. A complete monster has done something despicable in the world of the show. Now,  while Equestria might be a bit happier than earth,  on the whole we can say it function the same way. So the level of villainy necessary for someone to be considered a complete monster in Equestria is roughly on par with that of earth. Now,  this is subjective,  of course,  but do you know what it takes,  to my mind,  to be considered a monster?
<p></p>Mass murder.
<p></p>Rape.
<p></p><em>child-killing and molesting</em>.
<p></p>That is the level of evil we are dealing with here. Is it so difficult to see why this doesn't belong in a show intended for little girls? Why something so irredeemably vile need not be shown in a world populated by magical talking horses? It would go darker than the 80's version,  back when networks acceptied this kind of stuff. It would give you not just <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a>,  but actual,  physical whiplash.
<p></p>I'm sorry. I hate to be the one to say this,  and I hate even more to have to threaten this. But please,  everyone here has expressed a distaste for this topic. Some of us have expressed a distaste for you personally. Please,  please let it go. Or I will call a mod on you.
<p></p>I'm sorry.

I still can't call CM a character who I like,  Xykon,  Palpatine or others. (Only character who I can remeber and is CM for is Cartman).
But this not discusion for this tread.
