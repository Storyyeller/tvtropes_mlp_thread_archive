Presumably,  they were already appointed by the real Cadance,  which would mean they were her friends.  So,  why did they really get mind-controlled and thrown in the caverns?  Was it because they learned something they shouldn't?  Were they really ever Cadance's friends to begin with?  Have we talked about this before?</span>

            I'm guessing they were friends or something,  and the fake Cadence sent them underground so they wouldn't have any chance of busting her.  I mean,  only the ponies who knew the real Cadence noticed that something was up.

<p></p>The issue with that is it would stonewall a plot line that is already moving PAINFULLY slow. If Danny was defeated in combat it would be a massive set back she couldn't afford and would basically ruin her chances at getting back to Westeros.
<p></p>Danny's whole DEAL in <em>Storm</em> is that it's a "sink or swim" situation,  it's where she really proves she's not just some silly girl who got lucky and hatched some dragons,  it's where she proves she IS a leader,  IS a warrior,  IS the rightful Queen and IS capable of taking back what is hers.
<p></p>Now,  once she has some wins under her belt and where a single defeat won't ruin her cause...then many her own flaws come to the forefront,  and she starts to deal with them.

            @Blue I think Kegi brought up the theory that they could all be ponies Cadence had foalsat for,  being that those exact ponies were the ones who Twilight encountered and blew off in the first episode while she was in Canterlot. As for why they were in the caves,  if the above theory was true,  they would be just as privy to Cadence's strange behavior as Twilight was,  and probably figured it out. Otherwise she may have put them there as guards and to open up space to get on the mane cast's good side by giving them the positions.

            well,  since your ranting about something I've never read,  I'll just say..despite what some people refusing to do anything but look at tings in the worst light (not talking about you ginger) think,  there is a HUGE line between self-confident,  arrogant,  and asshole.
<p></p>your right ginger,  assholes should get called on it,  and any time a pony goes past simple over-abundance of self confidence,  into out right jerkass arrogance,  they do get called on it and taken down a few pegs.
