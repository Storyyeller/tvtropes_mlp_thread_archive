            @ Meta Four:It's not like I was rude or even went out of my way to dodge responsibility for the post,  so that doesn't hold any water. Here is the exact text of my e-mail.<div class="quoteblock">I'm CDRW and was recently banned from all features of the site for making an offensive post in an on topic thread. Since I can't do any pm's with my account,  this is the only way I have to contact you and I wanted to know if this is a permanent ban or if it's just temporary.</div>It was purely a request for information. Had <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastEddie" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastEddie">Fast Eddie</a> made any indication in his response that an an apology or any form of contrition was desired,  I would have done it. Instead I got this.<div class="quoteblock">Can't think of any reason to hang out with a person who thinks enslaving gay people is either a good idea or funny.</div>
<p></p>Request for information made,  information given. It's Fast Eddie's site so he can do what he wants to,  but there is no world fictional or real where refusal to apologize can be considered grounds for keeping me banned because the issue never came up. That is nothing more than trying to save face.
<p></p>Anyways,  I guess I can say goodbye to this sockpuppet account.

            Guys,  can we please keep the banning talk out of this thread.  I know CDRW was a regular here,  and I'd be happy to see him back,  but this banning had <em>nothing to do with this thread</em>,  and we have enough drama in here without bringing it in from elsewhere.
<p></p>@Blue: Honestly,  most of the mods I've interacted with in threads are pretty cool.  They just seem short tempered because they spend most of their time dealing with forum drama.  Anyway,  I suggest we move on,  as it's kinda offtopic.

            I know something we can talk about. Remember when Echoax {The new guy} said that he wanted the bronycon docuementry to talk about the Rabid Brony's at some point? He's actually talking about the brony's who force the show on others,  make mlp fim comments on videos and other things that have nothing to do with the show,  and who get offended at every little thing that serves as even the smallest bit of criticism against the show. That's what he means when he talks about rabid brony's.

            <span class="blue">So this morning (I think) people were talking about why they became interested in the show to begin with.  I saw it pop up all over the forums here (though in those days I barely posted) and The Daily What,  a site I used to check every morning,  made a My Little Brony section for pony memes.  I started checking it out purely out of curiousity and wound up knowing all the characters and their basic personalities without having even seen the show.  So I decided to try it out.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Unlike most people I know of,  I actually was totally cool with the idea of becoming a fan of the show from the start,  but the initial episode did not hold my interest and I stopped watching,  only giving it a second try after several months had passed.</span>

            Rabid bronies you mean?  Yea anyone that gets so crazy about something that they feel the need to to force it down someone's throat is annoying.
<p></p>Im more like,  hey check this out its pretty cool.. and if they're like nah... its not my thing I leave it at that.
<p></p>My boyfriend actually got me into ponies by putting them on my tablet computer and I ended up watching them out of boredom.  I dont consider that throat rammy though.
<p></p>I did like Ponies from before though.  I have a box of G1-G3 ponies in my closet awaiting butchery.

            @Applelight: I don't like it either,  but let's not make matters worse by raging about it.  Yelling at the mods won't help his chances any.  Also,  don't get too angry; it's sounds like the "permanent" aspect of the ban might be the result of a miscommunication,  and Meta Four said he'd talk to Eddie about it.  In any case,  let's at least keep it out of this thread.
