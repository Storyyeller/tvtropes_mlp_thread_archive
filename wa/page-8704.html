            Ah,  I love thunderstorms!
<p></p>Surprisingly,  there were never any in Vancouver,  always just this sort of piddly light rain. It rains much better in Montreal,  and there's been a thunderstorm since I've been here already! Unfortunately,  I mostly slept through it... and then napped through the second stretch of rain in the afternoon.

            Well his first major CMOV is chapter 26,  so that's a lot less than halfway. It still isn't clear what his main plot is,  though it appears to involve uniting magical Britian into an unstoppable army.
<p></p>As for personalities
<ul><li> Harry's main goal is to use the power of Science to improve the world. He's frustrated by people who don't behave rationally and often lectures on pyschology. He's also read tons of scifi and fantasy books,  and tries to apply genre saviness. But he also has mischaveous childish moments,  like getting a throne and having his army hum the Imperial March from Star Wars.
</li><li> Hermione is the smartest and nicest,  but she quickly develops a friendly rivalry with Harry. She somtimes thinks in stories too and firmly beleives herself to be on the Good side and worries about Harry becoming the next Dark Lord. She isn't as devious as the others,  but she still gets her revenge when they underestimate her.
</li><li> Draco is sometimes arrogant and cruel as befitting a Malfoy,  but he is also worried about the idiots who have given Slytherin a bad name by just being jerks for the sake of it. Due to his tutoring from an early age,  he constantly thinks in plots,  but he appears to be genuinely warming up to Harry,  and is in the difficult position of trying to balance his friendship with Harry and his relatonship with Lucious.
</li></ul><p></p>I'm not very good at describing things,  but hopefully that was good enough.

            Well,  as I said,  the personalities of the main characters just don't sound appealing. <strong>NOTHING</strong> about the fic sounds appealing. I don't know why. I looked at the tropes and it just felt... wrong.
<p></p>It ain't even like FOE where certain things tickled my interest,  NOTHIING about MOR sounds interesting

            Writing takes the magic out of a story. At least the way I write.
<p></p>I can't write by the seat of my pants. I need to know EXACTLY what's happening and how. I need to plan it. Part of what I love about scheming in media is the reveal of the scheme. If I have to think of a scheme myself then the reveal is ruined since I KNOW it,  and exactly how it will be worded.

            @story there's just something inherant in the fic's very nature that just makes me not interested even in the tiniest possible way.
<p></p>None of the characters,  NONE of them,  sound likeable. Harry,  in fact,  sounds fucking obnoxious.
<p></p>I HATE blatant genre savviness and 4th wall leaning/breaking. Why do you think I didn't give a single FUCK about <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderOfTheStick" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a>?

            Personally,  I order Fish and Chips just to get the fish. French fries are disgusting. Also,  I once saw a place that served fish and chips with actual chips.
