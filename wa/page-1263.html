            Remember the part where the little girl in the fairy tale princess outfit said,  "But I wanted to be a zombie next year!" ? I know it was kind of a joke,  but can't you see that happening in real life? It does seem like the show's staff is trying to say something. After all,  one of the messages of this episode is "People (especially kids) love to be scared."

            It was more like that even if someone seems scary at first,  they still can be really nice people beneath.

<p></p>Though I think theres a difference between a quick and harmless fright and being actually scared. =/

            Oh right. Yeah,  I like how the show,  despite the target demographic,  doesn't fall to the cliche of being overly nasally(?) and such.
<p></p>As someone said before,  it doesn't undermine the kids intelligence so much it makes you want to shoot someone.

<p></p>Though it has,  of course,  toned down during the years,  but still prevails.
<p></p>Luna wasn't very perky untill the end of the episode. And not exactly "goth" apart from ethereal starry mane,  black coat,  cape made out of bats,  her personal guards being bat winged,  being the mistress of the night... OK,  she is kind of goth,  yeah. But the milder side and not the "hangs out in graveyards" type.
<p></p>Still,  I wouldn't be ready to pin the goth tag on Luna. Maybe it's just me.
<p></p>But she was clearly much happier at the end of the episode,  and of course when <strong>THE FUN HAD BEEN DOUBLED!</strong>

            I bet the bat thing was only because they are the most symbolic nocturnal animal. And a cape dissolving to owls would had looked weird.
<p></p>And pegasi normally have feathered wings,  and butterfly wings wouldn't really fit the princess of night.
<p></p>Apart from the bat thing,  what else was macarbe? I mean that Luna actually did on purpose.
<p></p>And I was <em>really</em> surprised of the Flutterabuse too. Even more so since Fluttershy's a girl.

            Well,  I can confirm that Call of the Cutie is also censored by Treehouse. Just saw the episode today,  and they censored a line near the end. When Silver Spoon says to Diamond Tiara "Whatever. We still think you're losers,  right,  Diamond Tiara?",  the line is censored so that it ends up as "Whatever. (silence),  right Diamond Tiara?". I may have mentioned this before,  but this is the same network that showed all the 11 Land Before Time movies there were back in 2006,  all of them uncensored,  including the first one. I guess they've been taking from South Park. "Horrific,  deplorable violence is OK,  as long as nobody says any naughty words!" That only leaves one more episode so far that I haven't seen that could possibly be censored on the network,  and that's Griffon the Brush-Off. Fortunately,  they somehow lightened up and are actually airing it on Wednesday,  so let's see how they butcher it there.

Someone should do Friends On The Other Side. I know it's already been done,  but I think it could be made a lot more awesome using footage from the new episode.
