            I was thinking about the role of the Princesses the other day.
<p></p>I don't think they actually raise the Celestial bodies. I think it's more symbolic,  maybe of the original Equestrian God-Empresses,  who did.
<p></p>Of course,  if word ever got out that the Sun and the Moon were actually uncontrolled,  Equestria would question the Princesses...

            I go with the FOE model. That it's not so much a direct,  must raise them every morning,  type thing,  but that they just give them a little nudge that keeps them both going in a constant pattern. That without them actaivly controlling them,  they would eventually,  as in centuries,  grow erratic,  or even stop.
<p></p>It's more like they wind the spring that keeps them ticking every day,  but the spring has enough winding to last a long time without it.

            Think about when Luna was banished.
<p></p>The Moon kept going. Celestia had to say that she was controlling both,  but the sheer energy needed would've exhausted her,  yet Celestia has always had at least some energy in her.
<p></p>I don't think Celestia can even lift the sun. She's insanely powerful,  sure,  but the Sun weighs a metric fuckton. If Celestia can lift the sun,  how couldn't she take down a bug full of holes?

            Again that's assuming that the sun there is the same as ours. It could be that sun is actauly a lot smaller,  and a lot closer,  and is actually orbiting the planet.

            I'm assuming that's only because it happened in the early night. The first episode took place from the hours of 10 PM to around 5 AM in my view.
<p></p>Nightmare's plan was to assimilate Celestia and the Element's power,  become the most powerful pony that ever lived,  then <em>destroy the sun.</em>
<p></p>To everypony,  it would <em>look</em> like Eternal Night...Except for the side of the world destroyed by the explosion...

            <div class="quoteblock">Equestria,  and the world it's part of,  is part of a Discworld</div>
<p></p>Eqestria is on a round planet. This has been demonstrated multiple times.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">An Introverted Pony I go with the FOE model. That it's not so much a direct,  must raise them every morning,  type thing,  but that they just give them a little nudge that keeps them both going in a constant pattern. That without them actaivly controlling them,  they would eventually,  as in centuries,  grow erratic,  or even stop</div>
<p></p>Lesson Zero shows that Celestia nudges the Sun along in small steps.
<p></p>The fact that Discord moves the sun and moon without moving the stars confirms that he's not just rotating the planet.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Think about when Luna was banished.
<p></p>The Moon kept going. Celestia had to say that she was controlling both,  but the sheer energy needed would've exhausted her,  yet Celestia has always had at least some energy in her. </div>
<p></p>When you can move the Sun,  adding the moon doesn't make a noticible difference.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I don't think Celestia can even lift the sun. She's insanely powerful,  sure,  but the Sun weighs a metric fuckton. If Celestia can lift the sun,  how couldn't she take down a bug full of holes? </div>
<p></p>By the bug full of holes being more powerful. Possibly capable of lifting <em>two</em> suns. Seriously. This isn't a difficult concept. I don't know why so few get it.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Again that's assuming that the sun there is the same as ours. It could be that sun is actauly a lot smaller,  and a lot closer,  and is actually orbiting the planet.</div>
<p></p>Unlikely as they have our constelations.
<p></p>How small do you want it to be anyway?
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">You'll note that the sun didn't rise during the Nightmare Solstice.</div>
<p></p>Indeed.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Nightmare's plan was to assimilate Celestia and the Element's power,  become the most powerful pony that ever lived,  then destroy the sun. </div>
<p></p>While this requires less power than moving it at the <em>speeds</em> they do,  it is still more difficult than moving it <em>at all</em>.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Given that the ordeal happened after Celestia was supposed to be revealed I kinda figured the second episode began at 'dawn'. </div>
<p></p>Indeed. They even said that they had been up all night.

            @Sereg Wait,  you're taking the movement of the sun during Twilight's psychotic break as canon evidence for how Celestia moves the sun? I think you really need to reconsider what is and isn't a cartoony exaggeration for the purposes of comedy.

            I don't want to kick off another one of these debates,  but I'm just going to point out:
<p></p>1. We have precisely zero frame of reference for how large the sun and moon are in relationship to the planet that Equestria is on,  or how much power it takes to move them.
<p></p>2. The sun moving in increments in Lesson Zero was rather obviously seen from Twilight's (warped) POV,  so we really can't take that as literal.  Especially since if we did,  it means that Celestia controls the windmill as well.
<p></p>3. Given that the ponies are capable of manipulating the sun and moon,  moving the stars around to match constellations isn't that weird.
<p></p>Although I do agree that Equestria is on a round world,  and that NMM was actively preventing the moon from rising.  Thing is,  Equestria being round doesn't really imply that any other aspect of its' cosmology resembles ours.  Given that the very first thing the show establishes about the setting is that the sun and moon don't move on their own,  I think we can safely say that pretty much it's entire astronomy works differently unless it's stated to be similar.

<p></p>Yes I am and will until another source gives me reason to suspect otherwise.
<p></p>Interestingly,  it was also that episode which demonstrated that Equestria' sun moves from West to East,  which was <em>confirmed in later episodes</em>.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I think you really need to reconsider what is and isn't a cartoony exaggeration for the purposes of comedy. </div>
<p></p>The reason for it is irrelevant. Superheros can do things because of the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule Of Cool</a>. No one claims that their abilities aren't real withing the contexts of their universes though. This is no different.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">1. We have precisely zero frame of reference for how large the sun and moon are in relationship to the planet that Equestria is on,  or how much power it takes to move them.</div>
<p></p>As I said,  throw out a reasonable weight limit and I'll do the calculations to see if that would work.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">2. The sun moving in increments in Lesson Zero was rather obviously seen from Twilight's (warped) POV,  so we really can't take that as literal.</div>
<p></p>While this is true,  it works perfectly well with what is known about the setting and is the best information we have.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Especially since if we did,  it means that Celestia controls the windmill as well.</div>
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">Point. But it wouldn't exactly be <em>hard</em> for her and <em>indirectly</em>? Yeah,  I can believe that.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">3. Given that the ponies are capable of manipulating the sun and moon,  moving the stars around to match constellations isn't that weird. </div>
<p></p>Some fanfic authors <em>do</em> portray Luna as capable of that. Peronally I think that assigning her galactic level abilities like that is a bit much based on what we know.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Thing is,  Equestria being round doesn't really imply that any other aspect of its' cosmology resembles ours.

<p></p>Their astronomy is actually remarkably similar to ours from what we've seen. Even their comets work the same way. Which would make the Sun being smaller than ours <em>incredibly</em> weird.

<p></p>You mean besides the sun moving smoothly and not in ticking increments in every other episode <em>as well as in Lesson Zero itself</em>?
<p></p>I honestly don't have a problem with your headcanon,  so long as you stop insisting that it is canon.
