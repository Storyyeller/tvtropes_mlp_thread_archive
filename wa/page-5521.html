<p></p>But the currency makes no sense. It should have subdivisions so that you can make change. It's absurd to charge 1 bit for a tomato,  because then the smallest possible price increment is to double the price!

            Yes Pinkie,  I am aware. First off,  it's not a bow tie. It's a bow and arrow. Second,  yes,  there are a bunch of stars there. However,  I'm referring to the myth behind the constellation. Is Orion a human?

<p></p>Some ponies spread a rumor that Twilight's brother is marrying a dragon who is secretly three ponies. But I think they're just mean meanieheads who want to make Twilight feel bad.

<p></p>We are Orz! Orz are happy *people energy* from the outside.
Inside is good. Six *pieces* myself did not even *smell* this *string*. It is so silly! It is such a *happy town*. And then the *pink bubbles* made a *slippery place* and Orz can *smell* it. Pushed the *fingers* into *new level* and there are so many *campers*. This is *everything story* you want to know.
