            Twilight and Applejack are the only ones I'd even consider,  and I'm leaning more towards AJ since she's usually more stable.  Maybe Twilight could be her vice president?

            I'd have to vote for Applejack because she is the Aspect of Honesty.  I could trust her to stick to her campaign promises,  unlike real politicians.
<p></p>Her work and family ethics are also very strong,  unlike real politicians :P
<p></p>I can forgive her for running away from home in The Last Roundup.

            I'm with you ilse,  tought call..now if we had them BOTH on the ballet,  best team EVER,  they each have there strenghts and flaws,  but the two would balance each other out perfectly.
<p></p>@JT nice review...as always...one thing though,  i DO think they were trying to VERY subtly show the Rarity and Pinkie's "assertive" methods were wrong,  yes they worked at first,  but when they each tried it on Iron Will later,  they failed,  only Fluttershy being truly assertive was what worked.

            You know,  the phrase "tastes like chicken" is really,  really cliched,  but turtle meat really <em>does</em> taste like chicken,  but with a more stringy texture.

            Twi would be good overall,  but she has a tendency to get to high strung and overreact. Where as AJ is the more dependably reliable one,  not as book smart,  but calmer. Team Twi's brain's with AJ's work ethic and levelheadedness,  perfect team.

            Ive actually owned a few turtles and tortoises
<p></p>My first two were ornate box turtles who unfortunately died young due to liver failure.  Whoever raised them as hatchlings fed them too much protein which damaged their livers and stunted their growth.  They both also had raging cases of pneumonia when I bought them,  let me tell you giving a turtle a penicillin shot is not easy!
<p></p>The last one I had was a Russian tortoise and I ended up giving her away to a girlscout troop for their mascot.  I wanted to keep her but I lived in an apartment and Russians are sorta like cows,  they like a lot of grass and forage in their diet to stay healthy and I used to keep her in an outdoor run in the warm weather so she could chow down,  once I moved to the apartment that wasnt possible so I gave her to someone who could provide the right kind of environment for her.
<p></p>I dont have any right now,  my boyfriend would kill me if I got another pet.  If I did get another it'd be a Ornate box again,  they have such great personalities.  The Russian,  was like a cow,  had very little interest other than eating.
