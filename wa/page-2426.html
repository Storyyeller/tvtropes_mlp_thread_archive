            @L Mage: I'll admit I don't follow it either,  but from what I remember 3000 was about as high as you got,  aside from a few insanely rare ones.
<p></p>And my concern with Twilight's effect is less the ability to use any spell effect - some oof which I believe instantly destroy monsters,  by the by - and more that every spell in the graveyard increases her basic attack. Like I said,  if you built a deck of spell cards with just enough monsters and trap to protect her,  maybe holding off on playing her for a while,  all the spells in your graveyard maker her insanely powerful. Like,  lets say you have 10 monsters in your deck,  and the rest are spell cards. Now that is feasibly enough to play a game on,  so that means she's got up to 40 spell cards to beef her up. At 100 points a card,  that's suddenly 4000 extra attack on top of what she's already got. It's a <em>very</em> slim possibility,  but it is a viable strategy,  and a pretty game-breaking one. Plus there's no limit on how many times she can use a spell card's effect,  so you could even build a ridiculous strategy around just her and two others - one spell that protects her,  and one that destroys an opponents monster.
<p></p>The theory behind it is sound - she's designed to be a quick use,  heavy-hitter character. She'd come in,  screw the enemy over a bit with some spells,  then get destroyed before she could do any real damage. Still a powerful and theoretically match winning card,  but not a broken one. It's just too easy to build a strategy that compliments her enough to make her a tank on the battlefield.
<p></p>I'm sorry if I seem harsh about this,  by the way,  but this is literally my job. It's like an architect seeing designs that they know would fall apart - even if the person making them is completely knew to it the first instinct is a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DopeSlap" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DopeSlap">Dope Slap</a>. I'm not <em>trying</em> to seem mean,  if that's how it's coming across.

It at least stops her from becoming a tank,  but it's still easy to manipulate the effect that is there to a drastic effect.

            Everyone has aspects of every color. I mean,  who's to say Jace (blue) doesn't lazily forget to fix his bed when he gets up in the morning sometimes (red),  or go out for a walk in the fresh air (green)? But he's blue because his <em>defining</em> traits are predominantly blue.
<p></p>Also,  while Rarity does leave some things scattered about in a fit of inspired creativity,  her home is otherwise pretty tidy.

            Rarity makes use of the passion (for her drama and HAM) and creativity (For her art) of Red quite a bit. The five colours shouldn't be flanderized by their most-seen battlemagic effects.

            I get what you're trying to say,  but blue expresses just as much creativity as red. They just have different forms of creativity. And while I don't doubt that she sometimes (or often,  I dunno) channels red in her work,  someone who's <em>predominantly</em> red sounds more like someone who's prolific,  but very hit-and-miss when it comes to making something that's actually considered good.
<p></p>When all is said and done,  Rarity won't stop until her final product is <em>perfect</em>. That doesn't sound like a red person at all.

<p></p>HA! What the author was trying to say. Gee I hate this concept.
<p></p>I remember one thing that happened in high school,  when we were analyzing <em>The Master &amp; Margaret</em> by Bulgakov. It was for... two? Three weeks? Three weeks I think we were listening to our teacher's delightful crap (she was not above giving our bad marks for opinions different from hers). Meanwhile I was doing some actual extensive research.
<p></p>One day I answered some random question about the symbolism and,  after hearing "This interpretation is wrong" replied "Funny part here being I just actually quoted Bulgakov himself on this." Then just rambled for fifteen or so about differences between what she said and what the author himself stated,  a bunch of examples of how people got bad marks for supposedly wrong but actually correct opinions,  et cetera,  et cetera,  concluding with "And you're the one who's being paid for this,  not me. Our education is a joke,  and you're the one telling it."
<p></p>She cried and ran out the class. I got a suspention. We got a new teacher. I was a hero for the rest of the year.

There was decorating of a tree and some drama over not finding the perfect gifts for each other.

            Claiming that a given interpretation is wrong is,  at best,  rather bigheaded. Implausible,  perhaps. Lacking in justification,  even. But unless someone is actually making a direct contradiction (and sometimes not even then),  it's hard to say that an interpretation is <em>wrong</em>.
<p></p>That said,  don't you think that was just a <em>bit</em> harsh,  fran? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin">

<p></p>Man JJ is a <em>machine</em>. I don't care that he uses the same templates and bodytypes repeatedly because that's the secret to his drawing speed,  and he's fast,  <em>funny</em>,  and draws cute girls <em>very</em> well,  so there.

Wasn't the first year she bugged me,  kind sir. You know how fun it is to be one of the worst literature students in my class,  despite knowing much more than my teacher does on various occasions,  as well as winning poetry contests every year?

            @fran,  you remind me of a girl I know in my film production course. She told us this story about how she once had a highly religious teacher in her Philosophy class. The teacher got on her nerves until one day,  her and her friends basically disproved the existence god to her face (or at least gave their best philosophical arguments) making the teacher cry and ultimately quit the job.
<p></p>I could never be that cruel to a teacher,  primarily because I've never had teacher who's gotten on my nerves. I've had <em>bad</em> teachers sure enough,  but I still like them too much as people to ever wilingly hurt his feelings
<p></p>I'm a very soft person basically. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16"> Willingly being cruel is not my strong suit

            Most of the teachers I've had in Singapore are actually pretty decent,  only the curriculum is a mite demanding. My accounts teacher was actually a great referee and even took part in some major FIFA matches!
<p></p>Cheerilee needs to see to it that Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon don't go too far in tormenting her students.
<p></p>Maybe we might see a future episode where Twilight has to tutor some of the foals or help out with Cheerilee's class?

That's one piss poor philosopher. The students are arguably even worse.
