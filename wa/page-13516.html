            <span class="blue">I finally got to see Games Ponies Play.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">I really liked it,  one of the top episodes of the season at least.  I really like that they're setting things up for future episodes.  The Equestrian Games have to take place in Season 4,  I bet they originally planned for it to be in this season but when they shortened it to 13 episodes they changed it up.  Actually,  this episode really felt to me like part 1 of a 2 part finale,  with the focus on the entire cast,  the higher than usual production values,  the Big Event set up,  and the guest star characters (Shiny was great).</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">I <em>didn't</em> like the green haired ponies accent or manner of speaking,  I find that sort of bad fake southern affectation really grating.  But the character herself I found interesting.  I didn't expect claustrophobia to show up in this show.  I assumed with the way they she kept going on about wanting to run and stretch her legs that they were leading up to the reveal that she was actually an athlete competing in the games,  but that didn't happen.  I wonder if it was initially planned but they decided the plot was complicated enough.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Best part: Twilight's legitimate character development.  She was put into a position where she was in charge of a job that went bad... and she <em>didn't go crazy.</em> She even realized that this was unusual herself when she was talking to her brother,  and it was really good to see her practicing the relaxation technique Cadance taught her throughout the episode.  It leads very well into</span> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the season finale.  It would be a bad idea to have a princess who can't cope with stress,  and she's now shown that she's gotten good at handling it.</span>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> BTW Do we learned new town/city name in this episode? Mustangia? </div>
<p></p><span class="blue">I thought it was a province/country but maybe it's a town.</span>

            @Applelight: As much as I'm not a fan of the idea,  I think we should wait until we have more than one frame (that appears to be more of a test frame than anything else) before claiming anything about the quality.   If the original show can take something girly and make it palatable,  it's possible (however unlikely) that they might be able to take the whole "High School AU" thing and make something decent out of it.  Sure,  it's a bit of a long shot,  but let's not throw the whole thing under the bus before it airs.
<p></p>That,  and the body types is one of those things that's going to please <em>no one</em> so they made it the same so that it isn't an important part of the episode.

The only reason they didn't was because it was cheaper.  I'd also say that model reuse is way more noticeable with humans since we're more familiar with what they should look like.

            I dunno,  I may sound a bit crazy,  but I think this could have potential. They could try to avert the usual high-school type shows and do their own spins with it. The only thing that confuses me is the technicolor skin,  unless it's for the same reason homestuck characters are monochrome.

<p></p>@Bluespade: Southern? That sounded like a northern accent to me. Something Minnesota-ish.

            If this is a story about them being highschoolers,  then I wonder if they will have a human version of Cheerilee be one of the teachers,  to keep with her usual role,  or if she will be a classmate of theirs since she's probably the same age as Rarity in the main show (since she showed up as one of Rarity's classmates in the Cutie Mark Chronicles flashback).

            Really,  if they get inventive about it they could find new roles for the characters. Like Celestia could be the principal,  Luna could be a teacher,  Iron Will could be the gym teacher,  Trixie could be like a cheerleader or something.

            In regards to Equestria Daily's <a class="urllink" href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/2013/02/episode-followup-games-ponies-play_10.html">episode followup<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  it made me realize something about <a class="urllink" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ell0hFsZ0qk/URcyQrjyILI/AAAAAAAAAfg/eud46U1PAJo/s1600/vlcsnap-2013-02-09-21h36m05s206.png">this scene<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small>. Rainbow Dash didn't break the roof! Rarity was probably thinking the whole time "Huh,  that sounded like Rainbow Dash...but there's no property damage... can't be her..."
<p></p>As for the supposed TV movie screenshot,  nothings really confirmed yet and it could still be a hoax. That said,  the reason most ponies have the same body type in the show is to make it easier for the animators,  there are <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a> to draw &amp; animate after all.
<p></p>I think I said before that my main problem with this if it turned out to be real wouldn't necessarily be the High School setting but the fact its not <strong>ponies</strong>. Imagine if they did a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolAU" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolAU">High School AU</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a> as humans!
<p></p>...Actually,  that might be <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">hilarious</a> <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            IDK I'd like to see the CMC as middle schoolers. As for Rarity,  I always assumed she's a few years older than the others,  explaining her sense of professionalism. So Cheerilee's probably in her very early twenties; just on her second or third year of teaching.

            @Blue: Basically,  it's not confirmed,  but there have been multiple rumors from multiple sources. I'm still taking it with a grain of salt but after the <em>last</em> big spoiler,  I wouldn't put it past them.
<p></p>Also,  I think it's important to keep in mind that as far as we know this is a one-shot thing.  There haven't been any hints of them making a whole show of this anyway,  so we have no idea.
