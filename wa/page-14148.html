            How did I first get into the show?  I've been a fan of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a> in general since I was at least 4,  but it's actually more complicated than that.  When I read about it,  I wasn't sure about it at first because of the "Twilight learns to socialize more and stop studying so much" thing that gets mentioned in the first episode (I was afraid it would portray being smart as a bad thing,  which it luckily doesn't do most of the time) but it did sound like an interesting new version of the show from what I read about it on this site.  I also was wary about the idea that the nighttime sister was the "villain" but was relieved to learn that Luna turns good and isn't inherently evil (I like how she's turned into <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Dark Is Not Evil</a> as the show has gone on,  like in Luna Eclipsed or when she helps Scootaloo).  The first episode I tried out was Applebuck Season,  which sounded the most interesting to me when I read what it was about,  and I ended up really liking it,  especially after the scene where she and Pinkie make the "baked bads."  I then looked up the other episodes and watched through the rest of the first season.  I think I joined the fandom around sometime between the first and second seasons,  too.

            For me,  it was the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SFDebris" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SFDebris">SF Debris</a> review of the pilot episode that was the first time I actually noticed the show,  checked out the page here,  saw just how huge it was,  and that it was all available (at the time) on youtuube,  sat down to watch it,  went from,  "this is pretty damn good" to "Damn this is good" "To holy fuck this show is amazing" and next thing I knew,  by the time I was done with season one I was hooked.

            For me it was seeing lots of ponies on the net and being told it was good there. Decided I may as well check it out. First episode I had to wait for was Owls Well that Ends Well. But I only got <em>really</em> into it at the beggining of season 2.

            I,  myself got a little curious a bit,  and asked a friend who <em>used</em> to be a fan that I might give it a shot.  First attempt with Party of one kinda did <em>not</em> stick to me.  I likely was a bit <em>too</em> cynical at the time,  but as time went on,  I grew more idealistic,  and went up to the same individual.  "Zack?"  I asked.  "I'd like to give it another shot."  Cue me getting the series premier,  and promptly liking the series from there on out.
<p></p>I'm guessing I learned a little bit about myself,  that I wasn't exactly the kind of guy who would dig the stories that got right to in media res (For the uninitiated,  it's being introduced to a story from the middle of it all).  Granted the episodes could stand out on their own,  I kinda thought it was necessary to learn of the basis of the characters <em>before</em> the action kicked up.
<p></p>If there's other details pertaining to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</a> you want to know,  whether it's my story or other such details,  feel free to shoot questions or look at the folder dedicated to ponies on page.

            Yeah I got into it over the weekend break between Lesson Zero,  and Luna Eclipsed. Well that wa when I started watching it,  wasn't really hooked till the weekend LE aired,  and by the time of Sisterhooves,  I was watching it on the livestream.

            I mostly watched it first on a whim - I saw CR's 'Pinkie Pie in five seconds',  thought it looked kinda funny,  and decided to give it a watch. that was the week just before episode 15 of Season 1 came out,  and I'd gone through all of the time episode 16 aired.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Literally the first episode. I've heard a lot of people say that they really don't like it,  or didn't at the time,  but I loved it right from the get go. I even liked the theme song.

            It all started when I started seeing pony sprays whenever I played <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamFortress" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamFortress">TF2</a>.  I remember one of them was a picture of the Last Supper,  but with the character's heads photoshopped in place of the apostles'.  Then,  I ended up seeing a video that took the audio from a Starcraft 2 trailer and used clips from the show for the visuals and I thought,  "Huh.  This actually looks like it has some action in it."  I also remember that at the time I thought it was just a TV special instead of a show.
<p></p>Then,  I saw the clip of Flutterguy singing and I thought to myself,  "Okay,  I have to watch this,  if only to see the context for that."  Since I prefer watching things in order,  I watched all the episodes before that before watching it.  Then I continued watching,  eventually coming to the most recent episode,  and when I tried watching the next one (Cutie Mark Chronicles),  I found out it hadn't aired yet.  Then as I waited for it to air,  I officially became a fan.

            The turning point for me was actually the third episode.  They started that chase sequence and then I was like,  "Wait,  is that Yackety Sax?  That's hilarious!"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            I don't know the actaul turning point,  it was a gradual thing,  but if I'd have to give one,  it was either Winter Wrap Up,  especially the song,  or RD doing the Sonic Rainboom.

            For me,  the first time I heard about the show was seeing this youtube video while browsing: <center><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="425" height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0bjkM_y-Wps?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p></p>I thought that it was a little more exiting than I would expect from MLP,  but I was unaware of the fanbase until I saw pony avatars all over the web. I got curious about what they were about,  did some digging and learned about the fandom,  and pointed it out to my brother. He quickly became a brony,  along with a number of his freinds,  and that just made me have to see what all the fuss was about.
<p></p>Once I reached Dragonshy I was loving the show,  though it wasn't until about Party Of One that I was comfortable watching something 'girly'. By then,  I found this thread and many fan sites by proxy,  so I was most definitely a fan.

            I think it was a combination of seeing pony avatars everywhere here and seeing the Skyrim trailer at my videogame club.
<p></p>But unlike most people,  I started with <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverABarrel" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverABarrel">Over A Barrel</a>. The Fluttertree scene and the Horse Drawn Horse Drawn carriages sold me,  though it wasn't until I had watched 5 more episodes that I realized I was really hooked.

            Change point for me?  Well...  going technically from not fan to fan,  it'd be the series premiere,  where I got to learn a fair bit about the characters and their quirks.  (Might have some connection as to why I have a hard time choosing favorite background pony,  but I digress.)  The moment that made me into a fairly devoted follower would probably be Bridal Gossip.  (I <em>still</em> feel bad for Fluttershy,  not to mention the others.
