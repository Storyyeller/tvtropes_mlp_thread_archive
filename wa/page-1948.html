            On a less negative note,  were any <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorMoon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a> fans reminded of the story where Minako tries to go on two dates at once and is running to and from both?  Because that's what I thought of when I saw Rarity doing that with the two parties.

            Aw... I'm sorry. But it's not really true; just because I can come up with an idea doesn't mean nobody can come up with something better. I'm pretty sure you've come up with stuff I've liked enough to add to my headcanon before.

            So we can add Rapidfire and Fleetfoot to the list of known Wonderbolts. Judging by their names it's quite likely Rapidfire is Spitfire's brother.
<p></p>With all the abuse Opal gets in this episode it's no wonder she's so cantankerous when she has to put up with Rarity.
<p></p>You know I think Rainbow Dash would be kind of happy that Rarity said she was the Wonderbolts trainer.

            How come the fact that Twilight is Celestia's personal student from Canterlot never comes up?  Rarity could have easily used that very true fact to impress the snobs and she wouldn't have had to lie about Rainbow Dash being the Wonderbolts' "trainer" (although,  to be fair,  Rainbow Dash would probably be flattered if she knew).

            There's also the issue that RD won the best young fliers competition.
<p></p>I could see her maybe not wanting to talk about Pinkie or AJ,  but Fluttershy was once a very popular and famous model,  and Even AJ is the forerunner of an apparantly very wide business of apple orchards. Her friends are almost all people to be very proud of knowing.

            I really liked today's episode,  then again Rarity episodes are best episodes. It does confirm a few interesting things.
<p></p><ul><li> Apparently Canterlot gentry (or the whole of the Equestrian upper class) are so self-absorbed that they can't even recognize important national heroes.
</li><li> I think we can assume that while Twilight was in Canterlot Celestia probably insulated her from most of the upper class snobery.
</li></ul><p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">It seems Rarity was more concerned about their behavior then anything else. Also maybe The Best Young Fliers competition isn't very big outside of Cloudsdale and pegasi communities. I assume the only reason the Canterlot gentry even know who the Wonderbolts are is because they  perform for them on a regular basis.

Although it's only natural that Rarity would want to come up with the best explanation possible.  I can kinda understand why Fluttershy didn't come up; she was only famous for a really brief period of time before disappearing from the public eye,  so it's possible that they might not have remembered her.

Thus explaining why the princesses don't speak like that.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">

            Alternatively,  it's something that's sprung up - I mean naturally,  rather than for style reasons - sometime in the last thousand years,  and Celestia keeps her old accent because,  frankly,  she's the ruler of the freaking country and gets to speak in whatever accent she damn well pleases.

            The lack of Spike in this episode is what confused me the most. Are they seriously telling us he wouldn't be there for his Sister/mother/friend's birthday party? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            Just finished watching the new episode.
<p></p>I'm going to go on record and say that it is my favourite so far in this series after Lesson Zero.  Really,  it was brilliant.  Fantastic.
<p></p>And I loled at the party cannon...oh how I loled. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>And just one more thing...that beret and sweater outfit Rarity was wearing...confound her...she drives me to naughty thoughts...
<p></p>Edit: Some have mentioned that the Rarity episodes are the best.  I heartily agree.  Look Before You Sleep,  Suited for Success,  Dog and Pony Show,  Green Isn't Your Colour,  Sisterhood Social and now Sweet And Elite...all gems.

<p></p>If Spike were out on business,  I don't think she would've mentioned it unless Rarity asked. So I'll go with that one <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">
