<p></p>Okay,  that's an <em>extreme</em> oversimplification of religious faith (which contrary to popular belief is <em>not</em> mutually exclusive with science),  but literally the last thing I want right now is a religious arguement,  so I'll let it slide.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>Anyway,  episodes I'd like in season 2:
<p></p><ul><li>A CMC episode that focuses on characterization for the members of the group instead of "Cutie mark shenanigans"
</li><li>Another episode where Pinkie learns the lesson.  She gets off too easy.
</li><li>Oddly enough,  I wouldn't mind another Applejack episode either,  even though she isn't really my favorite pony.

            It's kind of odd how racism in pony society is consistently shown. Twilight calls Applejack "stubborn as a mule",  and Rarity breaks down crying at being called a mule. And everyone in Ponyville was afraid to interact with a zebra.
<p></p>This is consistent with the <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess"> that Equestria is Houyhnhnmland.

            @Teeth: I know,  I know,  that's why I said it was mean. One of my neighbors was a biblical <em>scholar</em>,  for goodness sake. It was  just a joke,  I'm sorry.
<p></p>I'd sort of like to see the girls sort of,  paired off by race for an episode per group - just because I think the dynamic would be interesting,  and we don't really see them interacting as small groups enough,  I don't think.
<p></p>Oh lord,  I can imagine an episode dedicated to Rarity trying to give Twilight a makeover. Moral: It's nice to do a friend a favour,  but sometimes they <em>don't want it</em>.

            ^^Didn't she already do that during the sleepover with Applejack?
<p></p>^I wouldn't call Pinkie a Sue; she's just so spacey that she doesn't really get taught any lessons.  And to be honest,  <em>most</em> of the characters that do learn lessons learn things like 'stop being so accomodating' or 'don't try to do everything yourself',  rather than lessons that address character flaws.

            They also need some episodes focusing on character pairings they haven't really shown yet.  Like Applejack and Fluttershy,  or Rarity and Pinkie Pie,  or Rainbow Dash and Trixie.

            <div class="quoteblock"> They also need some episodes focusing on character pairings they haven't really shown yet. Like Applejack and Fluttershy,  or Rarity and Pinkie Pie,  or Rainbow Dash and Trixie. </div>
I recall "Dragonshy" had some cute Rarity + Pinkie Pie moments.  Maybe I'll re-watch that one.

            <div class="quoteblock">And to be honest,  most of the characters that do learn lessons learn things like 'stop being so accomodating' or 'don't try to do everything yourself',  rather than lessons that address character flaws.</div>
<p></p>I don't think it's so much a matter of being accommodating as - you're talking about Green Isn't Your Color,  right? - <em>speaking up for yourself</em>.  That's the lesson.  Fluttershy's major flaw has always been that she's too timid to stand up for herself and tell people what she thinks and I don't think it even comes down to being "accommodating" or not except in an indirect sense.  And Rarity in that episode was being largely disingenuous - the reason she didn't want to tell Fluttershy to stop wasn't out of any desire to be accommodating,  but rather because she was aware of her petty jealousy and wanted to pretend she wasn't,  so for her it was a lesson about honesty.
<p></p>The point about Applejack's lesson is a point,  though.  Actually,  in her other big episode,  she had a real lesson to learn,  but it was kind of a minor one next to... er... Rarity.
<p></p>Wow,  Rarity's actually kind of a bitch.

            @Turnways: I'd actually forgotten about "Green Isn't Your Color" - I was referring to "Suited For Success". Anyway,  I think the point holds that usually the lessons the mane cast learn relate to a good trait being taken too far - like humility in "Boast Busters",  or somesuch - rather than a bad trait. Aside from Pinkie,  whose character is balanced on account of being the resident physics-breaking cuckoolander,  every one of the main six seem like a pretty balanced mix of positive and negative traits,  and even Pinkie has trouble listening and/or being focused.
<p></p>Also: I will allow you a pass for now,  but those are fighting words.
