            @Ginger: Um...I can't really see how <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks">Hard Work Hardly Works</a> when <em>she worked her plot off to get where she is</em>.  As for the "magic is her special talent" thing,  it's a chicken and egg thing,  she got that cutie mark because she was passionate about music.  It's like complaining that Fluttershy is the best with animals because she has a special talent for it and spends all her time around animals.  I'm not exactly sure what you <em>want</em> Twilight's power level to be at.  She fully deserves to be as powerful as she is because she's spent her whole life honing that skill.  If Twilight had <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift">The Gift</a> but didn't put that effort in,  she'd be <em>nowhere</em> near as skillful as she is.

What he is arguing is that even with all of the work she has done she wouldn't be able to accomplish half of the things she has done if it weren't for her high magical potential,  apparently the highest of any unicorn.

Now that might be the case here,  but just because you have a natural affinity for something doesn't at all mean that she's going to be awesome at it without learning or practicing.

            @Ginger I say,  yes she could.
<p></p>Again,  her passion,  the thing that she spent her life working on,  was magic in all its forms.
<p></p>When has she gone into a white-eyed trance since childhood,  when she wasn't hooked up to a power much greater than her own? Never. If she ever had some nebulous reserve of "potential" power,  it's been long since dwarfed by the sheer amount of work she's put into learning and refining the skill. What does "raw magic" mean? I rather think that it's just that as a filly,  her magical abilities were highly visible and untamed,  at least in that flare of magic.
<p></p>Again,  it's only because she put just about all her time into the practice that she'd been able to reach her current level with all the spells she has. As another example of a unicorn who puts her time into a specific area of study,  look at Trixie. She couldn't fight the Ursa because she didn't focus on magic for fighting things. Her focus,  her passion,  is towards performance and illusion. And because she focuses on that,  she's also had time to work on her stage presence and charisma.

            Yeah. I think she saw that she,  eitehr mentally or physically,  had some affinity for magic that needed to be worked on from a young age.
<p></p>Strangely,  it wasn't until a day before the <span class="strike">Grave Eclipse</span> longest day of the 1000th year that she remembered that Twilight also needed to be able to make friends with other people to fully realize the power of that element.

            Thing is,  this is just SUCH an easy thing to fix. Simple. Remove one line. One. Line. and Twilight would be my favourite character in the entire show. (trumping even Applejack)

            <div class="quoteblock">Okay,  that makes sense. Thing is,  I'm not sure I buy into the assumption that Cutie Mark = excellence. It means that they enjoy it,  and are better than average,  but not necessarily that they're the best at it. Now that might be the case here,  but just because you have a natural affinity for something doesn't at all mean that she's going to be awesome at it without learning or practicing.</div>
<p></p>It was never about her Cutie Mark. It was about that freaky display of magic she demonstrated in CMC. The implication seems to be that she had some hidden "magical reserve" or what not that no other Unicorn does. In essences she is not better because she worked for it (not to say that she hasn't) but because she was born with more power.

            Twilight may have started with huge amount of potential power,  but it wouldn't have mattered in the slightest if she hadn't spent years working at it.  The ability to occasionally freak out and turn your parents into cacti isn't the most useful of skills.  Without all her hard work those massive power reserves would have been useless at best and actively harmful at worst.

A very pretty turn of phrase,  very inspiring,  especially when said to a young child,  especially especially one who moments ago was afraid she didn't have any talent,  and even sooner ago,  was apologizing for the magic she'd just displayed.
<p></p>You may even say it's exactly what Twilight would have wanted to hear.
<p></p>How shrewd.

            @Crowfall: Exactly.
<p></p>Having a lot of skill in something doesn't mean much if you never <em>use</em> that skill.  You can have more skill at being a quarterback than any other person on the planet and you'll still lose every game if you don't practice.
<p></p>Other thing is,  Celestia was referring to Twilight's <em>potential</em> for greatness.  Potential can be wasted.  Sure she may have more potential than any other unicorn,  but unless she studies,  it doesn't mean jack squat.

<p></p>If that is so,  Twilight might be reading books from our world.

            My comment about her being shrewd,  half-serious though it is,  still stands. I'm sure there is at least some exaggeration there. After all,  what about Luna?
