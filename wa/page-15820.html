If it's red and white,  remember to stand on it and press up and down on your d-pad to move it. Otherwise you'll be stuck in that room forever.

            I like writing in cursive,  my stories all start off in a notebook,  and I carry around a little pocket notebook and pen everywhere I go.  Sure I could use a phone for such things but it has a style all its own and a permanence that an electronic device can't match.  Not that anyone can read my handwriting as it tends to skip some steps to become a slow shorthand. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            My handwriting is bascially print except that I often connect letters when writing fast.
<p></p>What's weird is that when I first started school I Was taught in cursive,  then I moved to a different school and it was all print,  and then in third grade they tried to teach us cursive by which point I had basically forgotten it all. Of course cursive is completely useless nowadays anyway.

            Hey speaking of typing,  I wonder how hard it would be to learn Dvorak. I think a normal keyboard could be configured to use Dvorak,  but the problem would be getting past the hunt and peck stage when you can't see the keys.

            I'm back online and feeling refreshed from my snooze,  sorry you guys had to witness that I have had summer heat for the last couple of days even though it's early September for god sakes. Now I'm feeling fine and there will be no more loopy things coming out of my mouth so ya don't need to worry about. Anyways I'm gonna watch the new part added to the Hellfirecomms playthrough of KH DDD and put my shirt back on cuz I have had it off while I've been posting through the trying conditions. And as you've all gathered I don't do well in the heat.

            I had to do a cursive writing thing for work once. Four hours of writing in cursive,  which I hadn't done since like,  5th grade... my hand was cramped as <em>hell</em> afterwords. Could barely move my ring and pinkey finger. On the bright side,  according to the person taking care of it,  my handwriting is very 'pretty'.
<p></p>I prefer typing because no matter how much I write I don't cramp that bad. And as far as looking at the keyboard goes,  I don't strictly <em>need</em> to,  but I tend to do it out of habit. I find the keys out of muscle memory,  but if I don't look at the keyboard then I start to second-guess myself,  even though I'm aware that I don't really <em>see</em> the keys even when I do look at them. Habits,  I guess.

            Wow Huey from The Boondocks is right the heat really DOES make you mad. But then again this is what happens when you try to post like normal it's not a good idea to do that when your hot. But then again we all do stupid things when we are hot. Alright note to self: Don't ever do that again I vote that we all think that it was a dumb moment altogether and never speak of it again.
