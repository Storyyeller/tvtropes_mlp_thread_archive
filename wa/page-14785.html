            Sort of sounds like how my whole day's been,  Apple.  Thankfully I'm breaking  up the routine by going to a midnight showing of the Shining at a local cinema.  Right now I'm drinking some rum and really wishing I had something to go with it.

            I think a lot of it comes from the flanderization they get from the Lord of the Rings,  but the Silmarillion shows quite another side to them.
<p></p>Yes they are harmonious creatures,  but they're also in perfect sink with their darker emotions. Just look what happened with Feanor and his line. Genocidal kin-slaying,  the kickstarter for the biggest war in Middle-earth's history,  and all because of being jealous for his greatest work of art.

            @Sereg: I'm thread hopping,  so I'm assuming here,  but if you're talking about the trend of flipping the bird to elves by pointing out for all their ideas of being the superior culture,  they're in the same sort of society as everyone else,  looking at their culture like that almost kind of makes them look even <em>more</em> arrogant. If they consider their society superior because they simply have different values - as is obvious,  really - well,  <em>every</em> culture values different things,  and would therefore sort of consider their culture to be the best because it's what <em>they</em> value. The elves are just the only ones who go waving their cultural <em>cocks</em> around about it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They're like the America of fantasy</span>

            Eh,  in my experience the french just kind of try to keep their culture from getting 'tainted'. They don't really prance about showing it off.
<p></p>Largely because they don't give a shit about what us filthy anglos care,  I guess.
<p></p>Of course my main experience with the french is actually the Quebecois,  which is a bit different,  so I dunno.

            @Sereg: K-7.
<p></p>@Kegisak: I might be biased,  being an American and all,  but I don't think that's the best example.  A lot of Americans are like that not because they view their culture as being better for no good reason,  but because they view it as being more practical,  or at least less persnickety.  Like people who say American food is better aren't saying it's better solely because it's American,  but because they view it as being less pointlessly gussied.  I.e. they'll think a hamburger and fries is better than a fancy steak medallion or whatever because they it doesn't need all the pretense and whatever.
<p></p>Think of the difference between AJ and Rarity's approach to smores.  Rarity looks down on AJ's method because it's uncouth and messy,  and AJ doesn't like Rarity's method because she thinks it's needlessly finicky.  AJ would be the American.
<p></p>France is... kinda on a fence. On one hand,  the (perceived) tendency to try to keep their culture free of outside influence makes them come across as snobby with whole "we can't let our culture be tainted!" thing.
<p></p>America is almost the opposite way; we'll take just about anything and sort of co-opt it.

            Okay,  I probably should have pointed this out then,  but I <em>was</em> mostly making a joke. You know,  playing off the stereotype. I realize that joke had the potential to offend and confuse,  etc. etc.
<p></p>That said,  that does kind of run in line with my point. Simply being more practical isn't necessarily a point in it's favour. Many of the cultures that a practical person would consider silly simply put that emphasis on appearance,  because they have extremely deep and artistic cultures. Yes,  an inch-wide piece of Steak Bleu an a single asparagus seems quite silly,  yes,  but to a frenchman that mean is art,  in and of itself. IT's different values. An American values simplicity and practicality,  but not all cultures do. Just because you have a <em>reason</em> why you consider your culture better doesn't necessarily mean you aren't being assumptive if you go around <em>telling</em> people it's better.

            So you're using smores as a metaphor for cultural posturing between the American and French ways of life as a comparison of the elves? Which has what to do with ponies aside from Rarity and AJ?

            @Kegisak: Oh I wasn't saying that America is <em>right</em>.  They're still wrong,  just for a different reason than you said.  Part of the American arrogance is that they think they're right because they think have a better reason than other cultures.
<p></p>That <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> was kind of my point.  Both cultures look at each other with disdain,  and when they do,  they're <em>both</em> wrong.  It's back to the AJ and Rarity thing.  They both have valid points,  but they treat their points like they're the <em>only</em> points that matter.

            @Kegi: Depending on the fantasy setting that's how elves act about their culture too. I guess I say France because it is a culture actually look up too and consider good,  while American culture is viewed. . .less favorably to say the least.

            Right,  I agree with that,  yeah. Any sort of cultural exchange must be just that - compare,  contrast,  and see what you can take from it. LBYS could actually be taken as a guide for international diplomacy - AJ learns that stopping to observe and plan can be useful,  even if it's not for aesthetic senses,  and Rarity learns sometimes you must simply leap in and get yourself dirty,  even if it's not for the sake of manual labour. Take what you can appreciate,  leave what you don't need.

<p></p>You're right to make the smore comparison though.
<p></p>@Dark: There's a reason I love <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSilmarillion" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a> so much.
<p></p>@Kegi: It's not about thir culture being "better". It's about it being "different" because evn their biologys very different from ours. The thread I mentioned introduced a concept I love called "long time". Elves are normally in long time. Their ability to interact with the orld is slowed considerably but this keeps them comfortable and healthy. When stressed,  they can switch to short time which is how most other races interact with the world,  but it's unpleasant. And  interacting maningfully with a member of another race <em>requires</em> short time. The reason the elf acts as though your presence is giving him a headache is because it <em>is</em>. (The unpleasant effets of short time <em>can</em> be mitigated with effort though.)

            Huh... that's actually a really interesting concept,  actually.
<p></p>I've been reading <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WheelOfTime" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WheelOfTime">Wheel of Time</a> lately,  and from what I can tell the Ogiers(thing trolls with a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb">Green Thumb</a>) work kind of similarly - they seem to experience time much differently,  because the Ogier they meet considers having waited <em>three years</em> for his village elders to allow him to leave before just kind of peacing out on them to have been extremely hasty. I mean,  there's the simple perception of time being different depending on how long you've lived,  but he's only about 70,  and I doubt a 70 year old person would regard three years as the equivalent of a few weeks. So I imagine for him being around people is quite stressful because of how hectic they must seem. Like talking to a dozen children all on sugar highs.

            To be fair,  practicality would be superior back in the day. It's just we've long since passed the threshold where jacking around being impractical would jeopardize peoples' futures or lives (granted,  it still can,  but usually just in serious excess).
<p></p>I don't think a hamburger and fries makes a good example,  though. Sure,  they're typically faster in terms of raw speed,  but unless one is going out of their way to get the healthier stuff,  their nutritional value is going to be pretty awful and if eaten too regularly,  possibly a long-term problem.

            @Kuroi: I was talking less about health or the practicality of making it and more about presentation. A hamburger is one of those things where you just sort of stack everything,  dump the fries on the plate and as long as you can eat it,  you're good,  as opposed to fancier cuisine with a heavy emphasis on presentation and taking the time to organize the elements of the dish.
