            <div class="quoteblock">@Sereg Just remember that there is equally no evidence of your interpretation either,  and I don't consider it to be the simplest explanation given the evidence of when she has demonstrated her powers.</div>
<p></p>There <em>is</em> evidence,  just evidence that few others <em>accept</em>. Not the same thing as <em>no</em> evidence. They have the same constellations as us and their commets work the same way. I see no problems when Celestia is using her powers,  but whatevs. Do I admit that may explanation may be completely incorrect? Sure! But at <em>the moment</em> I consider it most likely. I mean,  my power estimates have changed <em>often</em> (always upwards so far).
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">@Sereg: It is relevant when you're comparing a d20/pathfinder character to one from GURPS or Exalted or something. Or a Ogre Battle Tactics hero to someone from FF Tactics (War of the Lions) and to someone from FF Tactics A2 (Grimoire of the Rift). </div>
<p></p>Why? You just have to convert the stts from game system to real world. For example,  it's genually accepted that a starting Exalted chracter is<em>roughly</em> as powerful as a level 15 <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DnD" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DnD">Dn D</a> character.
<p></p>Let me put it this way,  what would it take,  that doesn't involve out of characterness or show inapropriatness,  that would make you guys decide that my estimtion of power sounds about accurate? (I know what it would take for me to drop my power estimtion).
<p></p>EDIT: <div class="quoteblock">What I'm saying is that Sereg is comparing the raw numbers for characters from completely different series running on different rules without "standardizing" their stats for proper proportionate balancing lol.

<p></p>I'm doing nothing of the sort.

            <div class="quoteblock">All fiction must be treated equally or you start going,  "I shot you!",  "Nuh uh!"</div>
<p></p>Um,  no.  This isn't true <em>at all</em>.  Each work of fiction must be treated in accordance with it's own established set of rules.  It's why you don't judge a superhero book movie by the same way you'd judge historical fiction.  If I watch <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lincoln" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lincoln">Lincoln</a> and Abe starts flying around halfway through,  I'm going to call BS,  but if <em>Superman</em> does it I'll be fine with it because <em>the two movies rely on totally different sets of rules</em>.
<p></p>Honestly,  I think part of the reason this argument keeps coming up is because we're trying to compare two things and can't agree on what's an apple and what's an orange.
<p></p>As far as I'm concerned,  Equestrian physics simply don't always agree with real world physics,  and where the two contradict,  I'm willing to handwave it with "Eh,  pony physics are different".
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">There is evidence,  just evidence that few others accept. Not the same thing as no evidence.</div>
<p></p>Sereg,  the reason this keeps coming up is because <em>if people don't accept something as evidence it means they don't consider it to be evidence in the first place</em>.  You're saying "There is evidence,  but you don't accept it" while everyone else is saying "but it's <em>not</em> evidence".  Phrasing it that way is making it sound like you're saying "I'm right,  and everyone else just doesn't <em>get</em> it".  We are disagreeing with your assertion that evidence exists,  or at the very least claiming that such evidence is insufficient to base any solid claims off of.  I'm not saying that you're interpretation of the setting is <em>wrong</em>,  but it's not any more plausible than anyone else's take on it.

            <div class="quoteblock">Um,  no. This isn't true at all. Each work of fiction must be treated in accordance with it's own established set of rules. It's why you don't judge a superhero book movie by the same way you'd judge historical fiction. If I watch Lincoln and Abe starts flying around halfway through,  I'm going to call BS,  but if Superman does it I'll be fine with it because the two movies rely on totally different sets of rules.</div>
<p></p>Not the same thing. You are calling BS because he <em>shouldn't be able</em> to fly. You're still accepting that the flying <em>happened</em> or there would be no reason to call BS.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
Sereg,  the reason this keeps coming up is because if people don't accept something as evidence it means they don't consider it to be evidence in the first place. You're saying "There is evidence,  but you don't accept it" while everyone else is saying "but it's not evidence". Phrasing it that way is making it sound like you're saying "I'm right,  and everyone else just doesn't get it". </div>
<p></p>Er,  yes it is. Evidence can be misleading,  circumstantial,  inconclusive,  minor,  explained by completely different possibilities or even <em>planted to give the incorrect impression</em>. None of that stops it from being evidence.

<p></p>Okay,  let me rephrase it:  Saying that real world physics or physics in other fictional universes proves anything about Celestia is like saying that Abe Lincoln should be capable of flight because Superman is capable of flight.  He's not because the Lincoln universe and the Superman universe are <em>different</em>.
<p></p>As such,  my stance on Celestia is that any attempt at figuring out her power level (which doesn't really exist,  but I'll roll with it because this is entertaining) <em>must be based solely on what is portrayed in the show and nothing else</em>.  Real world physics has all of nothing to do with how strong she is because Equestria is not the real world and physics demonstrably do not work the same way.
<p></p>And now I will end the argument because it is time for lunch.

            Ace's description of different rulebooks is actually one of the best descriptions for why so many of us have issues with this I've yet seen.
<p></p>You're taking examples from comic books/shounen anime,  places where power levels and abilities are explicitly stated and often a focal point of the series,  and comparing it to western animation where <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> is the most powerful force in the verse and nobody can ever die regardless of what injuries they take.
<p></p>you simply can't use one to justify the other. By that logic,  Popeye is the most powerful character in the multiverse. He just needs spinach and he makes reality his bitch and insta wins any fight. You wanna try applying physics to that?
<p></p>No,  no you don't.

<p></p>Well,  that’s a completely different argument and one whose logic I can’t follow.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">As such,  my stance on Celestia is that any attempt at figuring out her power level (which doesn't really exist,  but I'll roll with it because this is entertaining) must be based solely on what is portrayed in the show and nothing else. Real world physics has all of nothing to do with how strong she is because Equestria is not the real world and physics demonstrably do not work the same way.</div>
<p></p>And by this argument,  we literally can’t have any idea about anything that is not explicitly shown or stated in the show. In fact,  we have zero evidence that say “cake” is the same as what we understand in the show. All we know is that it looks similar and is eaten. Naturally I disagree.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Popeye is the most powerful character in the multiverse. He just needs spinach and he makes reality his bitch and insta wins any fight. You wanna try applying physics to that?</div>
<p></p>No. He’s just more powerful than any character he’s fought before. And we have no evidence of them being particularly powerful.
<p></p>EDIT: <div class="quoteblock">@Blissey: It's also like comparing a pokemon with some overgrinded freak from Disgaea or with a cash-paying pimped-out A-Gear with e-40 hypergambled equips from Ace Online,  or with Kirito with his SAO old save bonus in ALO. </div>
<p></p>Still failing to see why this is  problem. Fully powered Arceus is multiversal anyway.
