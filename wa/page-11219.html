            @d Roy That person being your one shot at ultimate power and taking over an entire country is usually a good reason. Not to mention that she could mind control the one pony she knew of who would immediately know something was wrong. Twilight was the unknown factor that undid everything.

            Oh man,  that Vinyl plush.  I am so jelly of the amazing plushes this fandom produces.
<p></p>Its also possible Chrysalis only bothered keeping up the act in front of ponies she considered important,  ie Shining and the princesses.  And with Shining she could afford to slip a little,  thanks to the mind control.

            @Lurker - Why would that even be a one shot chance? It was not implied that she got her power from love of anyone other than Shining Armor. It wouldn't be as if it would be the only wedding. Now,  if she transformed into Shining Armor and was gaining power from Cadance,  it might make a bit more chance.

            @d Roy How often is there a royal wedding in the middle of Canterlot with Celestia in attendance and the groom being the one pony in charge of all of Canterlot's defenses? That sounds like a one time deal to me.

            @Lurker - If she was absorbing power from other guests in the wedding,  probably. Nothing of sort is implied. This also raises the question of the defense of Royal Guards being so utterly incompetent that anyone which such a half-baked preparation can utterly penetrate its core.

            @D Roy: We have no idea how good her prep was.  It was apparently good enough to fool <em>Celestia</em> so she must have done alright.  Again,  the <em>only</em> pony who saw through it was Twilight.  Just because she didn't anticipate Cadance giving SA a powerup doesn't mean she didn't prepare well.  That was literally the only thing that caught her offguard.

            @d Roy Ultimate power comes <em>after</em> you overthrow the kingdom from the inside with a sudden changeling blitz. As for the guards,  they weren't expecting the shield to go down. Why would they? As far as they knew,  <em>nothing</em> could breach Shining Armor's shield while he was maintaining it. Not to mention the sheer numbers of the Changeling army.  The plan was prepared extremely well,  IMO.  The only thing that was bungled was her handling of Twilight and her lack of knowledge of Cadance's abilities,  both of which were X Factors she couldn't have planned for.

            This will be the last post for today because I need to take care of something.
<p></p>JT - True,  but
<p></p>Chrysalis missed the fact that Cadance is a love goddess and acted completely different from the latter's character. I find it really annoying that how Cadance's drastic personality change escaped Shining Armor's notice. Yes,  he said that Cadance was under stress because of having to prepare the whole wedding. However,  as we see seconds after Chrysalis was defeated,  she looked pretty fine,  even the whole wedding preparation part did not change.
<p></p>There are so many pieces of screws missing in this finale's structure.

            Shining Armor was also pretty destracted by the impending threat,  so it isn't too big a stretch that he didn't pick up on Cadence acting strange.  They probably didn't see each other that much in the days leading up to the wedding.

            2 things:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Chrysalis missed the fact that Cadance is a love goddess and acted completely different from the latter's character.
</div>
"Being a love goddess" =/= "can give fiance an ubercharge".  Chrysalis knew Cadance was a love goddess,  she just didn't know that Cadance could do that.  Which isn't surprising given that Cadance isn't a fighter and has probably never used that power before anyway.  Also,  Chrysalis' personality was only truly different when she was around ponies she thought wouldn't notice the difference.  Whenever she's around Celestia or SA she's totally in character.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> I find it really annoying that how Cadance's drastic personality change escaped Shining Armor's notice.

<p></p><em>He was being brainwashed</em>.  Of course he didn't notice.  Also this <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">  And we have no idea when or how Chrysalis made the switch.  She could have easily done so before preparations began and then played up the "stress" element to explain her behavior.
