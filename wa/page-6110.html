            @stevebat: I think her <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerk Ass</a> episodes were easier to enjoy when they started her nicer ones to balance it out (eg. Over The Barrel and Hurricane Fluttershy,  which were somewhat later on). I think people may have been worried because she was getting one <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerk Ass</a> episode after the other for a while with few redeeming episodes.
<p></p>That's maybe why Applejack looks more limited,  only she is getting her nicer roles played more than her <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerk Ass</a> ones instead.
<p></p>Truth be told some may have considered Lesson Zero heavy flanderization if Twilight wasn't playing sane roles again afterwards. It's a matter of balance.

With her still harking to established characterization afterwards,  it's a fun establishing moment that shows her solo appeal as a flawed character.
<p></p>That's basically the problem with Flanderization,  the depictions may not be awful per se,  it's more they have become <em>the only thing</em> about the character.

            I still don't think Lesson Zero was <em>that</em> OOC for Twilight; it was a bit exaggerated,  but given how she freaked out over stuff involving Celestia in earlier episodes I don't think it was blown up beyond reasonable proportions.

One instance of not focusing on the entirety of a character's characterization does not constitute that.

<p></p>Compare it to Swarm of the Century. I just thought that it was weird that she'd have the most extreme breakdown of anypony when her previous one was relatively understated.

            @ lurker: But that's what I mean,  Twilight's insanity in that episode would have been considered heavy flanderization if she hadn't reverted bad to normal in some later episodes. Instead of her sane bouts it's flanderization,  alongside her sane bouts it just adds an extra facet to her character.
