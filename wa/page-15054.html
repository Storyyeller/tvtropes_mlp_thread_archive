            Hey all.  I see we're talking about movies.
<p></p>You know,  people always point out that there was enough room on that door for Jack and Rose,  but I've always thought that even if they could both balance on that without it tipping,  which could be difficult enough on its own,  their combined weight would push it down enough that they'd be partially in the freezing cold water and therefore die.

            Basically,  the ending of 2001 is simple. The protagonist goes through the gate which turns out to be a transdimensional hub for the various alien species deemed worthy of ascension by the creators of the Monolith.
<p></p>The creators were a sea-dwelling alien species that became self-aware. Eventually,  they spread out into space and found they were the only intelligent creatures in the universe. Also realizing that wouldn't be able to spread life while being mortal,  they somehow stored their memories and personalities into constructs of energy that became immortal.
Using their new supply of limitless life and energy as they can directly tap raw energy from the universe in their new bodies,  they build monoliths to find habitable planets and guide lifeforms with the potential  towards consciousness.
<p></p>He's taken into a hotel that's a representation of his lifespan where he's cycled through his memories until he's unwound to the moment at birth. The aliens judge that his decisions and the human race in general represented by him are worthy and he is made into a star-being like them.
<p></p>Then he's brought to Earth where he will guard the human race and guide it towards a better future.

<p></p>For me this is usually true,  but not always. I went to the theater to see <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Looper" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Looper">Looper</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lincoln" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lincoln">Lincoln</a> in the same day,  and I think the later was a far better movie.

And Kubrick did <em>such a great job</em> explaining this ending to his audience.
<p></p>I read the book of <em>2001</em> before I watched the movie. So I'm of the opinion that it's a great <em>experience</em>,  but kind of a bad <em>movie</em>. Because if your audience <em>has</em> to read the book in addition to watching the movie,  you've failed as a storyteller.

<p></p>My problem with the Titanic is that I could not give a crap about the romance. Movie about real life tragedies tend not to sit well with meâ€” with some exceptions.
<p></p>My childhood consisted of Disney,  a lot of the "classics",  and John Hughes movies. But my school system never had the stones to show anything interesting. Except for the one time in first grade they showed us <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSecretOfNimh" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSecretOfNimh">The Secret of NIMH</a>.

            I think that's kind of missing the point.  You aren't really supposed to fully understand what happened at the end of 2001.  You're supposed to leave the theater arguing with your friends about what just happened.
<p></p>Alternatively,  you're supposed to get baked out of your gourd and just trip the hell out.

            2001 is one of those movies that while I kinda want to watch it,  I already know how confusing it is without any outside reference.  While I <em>can</em> read the book beforehand so I know what's happening,  I'd really rather have the movie speak for itself,  and since it apparently does a poor job of doing that,  it's not terribly high on my to-do list.
<p></p>Hell,  the only real reason I want to watch it at all is so I can watch the scenes with HAL in it.  Forget the rest of the film,  I want to watch the homicidal computer.

            Which is why it's much more digestible as a book. The novel's only about 230 pages.
<p></p>Though I've heard the space travel section is worth watching for the really well done special effects and realism. Aparently,  it looks as good as Star Wars even even though it was made eleven years before.

<p></p>There was but it was almost all in spoilers. Apparently it's a decent movie but Brad and Sunset are not developed enough.

            For the most part I tend to take movies on individual merit,  as seen through the lens of my own preferences.  Most <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait">Oscar Bait</a> movies tend to fail on the second count.  I think the main issue is that I go to movies to be entertained rather than to examine any sort of philosophical or sociological point.    <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchindlersList" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchindlersList">Schindler's List</a> is a great movie,  to be sure,  but given the choice between watching it,  and watching say,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a>,  I'll go with the latter 95% of the time. Because Nazis are depressing.
<p></p>Basically it depends on how you go into it.  I tend to prioritize "entertaining" over "thought-provoking".  Although it's best to be <em>both</em>.
<p></p>And now I must sleep.

<p></p>From what I understand,  EQG is being pulled down as fast as it goes up. Someone apparently said the first 13 minutes were online somewhere,  but I don't know if that's still true; I haven't looked for it.
<p></p>Going back to what I said earlier,  it's a shame about Sunset and Flash. MLP has always had a bit of a problem in developing its supporting characters. Obviously,  the main characters are the priority and the shows' strongest point,  but it'd be nice to show off the supporting cast once in awhile. Particularly since they added two last season and possibly three more this one.
