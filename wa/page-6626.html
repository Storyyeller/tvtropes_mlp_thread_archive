<p></p>I think Luna just has to stick with her schedule.  She's back to controlling the moon,  so she is only active at night! Simple.   But I'm calling tons of fanworks dedicated to what Luna's been doing all that time!

            Luna wasn't around because she can't function during the daytime,  is my guess.  It was kind of rude of them not to host the wedding when she could attend,  but perhaps she didn't want to inconvenience everyone else.

            Ginger,  I <em>agreed</em> with you.
<p></p>I mean,  it's sort of hard to get a sense of scale with the Queen's power. She was able to imprison a lesser Alicorn on her own at least,  so she had to have <em>some</em> kind of power. But Celestia still took a nose dive pretty quick.
<p></p>Still,  SA can put a giant dome over an entire city,  and if the Queen was tapping him directly that's gotta be a <em>huge</em> boost.

            As I said,  maybe The Queen cast a spell on Luna that kept her asleep?
<p></p>Does that not have any merit?

She's the nocturnal one,  and she's been keeping watch 12/7 since the threat. She probably was sleeping like the dead.

            My take was that Celestia and the Queen would have been more or less even,  but the boost the Queen got from sapping SA gave her enough of an edge.  Keep in mind that <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a> is the strongest thing in Equestria,  and the queen is leeching it off of a guy who's one of the strongest unicorns in the country regardless.

            A minor thing I don't think anyone's mentioned,  I liked Celestia's face when she was stuck in that pod.
<p></p>Regarding Celestia's strength,  maybe most of her energy is tied up in the sun,  so she isn't just walking around with godlike power.
<p></p>I'm going to assume Cadence's power isn't forcing love on people love potion style,  but enhances feelings that are already there.  Otherwise it feels a bit weird.

            I can't properly articulate my feelings,  they are too vast and confusing. I did not expect this to be so good or so engaging or so emotionally wracking,  I was honestly expecting it to be slightly above average,  this finale had no business being as good as it was.
<p></p>This finale was simply incredible,  I cannot even begin to say how amazing it was,  and so densely packed too,  it feels like so much happened in so little time. This show needs to keep going on and going on strong and just... Wow. I mean what can I say besides I thought using the power of love was way way way at too cheesy and some of the songs had awkward lyrics,  but really,  that was just... Wow...
<p></p>Also,  how the bells did Cadence manage to turn Twilight's friends and family against her? You'd think they'd have more faith in her.
