            given that consulting is essentially getting paid to do nothing...
<p></p>joking aside,  I gather what she means is that she's not <em>actively</em> working on it. She gives pokes and prods,  creatively speaking - which is reasonable,  as 'adapted for TV by' is the toy/reboot/adaption version of 'created by',  so it is her,  as I'm given to understand at least - but she isn't really in charge anymore,  so she doesn't come in every day to make sure everything is on the right track.
<p></p>At least that's my take on it. Cartoons are not video games,  so producer could mean something completely different,  and I could be talking out of my arse.

            I honestly have no idea what this means for the show.
<p></p>But she says she's certain that it'll be just as entertaining. I'm betting even if it's something we don't like as much,  there's still going to be something to like about it,  and I really doubt it'll be anything awful. I've heard from I think some animator's account that seven of season two's episodes have already been finished,  and he had positive things to say about them.
<p></p>I'm just hoping this isn't a sign that we're going to get a bunch of executive meddling pushing the show away from what Faust gave it to make it great.

            The message of Suited for Success seems pretty universal in terms of producing art to the specifications of a client. It wouldn't be a huge surprise if at some point it became a reflection of what was involved behind the scenes of the show.

            The way he phrased it,  ("introduce new characters and bring back some old familiar ones"),  almost sounds like they want to start a new mane cast and only keep "the old ones" for cameos.

            Nah.
<p></p>Here's a post on the Allspark forums by a person who apparently works on the show:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
I've known about this for a while now,  was wondering when the news would finally break. Now before people go all gloom and doom,  I'd like to point out that she is still doing a lot of what she did in season 1. She's still heavily involved in the pre-production of season 2 (story and scripts),  she'll just be less involved in the post-production. This really won't have any impact on the production.
<p></p>To clarify what Kreoss was talking about in his blog,  no 7 episodes are not complete,  he's talking about watching animatics,  essentially storyboards with the recorded dialogue from the voice actors. Layout starts later this month,  and animation starts next month,  so it'll be a while yet before the season 2 episodes are ready. I've actually seen more of the animatics than he has at this point,  and season 2 is shaping up to be AMAZING. </div>
<p></p>See? That's not so bad.

            So she just won't be involved in things like animation? That's not such a big deal.

            Some other comments at Equestria Daily from a person who (allegedly) knows Lauren:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Basically from what Lauren told me,  the schedule was the biggest problem. We animators work under shorter and shorter schedules,  and the demands placed on us intensify with every new episode. Directors work 7 days a week sometimes,  under a lot of stress. And with budgets shrinking and writers changing their minds at the last minute it's amazing we can produce ANYTHING of quality.
<p></p>And yet,  we got season one of MLP :} Don't worry. Everything will be fine.</div>
<p></p>He went on to clarify his relationship with Lauren:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">No. I work on Family Guy. Lauren is an old friend from <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CalArts" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CalArts">Cal Arts</a>,  the animation school we both attended back in the mid-90's. She told me about her leaving the show many many months ago.
<p></p>And the last thing she wants is for ANY ponyfan to worry. She kept her departure a secret for months in order to keep you guys excited about the show. And it worked :} Up until tonight no one suspected a thing. So relax everypony.
<p></p>Me personally,  I can't wait to see what Lauren does next. This talented woman has made the rest of us Calartians proud. And who knows. Maybe her next project will be even BETTER than poni!
<p></p>Just keep an eye on her DA page y'all. I know she's cookin up something. </div>
<p></p>If that's true,  she hasn't actually been directly involved for a while.

            So,  I had a thought.
<p></p>Rarity was freaked about Spike seeing them get dressed,  and Applejack dismissed it by saying they don't normally wear clothes.
<p></p>That seems to imply there's some group... possibly a part of the high class Rarity was trying to emulate in that scene... that wears clothes almost always and hesitates to be seen without them. Otherwise,  I'm not sure that exchange would make much sense.

            Well news about Lauren wasn't good one,  but she wasn't fired because of some  stupid network move and she still have some involment in show so it's not that bad.
End that news from Kreoss make me more optimistic.
<p></p>Now I can't wait to learn who be now in charge of this show.
Some fans sugesting Rob Renzetti,  he can be good choice for that,  a liked or loved MLAATR.
<p></p>Edit:
After idea of Rob being in charge I whanted to see Pony Jenny. Hopefully I know somepony who like to draw and got inspired.
Here first try

            In all honesty,  I've been worried about Season 2 for awhile.  There are too many American cartoons that start out with a promising first season,  and then go to shit in the second—which is one reason I try not to get too involved with any of them—and all the speculation has me concerned that Season 2 is going to be a huge case of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">They Changed It, Now It Sucks</a>.
<p></p>However,  I'm just going to quietly and vehemently hope that Princess Celestia uses her magic powers and prevents the series from going down the shitter in season 2.  I'm also going to hope there gets to be a DVD release soon.  Please give us <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDs">DVDs</a>,  Hasbro!

            So...if Derpy ever gets some voice-acting,  what voice-actor would be more suitable for her? This fandom has so many interpretations about her personality that I find it hard to imagine her speaking.

            I'm honestly not worried. Some of the people who are thinking the series will now shit the bed in Season 2 are forgetting that Lauren stepped down herself. Lauren leaving is not <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>,  perhaps she wanted to focus more on her Galaxy Girls project she has everywhere on her dA
<p></p>As long as the same team we had in Season 1 is intact,  and the writing,  characterization,  and more is generally the same: I don't think it's time to worry just yet.

            Well,  that was distressing - one of the other people working on the show said that it wouldn't have that much of an impact,  though - she's still working on it,  just more pre-production than post-production.
<p></p>Also,  Derpy becoming an official character - that's gotta be good.

            I'm worried that Derpy becoming a character might be a bad idea.
<p></p>Mainly because one good part of Derpy is that she can be really whatever we want her to be,  and attaching a canon personality to that could be...problematic.
<p></p>...Of course,  there's always the chance that she manages to be just as endearing as the mane cast. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

            I'm  worried to. I prefer Derpy as normal/little odd  pony than  ditz/full retard.
Horever Lauren and others from show crew gain so much trust and respect for me that I can accept any thing what they do with Derpy.

            As soon as I read about Faust leaving I immediatly had flashbacks to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gargoyles" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a> season 3. Some reasearch shows that the showrunner Greg Weisman was not the only person to leave at that time. Apparently the entire production staff was replaced and outsourced to someplace else. As long as we're keeping everyone else I think we'll be okay without Faust.
<p></p>So,  what's our favorite bubble-head blonde going to be called? Is her name going to be Derpy or Ditzy Doo?
