<p></p>That's bollicks...not bollicks as in 'I don't believe you'...bollicks as in 'that fucking sucks and it is an injustice'.  What was the place?  Fast food places do treat the staff pretty bad.

            It was a sort of Manitoba-only chain called... Chicken chef,  or Chicken delight or something. It was a crappy place to work. The boss was a raving(Literally) asshole,  and he was sort of famous for going through employees really quickly - except for the hot girls,  of course. I only worked there for three weeks(didn't even finish the probationary period,  which I'm not sure is even allowed) before being fired. Not that I minded too much.

            So... how about ponies? I mean,  job talk is nice and all,  but I'm sure there's a thread for it elsewhere...
<p></p>Apparently Unicon imploded on itself yesterday after gross mismanagement of funds. They weren't able to come up with the money to pay the hotel,  so everyone got kicked out early,  and the rooms for the guests of honor that had been comped by the hotel then became full-rate rooms,  which a lot of the guests couldn't afford. Luckily,  a bunch of other people chipped in to salvage as much of the mess as they could. Seems like a pretty good sign that way too many people have been starting conventions lately without having a shed of a clue of what they were doing. The fandom needs to cut back a bit.

            I heard about that. Sounds like a royal mess. If you're gonna do it in Vegas,  you better have the money.
<p></p>It's great that a bunch of third parties did their best to make sure everything worked out,  but still.

            Right,  yes... pones.
<p></p>I'd always kind of considered the conventions for this a bit odd anyways. I mean,  generally you only see fandom-specific conventions when the show in question is HUGE,  don't you? I know we're big,  but I didn't think we were like,  star-trek-a-palooza big.
<p></p>That and any time I've been to a meeting or group based around a single thing I've always felt vaguely like Asimov at Mensa(who allegedly sat in silence for half of one of their meetings before suddenly shouting,  "Don;t you people ever talk about <em>girls</em>!?")

            @Lopiny Actually,  that is literally about the worst possible thing that could happen at a con aside from serious crimes. The hotel started coming after the vendors for money the convention owed it,  and less wealthy guests were getting thrown out of their rooms. Hotels in Vegas take money very seriously.

            Advice for anyone wanting a room down here. Get as far away from the Strip as possible,  those vampires will suck you dry of everything. And if you want freebies or player points to lighten the price,  go to as many machines under a dollar as you can so you don't lose much and can still rack up enough points to get a few free meals out of it. Poor tourists,  they have no idea what they're doing.

We just developed faster because Internet.  But yeah,  doing a con without the cash on hand is...kinda stupid.  I'd never even attempt to start <em>anything</em> like that unless I had a fairly large buffer budget in place.

            Yeah,  I live in Vegas. You'd be surprised how many newbie tourists who never thought it through losing everything and getting a cheap job at the very casino they lost their savings at just to get a ticket back home. The glamor  wears off quick. Only the rich or the really stupid can afford the Strip,  the rest of us have cheap casinos far from the limos and business suits where the mayor doesn't bother to give us any money. The school district is so bad we're the very bottom standard funding in the country,  the architecture's falling apart,  the million and a half people living here get ignored because the rest of the world thinks we're all rich gamblers,  the summers can get up to 120 degrees for weeks on end,  and in general it's a damn depressing place to live.

She's actually <em>started a petition</em> to try and get him kicked off,  not to mention she's labeling everyone that turns up at her blog to defend Jitters as cloppers and has had enough showing up on her blog that she's actually turned off asks. Jitters is actually being quite reasonable about it,  he's just simply asking her for reasons as to <em>why</em> she thinks the blog is like that,  and asking for evidence.

<p></p>And I can imagine Vegas has that sort of problem. When you actually have to live there,  you see everything,  not just what looks good to tourists.

            That sounds... really remarkably shitty,  Dark. I guess that's what happens when one single portion of the city gets all the attention. The rest sort of gets left behind...
<p></p>Any prospects for getting out? I doesn't exactly sound like the place to stay,  all things considered.
