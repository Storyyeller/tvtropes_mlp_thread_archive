            Criticized? The only high-class pony that's been called out on bad behavior was Blue <span class="strike">Balls</span>Blood,  and that's only because he was an asshead by anyone's standards.
<p></p>What is boils down to is a huge difference in culture between the kind of ponies that usually wind up at the gala,  and those of our favorite ponies from Ponyville. So they don't "PAR-TAY!",  and probably aren't all too fond of apple fritters. Does that make them bad people? I think not.

Right,  I couldn't exactly take either side.  Most of the main characters were at fault for not staying cool and enjoying the gala for what it was,  but the Gala's planners may have also been at fault for not providing enough chances for new guests to loosen up.  I think the conflict is personified in Rarity and Prince Blueblood,  each expecting the other to be more gallant.

            I agree with Kyle too. My point is that,  the snobbish   behavior itself was portrayed a bit negatively. They weren't shown as evil nor jerks to the level of blur blood however.
<p></p>It was a critique oriented more towards the bahavior than the ponies on it.

            Don't want to bore you,  but snobbishness as defined by the dictionary is  "Having the property of being a snob,  arrogant and pretentious,  smugly superior or dismissive as inferior."
<p></p>Rarity was not like that on that episode.I think that part of the  point of Rarity is to show that you can be a lady without being a snob/jerk.

            how did she make that cake anyway? where did she cook it? what did she use as ingredients? (the only things she had with her were the fritters pies and whatnot,  did she throw them in a big bowl?)

            I think we're taking the whole Gala thing too seriously.  Celestia probably just underestimated how much damage everyone would cause.  She may be good at predicting stuff,  but she obviously doesn't get everything right all the time.
<p></p>My guess about why the gala is how it is is that it's simply been done that way for so long that it's considered an Equestrian tradition that nopony wants to risk changing.  Celestia included.  She technically has the authority,  but if she pulled rank and reformatted everything she'd probably get complaints.

            Is it bad when the background music for a kids show about ponies goes incredibly well with a psychotic breakdown scene from a horror movie? Well,  that's what this is. It's the BGM from Pinkie's breakdown in Party of One set to the "Laughing Room" scene from Evil Dead 2. I made it,  but I got the idea from an Fi M thread

            My theory is that the Apple family has limited transmuation powers relating to apples and baked goods.
That would also explain where they get all the flour and other stuff that goes into the pastries. Seriously,  if you look at episode 21 you get the impression that they're fabricating pies entirely out of apples.
