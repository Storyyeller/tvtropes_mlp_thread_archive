            Late to the comments,  but I liked this episode as a nice (relatively) "normal" show after the mood swings of the first three.  Pinkie Pie freaking out was starting to get annoying,  but turned into <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> after her "being scared is fun" explanation.
<p></p>Fluttershy hiding in her house all night was <em>absolutely</em> perfect,  and apparently she wasn't alone — check out the animal noises when Twilight goes to drag her out.
<p></p>Not sure how I feel about Pipsqueak right now.  He was okay in this episode,  but some folks are already calling him <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a>,  and it's too early to tell if he'll fall into that or not.

            My best guess about the issues people have with Pipsqueak is that he's unnecessary; you could have removed him from the episode and replaced him with any of the other fillies or colts and it wouldn't really have changed anything.  He hasn't done anything to earn the ire of the bronies,  but he hasn't done a whole lot to endear himself either.  Yes,  he's adorable,  but so is pretty much every other pony outside of Snips and Snails.
<p></p>Personally,  I'm sort of ambivalent.  I don't dislike him,  and I think he's cute,  but at the same time I have to wonder why they introduced him if he isn't going to play any role in the plot.

            Who says he isn't?  Apple Bloom was introduced with little fanfare or development until Bridle Gossip. Maybe Pipsqueak will be a recurring character as a foil to the CMC.

            I think Pip did have an important role in the plot, 
<p></p>he shows just how fun 'Nightmare Night' can be for a little kid.  Yes,  the other kids could have done it,  but the fact that it was his first makes it more significant.
<p></p>Oh,  and although I don't approve of yappy fans complaining that Luna isn't what she's supposed to be,  there's no need to <em>totally</em> kick all those fics down.  They were just going with what little infomation they had. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">

            You know small part of not target audience hate one character and you whant call him Scrappy?  What about kids in target audiece.
<p></p>From what I was everything on this site about this show is writen from Brony perpective,  especialy YMMV stuff.  Older cartoons on this wiki have point off view of kids who watched them (because they are tropers now).  There is anything on TV Tropes what say how  little girls for who this show is aimed react about anything from MLPFIM ?  Anythig what they like or dislike was included?

            I don't think that Apple Bloom is a comparable case; she had all of one line and was basically a background pony until Bridle Gossip came around,  and in that episode she played a pretty big role.
<p></p>I'd love to see Pipsqueak actually end up doing something in later episodes,  but in this episode he just didn't do much.

<p></p>I agree about that,  in the past weeks,  the fandom really went too far with the "Stupid luna fandumb will surely rage about canon luna,  and it will be hilarious" meme. I didn't actually see <em>any</em> brony claiming that fanfic-luna should be left untouched,  but I saw so many  comments in the opposite direction,  that it feels like the fandom just created a phantom-enemy,  and everyone is raging on the same side against it.

Given that the fandom is internet based and has probably seen their fair share of flame wars,  it wasn't that big of a jump to conclusions to think that people would rage over Luna,  especially as she was one of the most popular characters.  It probably did go a bit overboard,  but building up the conflict only to have it not happen is <em>way</em> preferable to people actually raging about it.  I think we can just have a laugh at how everything turned out and move on.

            So it's been almost eight hours since the episode aired,  and there is still no controversy about Luna. I guess my worries were unfounded.
<p></p>I liked her <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness">Sesquipedalian Loquaciousness</a> and lack of contractions,  that was a nice touch. I <em>did</em> want to smack Pinkie for most of the episode,  and it seems Twilight has been hit a bit more with the self-aware humor stick.
<p></p>And Zecora came back,  that was long overdue. (And I notice that Rarity was absent,  or at least didn't speak if she did appear)
