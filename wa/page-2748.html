            Ginger,  now you're just stretching to justify your Pinkie hate.  The episode says RD did it,  and there is nothing there to suggest she's lying.  If she was covering for Pinkie there would have been some indication.  Besides which,  why would she need to cover for Pinkie?  She could have just called Gilda out for being unable to take what she can dish out.

<p></p>I really don't think there is ANY evidence of that.  But since it's been like a month since I watched the episode and I only watched it once,  I'm not gonna argue any further.  You guys would likely know better than I.

            My only issue with "Look Before You Sleep" is that Twilight apparently lost about 30 IQ points.  I mean,  even if you've never had a slumber party before,  you should know that a tree busting in the window isn't supposed to happen.
<p></p>As far as focus episodes go,  I don't think it's necessary for a character to be the focus in order to be likeable,  but the more screentime they get,  the the more well rounded the character becomes.  They can be entertaining as secondary characters,  but they probably won't get a lot of characterization unless they have a fair amount of focus in the episode.  A single episode won't make or break a character entirely,  but it'll certainly influence the audience's perception of them a lot more than a non-focus episode would.

            I don't think there's much evidence that it was Pinkie's fault in comparison to Rainbow but the fact that every prank we saw was specifically tailored to cause Gilda to set it off deserves some recognition.

            @Crow I don't think RD was covering for Pinkie. (at least not consciously) I think she was manipulated into setting up pranks around the party by Pinkie. Since it was Pinkie who was throwing the party,  who else would Gilda suspect once things started getting weird? That would eventually cause her to snap at Pinkie,  triggering the bombshell from RD that it was all set up by her. Making Gilda look bad.

<p></p>Yeah,  I don't... I don't think Pinkie is smart enough,  or has enough foresight,  OR has enough understanding of others (she thinks totally different from other people,  meaning she would have serious trouble predicting their actions) to pull that off.

            ...Except that most of the jokes hey put <em>before</em> are RD's ideas. It makes much more chance to me that Pinkie was optimistic enough to think a party might make Gilda more friendly.
<p></p>Plus,  even if it was a revenge,  <em>she made Fluttershy cry.</em> If I was there I would be able to tell you how roasted griffins taste like. NOPONY MAKES MAH FLUTTERSHY CRY.
<p></p>And It's also quite obvious tht we are all intented to think <em>at first</em> that Pinkie set a trap for Gilda. It's just slapstick power that Monkey'd her butt.

<p></p>re: Pinkie VS Gilda
<p></p>Honetly I took the episode as PP throwing a party with the hopes of making Gilda a better person and getting caught by all of <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RDs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RDs">R Ds</a> pranks as coinsdence. I don't think there is any evidence that RD was manipulated by Pinkie.

            @ Dhana: Making Fluttershy cry was not the worst thing she did that episode. I'd think that stealing would be worse than yelling at somebody who walked into you.

The thing that bothers me about this is that it seems most people are mad about it <em>mostly</em> because it's Fluttershy who she got mad at. I wonder if the reaction would have been the same had it been Daisy or something.

            Hmm ? Oh,  sorry. I've a little tendency to overreact when someone MAKES MAH FLUTTERSHY CRY. See ?
<p></p>You can say what you want,  but Gilda stealing an apple wasn't <em>that</em> bad and her joke on Granny was kinda fun,  if cruel. It's really her first act of gratuitous jerkassness (even sending Pinkie fly away can be put on Pinkie being Pinkie)
