            @Purple and that's why I'm worried about PH. Watcher basically just told blackjack that she has absolutely no chance of EVER redeeming herself in chapter 3!!

            There's plenty of levity.  Blackjack can be hilarious at times.  Its dark humor,  but still.  Like I said,  I do find the grimdark aspect unpleasant at times,  but I still enjoy the story as a whole.

            What I mean by Levity is the characters being NICE to each other. Is there any of THAT?

            There are some glimmers of hope in the despair. Everything Blackjack has done has had positive consequences as well,  like improving certain places,  making opportunity for other places to recover from the terrible things that have happened,  and some of the villains get their comeuppance.
