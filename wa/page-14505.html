            Huh.  From what we'd previously heard,  I'd assumed all six of them were going to earth,  but I guess its just Twilight,  and the rest are all just human doppelgangers?  I wonder why there isn't a Twi double.  I also wonder why she'd bother going to high school when she presumably has more pressing concerns.  That feels like an unnecessary concession for the marketing folks or whoever.  I also also wonder why the designs we saw had cutie marks on their faces and were colorful if they're presumably just regular humans.  Unless those designs are outdated and I didn't hear about it.

            So exactly what we expected has been confirmed(now with 80% more AU characters).

            This thing sounds SO terrible that I absolutely,  positively hate it already. I hate it <em>so</em> much that the show is pretty much ruined by proxy. In fact,  I hate it so much that I'm going to go see it a dozen times so that I can capture every detail perfectly in my memory,  and write a one hundred thousand word blog post dedicated to how <em>terrible</em> it is,  and then dedicate my time to <em>curating</em> that blog,  as well as for establishing a forum to talk about how terrible it is.
<p></p>But no,  seriously... I believe in M.A. Larson.jpg. I'll watch it,  just to see if it could be good.

<p></p>I went to public school and I never encountered that stuff. Well possibly cliques,  but I generlaly didn't pay attention to social stuff.
<p></p>Also,  did they actually release new art? The blog post image looks more like fanart to me.

            Why would Magic Kidnergarten not exist? Surely,  if it didn't Twilight would have been imagining some <em>other</em> prior embarassing level of school to be busted back to,  right?

            @storyyeller - There is probably a fine line between it. Maybe. Maybe not.
<p></p>As for magic kindergarten,  unless we see it again any future episode,  I am going to write it up as something Twilight made up in her nervous panic suffering mind.
