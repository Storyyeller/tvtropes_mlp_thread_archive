            The Puzzle and the Ring were always pretty vague to me. I still don't know EXACTLY what the Puzzle does (I know it lets you change fate but what the hell does that mean? It lets you cheat at cards?)
<p></p>and the ring seemed to do whatever the hell the show runners wanted it to do

            I thought the ring just hunted down other items? Or perhaps more generally,  it finds what you want?
<p></p>But the Puzzle always seemed like a cheap item to me,  simply because it didn't do anything solid. As far as I knew,  it simply summoned the ghost of some dude to posses you and make you grow a few inches.
<p></p>But yeah,  Pegasus was totally awesome. Don't know how a guy managed to be threatening by playing cards,  and remaining generally amicable at that,  but dude pulled it off.

            I remember the ring also turned Yugi's friends into playing cards and made the cards work in the real world. Like he used it to bind a couple of guards.
<p></p>Although,  I think all the items could do that,  they was a whole host of secondary powers that the items had which were poorly established.
<p></p>I think Pegasus was the only Yu Gi Oh villain that I liked... oh wait,  I thought Dartz was pretty cool too

<p></p>I always loved Pegasus and his Toon deck. Or Dartz and his broken Orichalchos deck.
<p></p>Who was the guy who had a valkyrie and rose themed deck?

            Wasn't Kaiba's deck pretty much <em>built</em> around the Blue Eyes White Dragon?
<p></p>I'm with Ginger,  I always liked the toon deck as a kid. Plus I just love Pegasus's image of 'does not give a fuck'. He just buggers around with his opponents,  and <em>always</em> felt like he was in control. He's a damn good villain.
<p></p>Kaiba spent to much time switching back and forth between ally and bad guy. Never knew whether or not to root for him,  so after a while I just got pissed off. Plus he didn't have 'the hair'. My dad always used to say watching an anime,  "You know who's gonna win? The guy wit the hair. Root for the guy with the hair."
