            So,  what was everybody's favourite part of the episode?
<p></p>I think mine might have been when Rarity came back to Twilight's party with a Croquet Mallet.

            How many people actually go into the grand hall on a regular basis? And how true to life were the depictions.
<p></p>Someone who spends a lot of time in Canterlot palace would recognize them,  but probably not a fluffed-up aristocrat. Ironically,  it seems like a servant would be the first one to recognize the heroes.

Rarity getting a hat as big as herself out of fucknowhere and then giggling like a madpony.

            I think my favorite part might have been the Sudden Twilight. I didn't see that coming at <em>all</em>,  to be honest. I had to pause the video to laugh. Was a bit weirded out when the seemingly inevitable "busted" scene didn't materialize.
<p></p>Fluttershy using her hair as a bird-nest was also funny.

            I'm glad that the animators are keeping "Canterlot background ponies" and "Ponyville background ponies" from getting mixed in together. Watching the crowd scenes I didn't see anyone from ponyville,  but I did recognize a few ponies from the Gala,  including <a class="urllink" href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/139/589/looks%20like%20doctor%20whoovez.jpg?1308890186">the 5th incarnation of Dr. Whooves.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

            agreed the entire Twilight Birthday party.
<p></p>Though the single funniest gag for me was when they pony conga'd off screen,  then when they cam back rarity was still in perfect conga line formation,  but on the other side of the window.
<p></p>Derpy was one of the ponies in the gaint wall of ponies during the song,  at eh "talk of all of Cantorlot" line.

            My favorite bit was probably Twilight appearing out of nowhere.  It caught me off guard just as much as it did Rarity.  Twilight's awkward dancing is a close second.

<p></p>BTW,  Rarity's voice actress has an awesome singing voice,  assuming she's one of the ones who's actress also does the singing.

            Looks like it's sometime close to the Grand Galloping Gala. Impossible to tell exactly when,  of course. I'd say at least a month beforehand,  due to the socialites still having time to order dresses from Rarity,  but we all know how fast she can make dresses.

            Took me way longer than I would have liked to see this episode,  since there seemed to be a hiccup in getting an HQ version up this morning,  and I was busy for the rest of the day. Some impressions:
<p></p><ul><li> This was actually one of my favorite episodes in a while. Which is odd because my opinion was a little lukewarm as I watched it,  but it was the first one since Lesson Zero that I wanted to rewatch immediately upon finishing.
</li><li> I'm glad I didn't watch it this morning when my roommate was around. I was thinking of coming out of the brony closet,  but as I was watching,  I kept thinking that this certainly wasn't the episode to do it with.
</li><li> Meghan <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McCarthy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McCarthy">Mc Carthy</a> has finally surpassed M.A. Larson as my favorite writer. They've always been neck-and-neck,  but while I love M.A. Larson's adventures,  he seems to occasionally sacrifice characterization for the story. Meghan,  meanwhile,  draws upon it to make the episode better.
</li><li> Woo! The Gala ponies are back!
</li><li> Woah,  Luna's body type on a regular unicorn?
</li><li> Octavia,  Bruce Mane and Blueblood? Me gusta.
<ul><li> I was more excited by Blueblood's reappearance than I thought I would be. From a Doylist perspective,  they were obviously just re-using assets to fill the song,  but I'd love to hear the story behind his and Rarity's apparently cordial relations. I'm sure a fanfic will show up one of these days.
</li></ul></li><li> DAT MUSIC. Both the song and the score were particularly on-point today. For some reason,  I heard a bit of Return of Harmony's leitmotif when Twilight explained she moved her party. I guess they could have reused the music like they sometimes do,  but it seemed like a new composition to me.
</li><li> Yay <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNods" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNods">Continuity Nods</a>!
</li><li> Oh hey,  the Fifth Doctor is back! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin">
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanBoy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanBoy">ELEVENTH DOCTOR PONY WAEDBGTAKEBASTDSADG</a>
</li><li> I actually sympathized with Rarity for pretty much all of the episode,  even when she's lying and especially the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoTimerDate" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoTimerDate">Two Timer Date</a>. Twilight's dancing was adorkable,  but it made me really embarrassed for Rarity. I'm not sure I like what all that says about me. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<ul><li> Even so,  why doesn't Rarity just tell the truth about her friends early on? I mean,  even ignoring the saving-the-world-twice thing,  Twilight is Celestia's prized pupil,  Fluttershy was one of Photo Finish's top models who one day just vanished out of the limelight with no explanation,  Dash is the Best Young Flier,  Applejack runs a fairly prominent apple-supply company,  and Pinkie <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OkayIGuessICanUnderstandHerHesitation" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OkayIGuessICanUnderstandHerHesitation">is probably infamous for jumping onstage at last year's Grand Galloping Gala right before all hell broke loose</a>.

            My sister saw the episode. She was actually siding with Rarity the entire time,  and actually thought that choosing the Garden party was smarter than going back for Twilight's birthday. (though she did say that she should've told them the truth about it in her letter)
<p></p>She groaned at the party cannon too. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii"> It's the little things in life
