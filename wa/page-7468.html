<p></p>Speaking of bird feeders,  I think Humminbird Feeders should be renamed to bird feeders. Every time we've put one up,  a group of bees eventually teamed up and drove the humming birds off. The humingbirds fight each other while the bees gang up.

            Because most of the time when people say Apple,  they're talking to Applelight,  so I tend to accidently ignore it if someone is actually talking to me. Is it really that hard to say Story instead?

            @ Apple: Apparently they're sent over here as a sort of learning experience on how to beg,  and they have to bring in a certain amount every day or else they're beaten and they have to sleep in bad conditions. I have a solution for not having to do that: Don't go! Screw what your parents say,  actually <em>do</em> something with your life!
