<p></p>If there's one thing I know how to do,  its how to avoid making an OC a Mary Sue.
<p></p>A self insert isn't bad,  it just has a bad reputation.  Generally,  I see it like this:
<p></p>If you're going to make yourself a character in a story,  make sure you add your strengths AND weaknesses. No one is omnipotent,  and we all have our skeletons in the closets.  Conflict drives plot.  Even though you might not be as 'awesome' as you want,  but you can write a better story.
<p></p>Not only that,  you can make inherently 'dull' characteristics cool if you know how to write them.  There's a reason why there's a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">Badass Bookworm</a> trope.
<p></p>Anyway,  I hope to get it on Equestria Daily.

            The majority of people read a story for the characters more so than for the setting.  If you make a story sound like it's all about an original character,  you've disinterested a large segment of your potential audience right off the bat.  On the other hand,  if you just want to slip them in as minor characters here and there,  you should consider leaving them out of synopses and the like; chances are that by the time people are in the middle of the story itself,  they won't care if a new character pops in for a scene or two.

            <div class="quoteblock"> I think some people have already pointed out how Rainbow Dash is almost a carbon copy of Butercup from The Powerpuff Girls. Their voices are nearly identical,  they have the same personality,  etc. </div>
Oh,  so there's what I was thinking.  I couldn't remember who voiced Buttercup,  I just remembered it was that sort of hoarse woman's voice they like to use for tomboys,  and then Tara Strong's name got mixed up in my head.  Well,  I don't see Buttercup and Rainbow Dash as being all <em>that</em> similar,  anyway.  Buttercup was more about getting tough,  while Rainbow Dash was more about showing off,  I think.  Applejack might be a better match for Buttercup,  but then again it's been so long since I've seen The Powerpuff Girls that maybe I need to go back and watch more episodes to be sure.  Or maybe it works better if you imagine that one PPG inspires two <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MLPs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MLPs">ML Ps</a>.
<p></p>I actually like the comparisons between Rainbow Dash and Sonic the Hedgehog—except that Rainbow Dash is also like one of Sonic's many friends who can fly under their own power while he can't.  You know how Pinkie Pie lost her hair curls and turned a darker shade of pink when she lost her marbles?  Well,  I think it would be hilarious if whenever Rainbow Dash goes bad,  she turns dark blue and starts talking out the side of her mouth.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">  (Though one of the things I found scary about <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1hETuP33r8">this video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is how easily Rainbow Dash can be interpreted as a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">lighter,  fluffier</a> Comedian.)
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Well,  there's also a carbon copy of Fluttershy out there. Any Gundam SEED fans know that Lacus Clyne is a sweet,  overly polite character. As to her love of animals,  well,  take a look at this video at about three minutes in. (Youtube has literally nothing but music videos on the subject.) Granted Lacus isn't quite as shy but she sounds nearly the same and both characters actually burst into song several times. Heck,  they even have the same hair. </div>
Ah,  that's interesting.  I never watched Gundam Seed,  so until now my best reference for Fluttershy has been Disney's Snow White.  (This is also one reason why,  despite not being much of a shipper,  I keep wondering if Prince Blueblood would have gotten along much better with Fluttershy at the Gala.)  But... Dear lord,  what are those things bouncing around them?!  Cybernetic Parasprites!?

<p></p>Well here's the thing.  The whole purpose of the 'human in equestria' story is just that:  having a human OC at the center of the story which tells his adventures in a land of ponies.  I think the problem most people have with self insert OC's is that they make the story EXCLUSIVELY about them,  and turn everyone else into strictly supporting characters.  Like I said,  I've had some experience making this not happen with my stories.  It's the same problem with crossovers:  too much of one continuity,  not enough of the other.
<p></p>It's all about balance.

            If you were to ever see my old work,  then read my new work,  the difference is black and white.  I learned from my mistakes and now I know how to write it.
<p></p>And dude,  I'd LOVE to see someone do a real "Megan with new ponies" story or comic.
<p></p>Though I'm not sure how to handle that fact in my fic.  Humans play an... interesting role in Equestria.

            Well,  I need to write the first chapter to begin with,  but I think I can spare you all a taste.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Rays of the noon sun cast long shadows against the bedroom wall as dust motes danced in the beams.  Tucked up against the bay window lay a wood-carved bed with deep purple covers pulled up to the headboard.  A lumpy mass moved underneath the sheets as a sleepy mumble emanated from the white down pillow now jutting from the mass of purple.
<p></p>Once the movement ceased,  the head of the bed’s occupant,  Twilight Sparkle,  was now visible.  Her normally placid mane was a frizzy mess; the infamous bed-mane having claimed another victim.  She sighed deeply to herself,  still asleep and blissfully unaware of the world around her.
<p></p>“PONY PILE!”
<p></p>(Fwoom)
<p></p>The purple unicorn was immediately ejected from her cocoon of covers and tossed into the air.  Her eyes snapped open as she plummeted face-first back onto the spring-filled mattress.  With a garbled yell,  her head was buried in a cloud of floating feathers as her pillow exploded.
<p></p>“It’s about time you woke up you sleepy head.”  Twilight groaned as  she pulled her face from the impact site.
<p></p>“Pinkie Pie, ” she groaned.  “Why?”
<p></p>“Why, ” the cotton-candy pink pony asked.  “Well,  you’ve been asleep all day and I was afraid something happened and then Spike told me you were up all night and I was like ‘HUUHHH’ and then I waited and waited and – ”  Twilight put her hoof to Pinkie’s mouth,  silencing the hyperactive pony.
<p></p>“What do you mean ‘all day’?”  Twilight asked,  looking over at her alarm clock on her nightstand.
<p></p>“I mean that it’s already lunch time silly filly.”  Twilight wanted to rebuke her friend,  but the clock’s hand’s did not lie.  It was already a quarter past noon.
<p></p>“Wait,  how did I sleep in?  I set the alarm for eight this morning.”
<p></p>“That one was me Twi’, ”  The purple dragonling nudged the bedroom door open with the corner of a breakfast tray he was balancing on the top of his head.  “Owlowiscious told me you pulled another all nighter,  so I got up extra early and turned off your alarm clock.”
<p></p>“Spike, ” Twilight moaned.  “Wait,  since when did you and Owlowiscious talk?”
<p></p>Spike grinned as he placed the tray on Twilight’s desk,  nudging aside several books in the process.  “Well,  we came to a gentleman’s agreement.  He’s really quite talkative once you get to know him.”
<p></p>“But isn’t his entire vocabulary one word?”  Spike shrugged as he brought Twilight over a plate.
<p></p>“There you go,  one peanut butter and apple sandwich.”
<p></p>“Spike,  you know I hate peanut butter.”
<p></p>“OH, ” Spike hastily withdrew his fingers as Pinkie Pie bit the sandwich out of his hands.  “Datch one’s mime.”  She announced,  trying to speak through the copious amount of sticky residue in her mouth.
<p></p>“Ok, ” he sighed,  reaching for another plate on the tray.  “Here,  some celery and carrots,  along with a freshly toasted corn muffin.  Oh,  and Granny Smith sent over some more of that apple and cinnamon tea you like.”
<p></p>Twilight sighed to herself as she floated the china teacup to her lips.  “Mmmm,  that’s wonderful.”
<p></p>Pinkie Pie,  however,  interrupted the unicorn’s moment of bliss.  Almost immediately,  the curly-maned pony began making frantic motions with her legs; her hooves flailing about in wide patterns.
<p></p>“Um,  Pinkie Pie,  what’s wrong?” Twilight asked,  setting the teacup down on her nightstand. Pinkie continued to wave her arms around while making spitting noises with her tongue.
<p></p>“Umm,  you wanna start a cart-wash for Sugarcube Corner?”  Spike suggested.  Pinkie shook her head before putting a hoof to her lips and opening her mouth.
<p></p>“You need a bullhorn?”  Twilight asked.  Pinkie shook her head again.  This time,  she made grabbing and pulling motions with her hooves,  all while grunting and groaning.
<p></p>“Umm,  I’m not sure I wanna know what that is supposed to be.”  Spike announced.
<p></p>Pinkie slapped a hoof to her face and sighed.  Twilight cringed as the pink party pony opened her mouth,  revealing a mass of gooey peanut butter clinging to the insides of her cheeks.
<p></p>“I meedpth milmk.”  She shouted; her words muffled by the sticky obstruction.
<p></p>“Well why didn’t you just say so in the first place?”  Twilight asked.  Pinkie’s mouth snapped shut as she leveled a flat stare at her unicorn friend.
<p></p>“Downstairs,  in the fridge,  behind the turnips, ”  Spike told her.  Pinkie saluted with her hoof before galloping out of the room.  “And don’t touch the sapphires in there.  They’re my dessert for tomorrow!”
