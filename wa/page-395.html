            ^She does look rather gangly,  but that's where I'd put her,  yes.
<p></p>@Gingerninja: We've never seen an alicorn who wasn't either Celestia or Luna,  so it seems pretty likely that it's a mark of divinity - kind of in the same way a lot of mythologies have gods that incorporate both male and female,  Equestria's goddesses incorporate elements from all three pony breeds.  Of course,  the alternative is that there's nothing <em>inherently</em> divine about alicorns,  and that they're just rare and insanely powerful mortals who have become the royal family over thousands of years by virtue of being able to raise and lower the heavenly bodies.

That will be tough to answer,  unless more appear,  or for any other reason the issue becomes relevant to the story.  They could just be from a family of rare mutants,  or maybe there's an "ascension" process where regular ponies become super alicorns.

<p></p>Why does everyone assume that not seeing dragon assistants everywhere implies that it is a very rare event?
<p></p>We haven't actually seen many unicorns from Canterlot. And the ones at the gala can easily be explained by a combination of low magical ability/ think it's beneath them/ don't bring their assistants to a fancy gala.

            Also,  how powerful do you think Celestia and Luna are? as in can they do magic on Twilight's level or above? (Could they pull off mass telekinesis like in Boast Busters for instance) Is their ability to move the heavenly bodies a form of said telekinesis,  or is it a seperate spell? So many questions. I know they can't be canonically answered,  but I want to hear your thoughts.

            I think it's safe to say that Celestia is much more powerful than Twilight. Even ignoring the fact that she's god,  she's also the one who taught Twilight advanced magic in the first place.

            @Death Cloud:That's the thing.  She's a lot smaller than Celestia,  so she must still have some growing to do,  but I imagine baby alicorns look about the same as baby ponies.  She's probably older,  relatively speaking,  than filly Fluttershy,  but younger than the mane cast,  since they seem to be physically mature.
<p></p>^Twlight's a good student,  but she's still just a student.  Celestia is definitely much more powerful than her.

I figure that growing to god size takes longer than a regular pony's growth.  Presumably she'll start growing again now,  but there's no telling if growing to Celestia size will only take a few years or the better part of a millennium.

            And that's another confusing thing: The sisters looked the same size in that book Twilight read at the beginning,  but was it really a case of Luna's growth being stunted,  or did the artist,  who may not have had the best look at them anyway,  decide to make them look more similar just to have it be a little more poetic?

            I dunno,  but on the topic of phoenixes,  their magical fire is often attributed to traveling long distances.  So it would make sense that Celly could use that to transport messages.

            Sorry if my idle speculation gets a little silly sometimes; I think that last one was based on my musings about how many lifetimes the Pevensies could live if they kept pulling off the same Narnian time travel shenanigans.
