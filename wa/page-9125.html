            One thing I have to conclude is that in the time between seasons,  we turn in Pinkie Pie,  spouting non-sequiturs and stuff that makes people stare and wonder,  "What the -BLEEP- are you talking about?" <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">
<p></p>So,  in the spirit of Pinkie Pie,  do you think a crossover event between <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kirby" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kirby">Kirby</a></em> would ever work? I think it could,  because both world are <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarBowl" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarBowl">Sugar Bowls</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VileVillainSaccharineShow" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VileVillainSaccharineShow">Vile Villain, Saccharine Show</a>,  and a lot of people think both franchises are "kiddie" stuff...when they fail to realize that there's some serious non-kiddie stuff in it!
<p></p>I totally think Pinkie and Kirby would make quite a pair with their red and pinkness. That,  and I can totally see Pinkie bouncing Kirby,  thinking that he's a little ball to play with! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">

            Well to be honest my reaction was like "Yeah! Awesome! Aang kicked the crap out of him!"
<p></p>Rewatched it then I was like "Well that was kinda annoying,  first Aang just ran away the whole time,  then Ozai just ran away the whole time. The finale sucked!"
<p></p>Then I thought about and was like "Oh,  there are justifications for as to how to fight went out."

            I just don't see how it being explained automatically makes it enjoyable.
<p></p>So the Avatar is the strongest bender on the planet and has access to thousands of lives worth of power. So? How does that make him curbstomping Ozai enjoyable?
<p></p>The Order Of the White Lotus are master benders. So? How does that make the effortless liberation of Ba Sing Se fun?

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Mm. The show hasn't gotten far enough for me to see Tywin as sympathetic. To me he's just an old bastard.
<p></p>I ask because I was curious of your opinion on a villain I'd been developing for my next fic. If you recall some time ago I mentioned Salem in this thread,   the genocidal hunter? I've been giving some thought to making it clear throughout the story that he knows,   on some level,   that he's evil,   but he's so far gone that he's unable to stop. I like the notion of putting in small moments of self-loathing and the notion that he has literally nothing but his crusade in there.
<p></p>I honestly don't think we have a trope for a villain like that,   someone who's unrepentantly evil,   never makes any attempt to validate or explain their actions,   but still becomes sympathetic.

            For me,  in both cases,  it's because the good guys are finally ending the war. Ba Sing Se,  because it was an important symbolic achievement. Ozai,  because he's an asshat who had it coming.
<p></p>You may not have found that entertaining,  but I sure did.
