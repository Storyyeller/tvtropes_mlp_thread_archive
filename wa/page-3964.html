<p></p>@Ginger,  happy you have yourself a supporter in that field?
<p></p>@Sky,  I have a face palm with your name on it.
<p></p>@Bad,  Oh come on,  she's not a <em>bad</em> person,  just a character who has done terrible things that I personally dislike. Like Rainbow Dash who has done less horrible things and is more of a jerk.

            I think Fluttershy could go either way. On one hand,  she could be the stereotypical skinny hippie girl. But she was also a model,  and judging from the looks some stallions give her,  fairly good-looking in-universe. So I have a tendency to lean towards Bustyshy.

            @ginger She definitely has earth pony in her family. Keeping with my headcanon that she comes from a rich family,  maybe one of her parents is from Canterlot/Manehattan?

            As for humanizations go.  I saw one pic of Twilight Sparkle as an African-American girl and I really liked it,  but it seemed like a lot of people were complaining about it.  I really dont know where Id put her on bust scale though.
<p></p>Pinkie Pie definitely has to be busty and have a big bottom to boot.  With all the stuff she eats there is no way she couldnt.  I dont know a lot of women who have that high metabolism where they can eat anything they want and not baloon out.
<p></p>The others.. hmm.. I dont have good humanized images of them yet.

            @Sky Strike: Why would you think Fluttershy has Earth Pony in her?  When she got her Cutie Mark,  she acted like she'd never been down to the surface before.  Her parents wouldn't be able to live in Cloudsdale with her if one of them was an Earth Pony.
