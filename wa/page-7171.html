            I went to the first Pokemon movie with my brother,  and the theater told us they were out of the Foil Mew trading card game cards.  We wanted to see it anyway so we went into the theater,  and some kids that came in behind us were waving the cards they had just gotten from the ticket booth.  They had lied to us about being out of cards because we were too old in their eyes to want that sort of thing,  we stormed out and complained to a manager and he gave them to us.... begrudgingly.

            I remember spending all my money on Pokemon cards as a kid. Though fortunately,  my parents stopped me from paying $20 for one card. Anyway,  I never got the foil Mew. I just got a Promo Dragonite instead.

            I never collected the cards,  I just played the crap out of the games. I really truly got into the Pokemon scene in the third generation,  then kept porting my crew forward to Sinnoh and then Unova. I still occasionally play the old g3 carts again to get more migration bait.

            There almost certainly would be news stories. Anyway,  I think the cards were probably my first exposure to Pokemon. Someone gave me starter set,  and I think Zap! as well.

            I watched it on and off from Indigo League (Season 1) to Battle Frontier (Season 9). I lost interest in the newer anime at the beginning of the DP Saga,  but I still watch the older episodes that I have on VHS.
