            The main advantage of HTTPS is that it prevents monitoring or altering your traffic (assuming the certs are secure,  which is admittedly problematic in practice). This is most important with a public wifi network as otherwise,  anyone on the network could steal your passwords or interfer with your traffic.

            Time for a midday fanfic report!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Dear Thread Manor...
<p></p>I don't really have a theme for todays stories. They run the gamut from epic action to surprise feels to comedy slice-of-life. So lets jump in at the action side! Then those surprise feels,  then the comedy!
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62041/the-god-empress-of-ponykind">The God Empress of Ponykind<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> -in progress. The God Emperor of Mankind finally awakes from the Golden Throne,  in order to stop the forces of Chaos laying siege to Holy Terra and take the fight to the Chaos Gods themselves in The Immaterium. After a long,  grueling series of battles,  the God Emperor stands triumphant over the 4 Chaos Gods,  and lets himself be taken by a warp storm so that this new age can proceed on it's own without His influence. Except the warp storm didn't kill Him. He instead finds himself on a barren,  volcanic world in the form of a xenos. Specifically,  a strange horse creature with a white coat,  a horn,  wings,  and a flowing,  ethereal mane...
<p></p>this is an Equestria origins story with a bit of a twist on it.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/47908/life-is-a-lemon">Life is a Lemon<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> -in progress. Lemon Dreams is a very happy pony. Well,  she wouldn't quite agree with that statement because she's convinced she's not a pony. She's a lemon,  and nopony can convince her otherwise. But she really is very happy! She lives on her lemon orchard with all her brothers and sisters(the lemons) and everything is perfect for her! But such a delusion of lemonhood could not have come about naturally. What could have possibly happened in her past to make her believe she is a lemon?...
<p></p>oh geez,  this only has a Slice-of-Life tag,  but don't believe it. It starts off comedic and lighthearted,  but then it gets real heavy feels real fast.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/68414/quizzical">Quizzical<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Quizzical Greystone is a very drab yet brilliant filly. She has a simple light grey/dark gray color scheme,  her interests are purely scientific(her cutie mark is a Venn Diagram),  and calling her voice monotone would be an insult to the word. Because of all this,  she makes pre-Ponyville Twilight look like a social butterfly. On a suggestion from Luna,  Celestia assigns her as assistant friendship researcher to Twilight in the hopes that she'll learn a thing or two.
<p></p>This one is mostly comedy/slice of life with some drama near the end. It's a nice story overall.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/36773/fur-and-feathers">Fur and Feathers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> -in progress. Twilight botches a spell and turns everyponies pets into ponies.Turning them back is beyond Twilight's abilities,  so they have to wait for the Summer Sun Celebration in a week when Celestia will be in town so she can fix it. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
<p></p>This is a fun one. From Gummi having just as much reality breaking powers as Pinkie,  to Opal being a completely unrepentant jerkass,  there's laughs to be had by all!

            Yes I didn't  liked anime pcitures everywhere,  but  if picture fit trope it should be there.  Better any picture even from something  I dislike than no picture,  of course if picture work for that page.
<p></p>I want  Elements Of Harmony to be used again. Mostly because I want to see all those magical rainbow stuff doing something awesome again.  Or at least Rainbow Dash doing  Sonic Rainboom again or something similar.

            Personally I don't care whether trope pictures are from anime,  mlp,  Video games,  whatever. as long as the trope is represented well.
<p></p>Also how come MLP:<a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a> is the only work that has a dedicated list of pages that it provides the image for? (and by extension one for former images)?

            So as I was saying earlier,  we're nearly finished this season.  I hope that we don't have to have the same long wait for new pony that we did last time (because lets face it,  that nearly killed this thread. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">).  And I certainly hope that FIM won't be ending soon.
<p></p>OK,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">long runners</a> have a habit of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">going bad</a>,  but as <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a> showed,  that can take a long time in itself.  I for one hope that FIM is still going into the middle of the decade.  Worse shows than it have in the past,  and Hasbro can actually make money of it,  so it could happen.

<p></p>Unfortunately,  with that being what it is,  there will eventually be a point where all of the mane six can be considered responsible and happy adults,  with little in way of character flaws to develop,  and I think we might be hitting that spot faster than I'd like.
<p></p>Especially since Hasbro makes more money of reruns than new content,  I believe.

            I'd kinda rather have them go to maybe like five seasons,  give us a good finale,  and then move on.  Putting in a new cast or setting would give us something fresh and give them some more opportunities to do new stuff with the franchise.
