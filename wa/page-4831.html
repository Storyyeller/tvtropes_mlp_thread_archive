            Not to mention that in this episode Twilight was sleep deprived the whole time,  which makes her freakout a bit more understandable.

            The episode <em>began</em> with her freaking out about having not scheduled enough time to make another schedule.  It can't all be blamed on sleep deprivation.
<p></p>Yeah,  Lesson Zero was where the flanderization began,  but I was hoping it would be a one-off thing.  As it stands now though,  I think OCD Twilight is here to stay.

            Twilight's freakout here was way more reasonable than her freakout in Lesson Zero.  If my future self bent the laws of time to try and give me a warning I'd take it pretty damn seriously too.  It isn't her fault future her went back for an inane reason.
<p></p>Er,  okay,  so it is her fault.  But still!

            Sleep deprivation is responsible for that poor judgement call but of course Future!Twilight is responsible for that too.

            I'm not complaining about the freakout tho.  I'm worried about all the stuff that happened <em>before</em> Future!Twilight even showed up.  "I forgot to leave time to make my next schedule" and all that.
<p></p>Okay,  great,  Twi is organized.  It doesn't need to be her whole personality,  or something she throws fits about.

            Well,  I finally watched the new episode and it didn't hold my attention that much. The humour just doesn't click,  the plot feels weak and unlike past episodes for reasons that I can't put my fingers on,  and everything just seems so random. Cerberus and Tartarus,  Celestia showing up,  etc. Not to mention time travelling being something very easy to do. But most of all I just don't like that the episode runs on Twilight freaking out over something,  and begins with Twilight freaking out over organization in the most OCD manner possible.
<p></p>I thought it might just be that I'm not part of the target demography,  but I think eight year old me would go so far as hate this episode,  especially in light of the others. Anyway,  it's just ok.

            @Seraphem - No,  but every time there's a stealth scene in this show I always instinctually compare it to Metal Gear.
<p></p>I also couldn't help being bothered that Pinkie hid on the wrong side of the curtain.

            Yeah I think the point was that Twilight was overworrying it again.   She was Princess Celestia's faithful student,  she wasn't going to do anything unethical with the spells (I presume if there was a spell to stop time she wouldn't have used it if it wasn't reversible).  Spike pointed out how pointless sneaking around was.

            With Twilight,  it's easier to not ask.
<p></p>And they probably know if she's looking to get into the library in the middle of the night,  it must be something important.
<p></p>Or at the very least,  they know she's not a scroll thief.

            Given how she once raised the sun from the top of a stage for a previous Summer Sun Celebration,  I don't think it matters <em>where</em> she does it from. It's not like she's physically dragging the sun up from the horizon,  just sort of channeling magic towards it,  I guess.

            also,  I always figured she could do it anywhere she wanted,  the only time we've seen her do it was at a celebration of the event,  so she made a big public show of it. But after millennia of it,  most day's she might just roll out of bed and pop it up while showering or something it's so normal for her.
<p></p>.....and given the above pony porn and solar viagra comments..that could have been phrased better.
