            It wouldn't just be a live chat. Presumably we'll also talk about the episode in thread. That was in fact the original intention.

            grr I cant remember the name of that program.  You could stream a video,  and in the foreground there were silhouettes of people sitting in an audience,  and you could chat with each other while the video was playing.
<p></p>Was a text chat overlay on a video player.
<p></p>Would be great to host events where we could play a video and everyone could chat real time about it.

            Yeah,  it's more just to keep the thread going strong in between seasons.  Another thing I was thinking is that we could set up a regular text chat during the episode stream and sort of MST the episode,  and maybe paste it to the thread after for those who are interested.

            I think that the physical copies of FOE are more legit than other fan-works like the plushies.  They're not being sold for profit.
<p></p>Also,  they were going to fix the typos and stuff,  but the author asked them not to,  because she doesn't want multiple versions of the story floating out there.

<p></p>About ponies... Well,  what's the next episode that comes out? Is it the Spike episode or the Fluttershy episode? What do you expect from it? I wonder when and how Twilight will reveal the existence of her brother...

            Kegi said it looks like an adoption episode.  Which makes a lot of sense.  Apparently Spike is going to question his existance and seek answers.
<p></p>They also said that ponies dont know much about dragons because they are big and scary and rare.
<p></p>I have a feeling we are going to find out that they arent so scary perhaps?
<p></p>The two dragons we have encountered so far have both been Jerks... but maybe they are the more eccentric members or their species?

            @ginger From the recap page:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Spike joins the Great Dragon Migration on a journey of self-discovery,  but when he meets a tough and tumble gang of teenage dragons,  Spike wonders if they have the key to the various questions that he has about his identity. </div>
<p></p>I still like the idea of greaser dragons,  maybe with switchblade claws. And hopefully we could get an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOutsiders" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOutsiders">Outsiders</a> shoutout.
<p></p>Also,  her latest voice sounded a bit like the one from "Green Isn't Your Color". And it definitely didn't sound black.
