            Right... man,  Izzy was my favourite,  how did I forget him? Well,  my favourite next to Joe anyways.
<p></p>so:
<p></p><ul><li>Ty: Courage
</li><li>Matt: Friendship
</li><li>TK: Hope
</li><li>Mimi: Sincerity
</li><li>Sora: Love
</li><li>Kari: Light
</li><li>Joe: Reliability
</li><li>Izzy: Knowledge
</li></ul><p></p>okay now... Ginger,  if you really hate me going in depth your gonna wanna look away,  because these crests are more complicated that they seem
<p></p><ul><li>Courage:
</li></ul>the big thing about courage was that you couldn't get it by just running in like an idiot. It was the willingness to fight for something you cared about in spite of the odds. It was a dedication to yourself.
<p></p>Twilight was the last to fall to Discord,  and the first to snap out of it. She never stopped beleiving in her friends,  and never stopped fighting. She has the crest of courage.
<p></p><ul><li>Friendship:
</li></ul>A fairly nebulous one; Matt earned it by being there for his friend(as I recall),  when they were hurt. Friendship symbolized unconditional love,  and the willingness to give yourself for another.
<p></p>Rarity is more than willing to give of herself,  even if she can seem selfish. When push comes to shove she's the last one on her mind. She has the element of friendship.
<p></p><ul><li>Hope:
</li></ul>TK was the weakest fo the group,  and he knew it. But he put his faith in his friends,  and used that to get through - and in turn,  his friends drew strength from that. Hope is the ability to inspire others,  and to rely on them
<p></p>Pinkie is insecure on her own,  but strong with others. She lends her strength through them. She has the element of hope.
<p></p><ul><li>Sincerity:
</li></ul>Mimi got the crest of sincerity by admitting her faults. It's the ability to care about yourself,  but more importantly to know your flaws and work in spite of them
<p></p>Luna knows what she did is wrong,  and she's sorry. But she never lets it hold her down,  and she doesn't live in the past - instead,  she works to overright it. Luna has the crest of sincerity.
<p></p><ul><li>Love:
</li></ul>Love is the ability to be compassionate,  even when you don't like the person you have to be compassionate for. Sora had issues with her friends,  but that didn't stop her from caring.
<p></p>Fluttershy loves everyone and everything. She can't bring herself to be mean,  or even speak harhsly. She has the crest of love.
<p></p>Light:
Light is the ability to inspire,  and to lead.
<p></p>Celestia is the leader of a nation,  and a symbol of love to all. She has the crest of light.
<p></p><ul><li>Reliability:
</li></ul>Joes had little to no self-esteem,  and he believed that he was weak. But he would still leap into danger to sav his friends,  and he did his best to protect them. Reliability is being there,  even if you don't think you can do anything. It's being there to support them,  and help where you can.
<p></p>Dash has serious insecurity issues,  but she would never abandon her firends,  or her home. She has the crest of reliability.
<p></p><ul><li>Knowledge:
</li></ul>Izzy didn't get the crest for being smart,  or he would have had it from the start. He got it from <em>aplying</em> his knowledge. It's the ability to use what you know,  and to use it well. Knowledge symblizes the ability to improvise.
<p></p>AJ may not know much,  but what she knows she knows. She uses the skills she has for the widest range,  and though she may not be flashy she's good for every situation. AJ is the crest of knowledge.
<p></p>I'm probably talking out my ass with half of those - It's been a long time since I saw the series.
<p></p>aaaaaand we've probably moved waaay along by now. Oh well.

<p></p>Nah,  I'm glad you went in depth on that one. I figured most of my initial choices were far too obvious anyway. Thinking about it a bit more,  I pretty much came to the same conclusions you did,  but there's no way in HELL I would've been able to explain myself properly,  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16"> So I'm glad SOMEONE could. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_wink.png" height="16" width="16" alt="wink" title="wink">

            Kindness... I do not remember the crest of kindness <em>at all</em>. Like I said,  it's been years since I've seen the series. I mostly remember what I do from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesuOtaku" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesuOtaku">Jesu Otaku</a>'s retrospective of it. Who got the element of kindness?
<p></p>But I suppose you could apply it to spike - if nothing else he's always there,  and he's a pretty nice guy. He seems to get along with everyone,  and his only rudemoment are friendly jabs at Twilight,  or to break her out of a funk.

You have to be dedicated to someone to care that much about them.

            I'd give Friendship to Rainbow Dash,  possibly because Rainbow is my favourite pony and Matt was my favourite Digidestined.
<p></p>Reliability should really go to Applejack since she is "The most dependable of ponies in Ponyville".
<p></p>But I don't think Rarity should have Knowledge,  so I got nothing there.

            Right... okay,  let me see if I remember this.
<p></p>Ken got the crest after wormomon sacrificed himself to save Ken. Ken went a-wandering,  eventually finding Wormomon's egg,  and getting him back.
<p></p>I think his crest came from his desire for penance. He stayed away from the team,  distancing himself so that he could try and earn forgiveness. Through his penance he gained compassion. Even at the beginning,  to be loved was what he <em>really</em> wanted,  the dark spore just corrupted the desire into one to be feared. So on the whole,  the crest of kindness came both from his desire to change,  and his desire to make things better - Kindness is a wholistic crest. It represents idealism,  and the desire to make things good for everyone.
<p></p>Spike wants to make things better for his friends. Sure,  he wants stuff for himself on occasion - but the only time we see him really,  truly desire something,  it's to be shown love. He even gets jelaous when someone takes away from that love. He wants life to be good for Twilight,  and he wants her to love him as well. Thus,  Spike gets the crest of Kindness.
<p></p>BAM!
