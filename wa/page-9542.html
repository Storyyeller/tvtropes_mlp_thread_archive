            I'm pretty sure that most of the posters (myself included) have stated that we have no intention of no longer posting here.  I'm pretty sure the people who contribute the most (other than Ginger,  obviously) aren't going anywhere.
<p></p>Also,  the forum seems to be working fine.

            I haven't been posting much because I've been working hard to try and get the new chapter of A Still More Glorious Dawn Awaits out the door this weekend. It's a little stressful and a lot time consuming. Fortunately it's in the "pass it on to my editors" stage. Unfortunately,  I've still got to go back and make a whole bunch of little corrections to the previous chapters so I'm still busy.

<p></p>Okay,  here's a pony related topic.  What are your favorite/least favorite bits of fanon?  I'm a big fan of Derpy being Dinky's mother,  and I really dislike all the Cupcakes related stuff.

            I thought of a pony topic.  I know that Applejack's favorite fruit is probably apples,  since she farms them and hasn't shown any signs of feeling like she's tired of them (the "I wanted to try cherries for a change" thing in The Last Roundup was more her excuse for working at the cherry orchard because she didn't want to admit she didn't get the prize money).  But I was wondering,  what would the others' favorite fruits be?  This isn't just the Mane Six,  this could include others too if you can think of favorite fruits for the others.
<p></p>Strawberries are often associated with a pink color,  at least in candies,  so that might be Pinkie Pie's favorite.  I kind of associate Rarity with raspberries because they're often seen as a "purple" fruit and because her name sounds a little like raspberry.  And Rainbow Dash might like apples best because they come in so many different colors so they're kind of like a rainbow fruit,  especially the zap apples they have in canon.
<p></p>Speaking of the zap apples,  I wonder if Equestria has any other unusual types of fruits?
<p></p>Edit: About the fanon question,  probably my least favorite is the Trollestia/Molestia/Tyrantlestia stuff.  I don't dislike the idea of Dinky being Derpy's daughter,  but I don't personally use it in my own planned fanfic (Derpy doesn't have any biological foals in my story but she's Pinkie's wife and Pinkie has three biological foals so they're also Derpy's kids too).  I'm also ambivalent about the "Rainbow Dash is gay" thing.  I don't mind stories that have her be a lesbian because of her relationship with another character,  but I don't like the idea that she's the designated lesbian pony because of her personality and mane color.

            I dislike most of the nasty bits; i.e. Cupcakes!Pinkie,  Scootabuse,  that kind of stuff.  My favorite bit of fanon is probably Lyra's human obsession.   I have no idea why the idea of a pony cryptozoologist obsessed with humans amuses me so much.
<p></p>Also,  I think Pinkie's favorite fruit would be a durian.  The idea of her carting a bunch of them into town is hilarious.

            Well Carrot Top also has the whole foil for Derpy thing going on.  Though I haven't seen as much of that lately.

            I'm actually disinclined to call cupcakes and anything of the sort fanon.
<p></p>I'm kinda hardpressed to find something that's my <em>favourite</em> about general fanon,  mostly since a lot of it I disregard in favour of my own,  which I can tweak to how I want. But I'd say <em>probably</em> my favourite element of fanon would be Lyra and Bon Bon as a couple. Least favourite falls between Lyra's human obsession and dumbass derpy. It always gets on my nerves when a single 'trait' of a character gets blown into the only thing people care about about them. Lyra's had potential to be interesting but I feel it's overdone,  and I've never cared for the notion of Derpy being seen as dumb simply because she's wall-eyed.

<p></p>Unusual fruit? You mean like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">COMBUSTABLE LEMONS?</a>
<p></p>As for fanon,  I have a love-hate relationship with the idea of modern technology in Equestria. I usually want to handwave it by saying that the technology exists,  but most of the ponies in Ponyville prefer to live simply.

            My favorite bit of Fanon is that Scootaloo is an Apple family bastard that was raised by Timberwolves.  It doesnt exist outside of this thread though.

            @Keg: Yeah,  I think it depends how it's utilized.  I like the human thing when it's treated as one of Lyra's quirks among her other attributes,  but when it's the defining point of her personality it gets annoying.

            I think Lyra's human obsession works best when coupled with Bon Bon,  since it lets her balance things out a bit and be the straight mare.  Well,  not straight,  you know what I mean.

I've never understood why people get shocked about this. One of his first scenes in the whole series involved a back and forth with AJ.

            @Ferguard: My take on the power of love thing is that hey,  Friendship is literally Magic,  and you could easily call love a type of friendship.  Or you could just say that Cadence was using her magic to buff SA or something.
<p></p>Or you could just read <a class="urllink" href="http://japaneseteeth.deviantart.com/#/d4xsvh2">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to get the rest of my thoughts on it.
