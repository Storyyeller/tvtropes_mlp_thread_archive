            There's also the fact that being a member of the fandom already,  it seems a bit redundant.  I probably already know 90% of what the documentary talks about.  As said,  this isn't necessarily aimed at people who are already familiar with the fandom; it's an introduction.  I want to watch insofar as I want to see how it handled things,  but I'm not really eager to see it because I think it'll be particularly entertaining or educational for me.

            I'm a little surprised their charging for it though,  since the idea was to educate non bronies. But if they're not a fan,  they're even less likely to pay for it.

            I really liked that article about what the show looks like to a colorblind person.  As someone who lives with and loves dogs,  it made me think about how the show would look to them,  since dogs are also red-green colorblind like that person.  And,  as it mentions in the article,  to real horses who might watch the screen when the show is playing.

            Story: Well,  the alternatives were either to not make a living or to cut funding and make the documentary worse.
<p></p>Teeth: Fair enough.  I guess I'm excited because I have people to show it to.
<p></p>EDIT: <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> Although that's not the theatre's fault.  They make a very,  very small profit on the tickets.

            Actually,  you know what? "The Round Stable" has a ton of really awesome articles about the show and the fanbase,  and I reccomend that you all should check it out whenever you can. Here's a couple more great articles from that site.

<p></p>Occasionally,  but they're rarely that expensive. I suppose it mainly depends on which theater you go to,  how recent the movie is,  and whether it's in 3d or not.

            To add to Lurker: Even more up here in Canada.  For new releases,  regular DVDs are $20 and BluRays anywhere from $30-40.  Add $20 more for each of special collector's edition and 3D.  Bargain bin stuff is often $5 for DVDs and $10 for BluRays,  but that's stuff from 10+ years ago.

            Got around to watching the episode.
<p></p>I did appreciate that they handled it intelligently for the most part.  Nobody (save perhaps Fluttershy at times,  though it was also cool that they basically came right out and said she's nowhere near as naive as she lets on) was really deluding themselves about playing with srs bsns,  and there was a very clear probation vibe at the end.  The climax felt rushed,  but 22 minutes.
<p></p>Loved the spinning house gag.  That pretty much made the episode. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            @story Depends on the movie,  but anywhere from once to several times,  leaning heavily toward the latter.
<p></p>I'm not especially interested in the documentary,  though. Probably not going to get it until I actually start getting something like the season <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDs">DVDs</a>/comics,  though I am considering getting those.

            If anything,  the existence of "reforming spells" is kind of...creepy though.  Granted I'm not surprised Twilight would try to jump for that,  but I get the feeling (or at least hope) Celestia would have some very dignified choice words about therapy-by-mind-rape.

<p></p>Especially the comics
<p></p>and for those not sure about the commentary yet. They do plan to release it on Netflix as soon as they can. Some paperwork issues they have to deal with first. So can just wait till then.

            The comics are good,  yeah.  Not interested in the documentary — I saw Jan's animation from it,  and while his work is top notch as usual the writing is a little too hokey for my tastes.

            Well,  considering that she had to research across tons of books to find single page bits of information on it,  I'd say that it's more likely that it's a spell that is discussed in theory rather than anything officially documented. Twilight knows a memory spell,  after all,  so we know that mind-altering magic exists,  and that the implications of such magic would then be fully explored in theory if not in practice.

            @ Apple: Judging by the fact that it's implied that there's a lot of reform spells,  Twilight mentions I believe not being able to find a single one and many books had pages torn out,  I'm going to assume that it works by changing the target's morality to one dictated by the original creator of the spell,  not the one the using it. Otherwise there would likely only need to be one.
<p></p>Alternatively it may be that the different ones are for different races,  but in said case why would Discord need to deal with all of them? Of course there is the possibility that since he's made of many animals he may be susceptible to any one.
<p></p>Personally I believe that such a spell would have little chance of actually effecting a creature with as much power as Discord,  hence why it would be the back up rather than the primary plan,  and Discord was merely covering his bases on the off chance that it could work.
