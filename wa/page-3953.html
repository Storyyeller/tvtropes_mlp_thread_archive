            No,  she was in that situation in the first place because she lived a shallow,  meaningless life that killed her ability to make decisions.  By the time she realized it,  the only decision she had left was how to die.  She never learned,  or else forgot,  the things that were really important.  Her story was the story of Equestria in miniature.

            I <em>seriously</em> can't blame <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Diamond Tiara</span> for doing that.
<p></p>But I think it might be more that most ponies tried to do their best without realising that another pony's actions mean that they're just making everything worse.
<p></p>I'm pretty much tone deaf myself.
<p></p>Anyway,  my swimming abilities. My sister is an excellent swimmer. Webs run in my family (I also have them). However,  I can't swim well. I get lapped in galas. And in matric,  I had to wear a bright orange T-shirt to alert the lifegaurds that I was a poor swimmer (that was embarrasing).
