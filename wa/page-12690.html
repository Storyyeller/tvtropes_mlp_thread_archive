            @JT: Dashie is kinda qualified,  but they need to make sure entirely. Also they probably want her to shape her character/attitude up a bit before actually graduating her.

            Here's something I just thought up:
<p></p>What happened the few times the Wonderbolts were deployed for rescue missions? They got knocked out by the pony they were rescuing and,  while able to get it's attention,  were captured by a dragon. Maybe Spitfire is really trying to push the new recruits because she noticed that the Wonderbolts have become lax and there have been a lack of quality in new recruits in recent years. The reason why she demoted Lightning Dust is because while they are stunt flyers and racers,  they are also deployed to protect ponies and based on Lightning Dust's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">Lack of Empathy</a>,  she isn't capable of that.

            Again,  I actually liked Spitfire's character in today's episode,  mostly because she reminded me a bit of my mom (she was a drill seargant in the Army around Vietnam). How long has it been since Twi's actually used that balloon to get around,  anyway?

            I know that many people point out that Spitfire couldn't see what was going on,  but really she should know what is going on. She should have been observing the courses or weather duty,  or at least have had some of her subordinates doing so. Its not like this stuff was taking place out of sight behind quarters or something this was out in the open.
<p></p>I think what irked me most about Spitfire being an instructor was not that she was an instructor but that in the scheme of thins she was a pretty bad one. Not bothering to keep appraised of what is going on in her own camp,  and being only interested in results.

            I think it could be reasonably argued that Spitfire could only know so much due to the distances involved. In the obstacle course she was probably relying on the obstacle crews to be her eyes,  and while they were busting clouds it was likely just a chore so she could easily go inside to do some paperwork. Not like she expected a tornado.
<p></p>I imagine the reason it took her a while to catch up with Dash at the end was because she was fact-checking on that last bit to make sure she didn't do anything rash.

            @Seraphem: That still doesn't speak well of the academy if the Commandant has to hear about an accident from one of her cadets,  and that the Commandant's subordinates couldn't be bothered to do anything about it.

            @Mio,  she did not have TIME to learn about it any other way. how is she supposed to know when the very first pony to tell her was RD,  and she went RIGHT TO HER immediately after the incident? when was she supposed to have developed telepathy?

            Finally I can talk about the show yay.
<p></p>I'm with Mio on this one.  While its understandable that Spitfire had to push the cadets.  It was also a failure on her part to rein in the Lightning Dust when she started endangering the other cadets.  What's worse because of Spitfire's failure at the end of the show Lightning Dust isn't even given a warning but has the lead flier role taken away and possibly booted out of flight camp.
<p></p>Though it was awesome that Rainbow Dash was able to shine and be a nice pony.

            @Seraphem: She should have heard it from one of her subordinates and they should have been their to try to deal with the tornado and help rescue the Mane Six. The fact that they did not immediately restrained Dash and Dust and take them to Spitfire shows thatb there was a lack of <em>anypony</em> looking out for what was going on shows that the program has issues.
