            And what would she NEED to improve? Stop acting like this is some big bucking competition,  it's NOT. Stop geting upset beause some cliched chaper  in <em>The Big Book of How Stories Work</em> got trashed in favor of having them be realistic. other then the being ponies and magic thing,  in what way does ANYTHING your upset about not almost exactly measure up to how it would work in reality?

            I wasn't really a fan of her bridesmaid's dresses.
<p></p>and she kept AJ from wearing her hat,  that's just not the done thing to do. (I think her outfit looks BETTER when she has the hat on anyway)
<p></p>then again,  I really liked the capes she made in Secret Of My Excess (but I'm still pissed that she didn't make one for Spike) XD

            @ ginger..it's still pastel magical ponies,  the setting is still well worth escaping into,  just stop getting upset if it doesn't work the way "stories" are supposed to,  the episodes (for the most part) aren't stories,  there just windows into these ponies real lives.

            @Seraph I don't want to escape from one world into another UNFAIR world,  where some are just BORN better than others (or with more inherant potential than others) and it's treated as a good thing.

            I think that Applejack <em>is</em> improving. However,  the physical part of that is less obvious than the mental part. In season 2,  she lets RD do something for her that she could have done herself (the demolishing),  admits that she'd already learned what she needed to know in SSCS 6000 and in A Canterlot Wedding,  accepts that somepony might not like her treats graciously. This is a big improvement from season 1.
