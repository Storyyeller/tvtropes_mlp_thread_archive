            So yeah,  watched it again this morning. The more I think about it,  the more I feel that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKXlhpeb6wI">this is a more-or-less accurate description of my feelings.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<p></p>I mean,  really,  it had great moments. In fact,  it was nothing but great moments. But once the initial shine wears off,  I notice that the moments simply don't add up into a compelling narrative. First that blatant <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">Remember the New Guy</a>,  then none of the Mane 6 besides Twilight contributing to the story,  topped off by a rather sudden resolution by these two new ponies that I simply can't care for because I hardly know them.
<p></p>I blame the fact that they tried to cram a feature-length movie in only 44 minutes. They cut out everything that wasn't not directly related to the plot or any other hallmarks of a good Disney film<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> kudos for including a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong">Villain Song</a></div></span>,  including the parts where the new characters should have been properly introduced,  or where the characters we do know get to actually contribute.
<p></p>So yeah,  great ambitions,  good execution,  but killed by time constraints. Such. A. Shame. Well,  at least it was better than the Nightmare Moon two-parter,  but it certainly didn't beat out Discord.

            My only complaint is that I feel the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Love conquers all"</span> resolution was too abrupt.

            I'm staying at my parent's house at the moment. I decided to stay in Canterlot for a bit after my weekly therapy session to attend the wedding. It was scary! But the changelings were fascinating. Wish that I had a better chance to study them. Well,  I'm happy for Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and Captain Shining Armour Sparkle.

            Well Ace of Scarabs,  I wasn't around Princess Mi Amore Cadenza very much,  so I didn't get the oppertunity to study her behaviour much,  but I'd like to think that I would have noticed that she was acting strange even if I haven't seen her much since she was <em>my</em> foal-sitter (she does it for several noble families).
<p></p>Maybe she replaced her bridesmaids because they noticed? I hear that Lyra Heartstrings lives in Ponyville now. Maybe I should ask her.

            Only part that was kinda narmish to me was when she said "My love will give you the strength" yeah that was kinda,  ughhh. But the actual resolution,  it was great,  the show already makes it clear that <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a> is insanely powerful in this world,  If it was the EOH that defeated her,  no one would have minded as much,  but even the EOH are powered by love,  the love between Friends. Romantic love is one step above this,  so stands to reason it could be even more powerful.
<p></p>Further,  all <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a> did was give SA a boost in power enogh to erect the shield and send the Changelings flying,  with Cadance's help. It wasn't some abstract power,  it was simply Cadances and SA's feeling for each other allowing them to combine there magic. Yes in almost any other setting it would be ridiculous,  but in this one it works.
<p></p>Yeah would have loved it to be lengthened,  but have to allow some lee-way for constraints inherent to the medium,  is it 100% perfect,  no. But overall it was as close as they could get. and while it does have it's flaws,  none of them are big or glaring enough to takes away from the overall amazing job everyone did on it.
