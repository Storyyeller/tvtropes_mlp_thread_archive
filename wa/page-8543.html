            ok,  time to watch some more ponies in between E3 conferences...The Cutie Pox
<p></p>Pony bowling,  huh?
<p></p>yay,  more zekora! She bothered me at first,  but I dunno,  I guess disappearing for the rest of season 1 was just the thing to get me to like her again!
<p></p>a french cutie mark!?
<p></p>HOLD IT! That old pony playing chess with applebloom...why does he look familiar...
<p></p>Those are some...odd cutie marks. Though the french one is still the strangest.
<p></p>hey,  applebloom isn't speaking french anymore!

            I figured that all the cutie marks were really weird because they weren't really natural. <br>Also,  it's spelled Zecora. With a C. <br> <br>I think Cutie Pox is one of my favorite CMC episodes. Even if it's mostly about Apple Bloom.

            Antoine  was interesting as cowardly former guard/solder,  so much room for character development,  to bad they never went that way. And later made him kid in time of  Robotnik take over.
<p></p>I don't like character overshadowing rest of cast. And Twilgiht so far have only second number of ideas,  after  AJ ideas for stories.
<p></p>Blueblood would fit role of Antoine but somehow I don't want to use him.

<p></p>I like the CMC getting individual spotlight,  I just kinda wished they'd get more <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivergentCharacterEvolution" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivergentCharacterEvolution">Divergent Character Evolution</a> from it. Both Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle are likeable in their respective episodes,  but their roles seem more circumstantial than brought from their personality (eg. Sweetie Belle having a less experienced sister,  Applebloom being Zecora's assistant). Otherwise all three are near interchangable <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">Bratty Half-Pint</a> Butt Monkeys,  which is likeable,  but doesn't give a lot of chemistry.
<p></p>@Death Cloud: I personally think Blast To The Past screwed up a lot of the backstory for the sake of 'Freedom Fighter Babies'.

            @Death Cloud: I think it would have worked better if they had just gone with the original show bible idea of him doing it a year or so before the events of the show,  especially since by this point Robotnik was becoming a Bond Level blundering villain and it became less plausible he could keep hold of his power for over a decade without doing something stupid to leave an opening.

<p></p>One problem I could see connecting Sally and Twilight is that they have troubling potential of being a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> and rendering other characters redundant. Sally was <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a>,  strategist and hacking expert,  and by second season stole Rotor's mechanic role. A problem sometimes made with Twilight's magic is how versatile it is,  she can emulate almost any other ponies key abilities to some extent (par maybe RD's flying and speed,  but even then her teleport can make it redundant at times,  again Dragon Quest).

            I need to comeup with something for RD,  beyong being fighting with enemy,  Especially when she don't have same uncle like  Sonic had (I don't likle making OC family member for canon characters).
<p></p>@Psi 001 Don't worry. Twilight is less magic (because she not well trained as canon Twily, ) and is focused on being leader and strategist.  AJ would have  Team Mom role (wasn't that original role of Bunny?)
<p></p>And mechanic/tech genius would be other character.
