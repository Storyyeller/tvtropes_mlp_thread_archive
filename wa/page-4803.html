            Yeah,  I imagine that they pour lots of money into keeping the farm from destructing after stuff like Parasprites eating the barn and whatnot.  The other thing is that I think the setting of the show is as a rule more idealistic than ours,  so the economy works for them when it wouldn't work for us.

            Mousa is correct,  I certainly have been a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a> fan since long before the newest series was even thought of.  I think I may have first watched it when I was 4 or 5,  and I still have a very old plastic lunchbox that has G1 ponies on it that I still use as a general box.  The G1 series definitely had an influence on some of the characters I created when I was in elementary school,  particularly their names (I'm still a fan of weird names like the ponies have) and the idea of a vain character who would sing the "Look At Me" song from the Glass Princess story.
<p></p>Speaking of which,  a character like Porcina could be an interesting villainous counterpart for Rarity; someone who is always bragging about her (or his?) looks and wants to turn the world into glass or mirrors so that his/her reflection is everywhere.

            My pony playlists consist of pretty much anything that tickles my fancy: well-made pony music videos,  pony fan animations,  Pony Thread Simulators,  the occasional moment of celebrities pandering to the fans,  hilarious (or hilariously dark) videos... Pretty much the works!
<p></p>Hell,  I'm not even stopping collecting the videos! I've just made a 3rd playlist for PONIES!

            Well picking up from where I left off,  I kept thinking (<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">always a good sign for me</a>) and said to myself,  "you know if I were an Earth Pony I would be,  just a <em>tiny bit</em> piss with the royal/Divine Family/government."
<p></p>If you recall from multiple past episodes we know this:
<p></p>1. Celestia/Luna although always or at least for most of pony civilization were worshiped,  but not they did always rule Equestria,  or what is now formally recognized as Equestria,  <em>directly</em>.
<p></p>2.We know that they were all split in three governing bodies by pony types: pegasuses were ruled by military dictatorship under a Genralissimo,  Unicorns were ruled under a traditional Absolute monarchy (no evidence that there was any kind of "real" assembly under this monarch),  and the earth Ponies had a chancellor...who would presumably have been elected by a representative body  either democratically or by oligarchs or whatever (<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdolfHitler" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdolfHitler">and yes I'm aware that certain democratically elected chancellors don't stay democratic</a>).
<p></p>3. So my two questions are(again):
<p></p>1. What form of government was used between the time of the newly formed tripartite Republic(?)/Kingdom(?)/United States(?) of Equestria and the takeover by the God-Empresses?
<p></p>2. How much of an impact did the first appearance of Discord have on this transition/coup if any(assuming that they didn't already have direct/autocratic control of Equestria)?
<p></p>And damn! How does your deity one day just up and go "well we're just gonna sort of become more involved...<em>for a millennium or so</em>, " I can see if they were always in that role but they weren't so I've always speculated on the full extent of the alicorns' power. I'm also assuming that there's an even more powerful being (I'm hoping Lauren Faust's alicorn avatar) that created Celestia/Luna,  the universe,  etc. I really did over think this if you can't tell<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">.
