            They'd try really,  really hard to convince you,  but I mean,  what exactly would forcing you into it do? It'd give a questionable test result,  for a start. "Patient had a resting heart rate of 90BPM" is a bit dubious when the patient was being forced there.
<p></p>There's just no logical reason <em>not</em> to ask you,  really.

            But even so,  ya have to feel for Orion going through all of that,  being tested and observed like that,  it's just not right even if they asked him for permission. Quite frankly I don't want to think about something like testing him if that were to happen to him,  it's horrible.

            @Turtlebutter: I may be wrong,  but the second favorites collection may not come to Toys R Us until September 17th.  It still only lists it as a pre-order item,  and says that the shipping date is September 17,  so that's when I would guess that it will come out.
<p></p>@Kegisak on Sweetie Belle: Your description of her is basically why she's my favorite of the CMC and one of my favorite characters on the show in general.  I mainly like how honest she is,  like how she was the one who wanted to tell Applejack and then Rarity about Babs being a bully.  Yes,  she's also rather ditzy and clumsy,  but that simply adds to her adorable charm (and makes her a good foil for Rarity).
<p></p>@if I appeared in Equestria: Probably be surprised as to how it could be possible,  and I would be curious to find out how it happened in the first place and depending on how long I'm stuck there,  find a place to stay.  It would also depend on whether or not I would still be a human or if I would be turned into a pony,  being a pony would be harder to adjust to but might be easier in some ways since things in Equestria are made for a pony's body rather than a human.

            There were reports on EQD of them showing up in some stores so Ive been checking once a week to see if they leaked out at mine at all.

<p></p>Also,  I'll probably spring for the favorites thing,  mainly because I've been waiting ever since the S2 finale to have a Chrysalis toy.
<p></p>@Orion: How you'd be tested really depends on where you end up.  In a decent part of the world,  the testing would probably be entirely voluntary,  and you'd probably be compensated in some fashion.

            I pretty much like all the Cutie Mark Crusaders equally. Also I hope we get Babs in season 5,  if it's ever made. Also also,  they should make the  CMC getting their marks into a movie.
