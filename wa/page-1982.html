Besides,  I think being Celestia's student is just a different type of "status" than that which the celebronies are concerned with.

            Yeah,  but even getting in could be apart of the scholarship sytem. Students who do better on the exams could get better scholarships,  etc.
<p></p>But given how useful magic is,  it seems like you'd ant as many skilled,  powerful unicorns as possible. I don't see why they wouldn't give them a little bit of leeway to encourage them to use it as well as possible. Considering what could happen if a poweerful unicorn didn't learn to control it...

<p></p>And yeah,  I'd assumed that if there is a scholarship system,  the entrance exam probably factored into it.  There's probably an application fee to take the test,  with all the payment stuff figured out after she's accepted,  kinda like college.

            Personally,  I'm of the opinion that Twilight probably wasn't all that well known just because she was Celestia's personal student. She had no real friends beyond Spike as far as we can tell,  spent most of her time studying,  and really just doesn't seem to have socialized much at all. I wouldn't be surprised if everyone knew that Celestia DID have a student and maybe would have recognized her or remembered the information if someone actually told them "TS is Celestia's personal student",  but otherwise I don't think it would have been difficult for most ponies to not really have that great a clue about just who she was.

            Me and my brother also discussed how everyone <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInDumbass" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInDumbass">Took a Level in Dumbass</a> for that episode.
<ul><li>They <strong>ALL</strong> should be pretty big names all across Equestria. Season pilot episodes,  anyone?
</li><li>Even if the general public of Equestria suffers from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NOHAMOTYO" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NOHAMOTYO">NOHAMOTYO</a> (though make that two <em><strong>WEEKS</strong></em> instead of <em>years</em>),  Rarity could have just told them all off "Oh,  yes,  they are noponies. Noponies at all. Except that they saved all of your ungrateful flanks from Nightmare Moon and Discord,  you stuck up annoying snobs!"
</li><li>Even then,  atleast Twilight and Fluttershy should be pretty reckognizeable too. One is a personal student of the princess and the other was a big hit model.
</li><li>But really,  they just crashed the garden party,  just like that? Did they forget just <em>HOW</em> the Grand Galloping Gala went? I mean,  Pinkie is being Pinkie and having zero comprehension of certain things and that was totally expected of her and Fluttershy didn't do much but feed birds,  though it's pretty rude to drop bird feed on others. But everyone else should have had more sense in their heads,  especially Twilight.
</li><li>Amazingly enough,  <strong>Rarity got away with it all in the end.</strong> Not at one point did she have to come clean infront of all the important business contacts and her friends,  only she,  Opal and Celestia know what was really going on. Now that's a pretty unusual moment in TV history. If this was any other show,  like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Friends" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Friends">Friends</a>,  Rarity would had been found out near the end and much drama would have ensued,  but fixed before the ending credits.

            There was atleast 10 pages there,  and I just wanted to give out my after thoughts of the episode <em>before</em> other peoples theories are added in.

            Everyone's saying that she got away with it in the end. I think the ungodly amount of stress she was put through was punishment enough. I don't think she'll be doing it again.
<p></p>I chalk the mane cast's antics up to them being in high spirits over Twilight's birthday. Plus,  all the sugar would've been giving them a rush.

            Honestly,  I like that there wasn't a scene where she had to come clean about every single lie she told.  She still learned her lesson from everything that happened,  but without slavishly following the outline of every sitcom episode about lying ever made.

            Exactly.  And at the end of it,  she <em>did</em> tell the truth - that her friends were,  in fact,  her friends.  Given the average attention span and reliability of the Canterlot set,  that ruined her just as much as coming clean about each individual lie would have.  Fancy Pants' intervention is the only thing that saved Rarity's career,  I'm sure.

            Yeah,  I didn't see her getting away with it. And I was also confused why she didn't talk about the very <em>real</em> connections her friends have. I think,  perhaps,  Jet Set and Upper Crust made her think "connections to Ponyville bad for reputation",  and that colored her actions after that.

            Yeah,  I'm <strong>GLAD</strong> they averted her having to come clean about every lie to her <em>friends</em> and she still learned her lesson.
<p></p>I just felt like pointing out how unexpected it was. Because really,  we are a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> bunch here,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerouslyGenreSavvy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerouslyGenreSavvy">Dangerously Genre Savvy</a>,  so most probobly expected her to come clean.
<p></p>Oh,  and Fancy Pants is maybe the only reasonable high class Canterlot Pony,  not all stuck up and judging. <em>That's how classy ponies should act,  like gentlecolts.</em>
<p></p>Oh,  and the rest aren't ponies,  they're sheep. They just follow their desiganted herd leader.
