            I'd like to see the character development jump up a bit,  but I'm good with it being nice and fun. But 44 minutes is 22 more minutes of fun at a time! Also about the movie,  if I were to cosplay at all it would obviously have to be as Dusk Shine.
<p></p>I'd love to see a western spin-off with Braebrun,  or an adventure spinoff with Trixie,  too.
<p></p>And Death... what?

<p></p>he's engeric but also sensible.  Could make a good leading role in a spinoff.

            Ok,  so here's my idea. Braeburn moves to Canterlot to open up a store that sells Appleoosan apples. He ends up rooming with Trixie,  who's been lying around the house ever since Twilight showed her up at Ponyville. Braeburn ends up motivating Trixie to try and be successful again.

<p></p>Nope,  we barely exist,  even on the internet.

She is extremely unlikely to return. Character of the week is character of the week.
<p></p>This being said,  I would like the series to end in a two parter where basically every significant enough character of the week plays a role - think Scrubs' series finale.
<p></p>This being said,  second season has recurring callbacks to the first one - Pinkie Sense,  Princess Luna's return,  Zecora being made into a very important character (was she in more than one ep of S1?),  that the other characters' return might just happen. Not right now though - I believe most of S2 was already finished before it aired.

            I'm of the 'Trixi has an inferiority complex' camp as well,  myself. I like to think that she had a 'friend [spoiler: read,  bully]' who used to show her up or something so she <em>has</em> to prove that she's the best just to feel like she's any good. And possibly that because of her 'competition [spoiler: read,  abuse]' with this 'friend' she's come to think that being able to humiliate = being good,  in the way that a victim of physical bullying could easily come to believe that being able to beat somebody up = being strong.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> I think that's what makes her so popular - it's so heavy in the show that it's effectively canon that she's insecure,  but the vagueness of it makes it really easy to project onto her,  and sympathize with her. I was picked on as a kid so I go for the bullying approach because it's what I understand. People give her their own problems so they have someone they can share them with,  and sympathize with. They <em>want</em> to have someone they can share their problems with... and there's Trixie.
<p></p>In a way I think I almost don't want her to come back - why I don't want any of the one off villains to come back. They all work as templates to project ourselves on to,  because their always sympathetic. The audience wans someone to share their problems with,  and there they are. The mane cast are good to be happy with,  but they don't have problems. the villains are good to be sad with,  because they do.

            The problem is (and I get what you're saying),  is that she'd put up this defensive wall immediately.  How would she react to someone just showing her sudden unexpected kindness?  She's probably used to getting hecklers and nay-sayers.
<p></p>I can easily hear her saying (or crying) "Don't you <em>dare</em> pity me!  I don't need your false sympathy,  get out of my face!"
<p></p>^ Yeah,  even in MLP,  we have bullies.  Who sometimes get away with it.  And then the abused filly grows up and ends up like her.
