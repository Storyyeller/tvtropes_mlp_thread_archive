            The move is obviously just a joke at the moment,  Ginger. It'll probably have a very short range of effect when it's done,  and most definitely won't be a OHKO.

            Yeah,  I don't think this season has handled Pinkie particularly well apart from Baby Cakes. The Discord episodes,  this one,  Super Speedy Cider Squeezy and Luna Eclipsed all showed some of the worst parts of her.
<p></p>And no,  I don't really hate Pinkie.

            Even as a big pinkie fan I have to admitt she went too far with Luna and when she destroyed Crankie's memorie book.
<p></p>The same happened to Rainbow last season we saw the best of her. This seasn we saw more about her bad side.

            At least in Luna Eclipsed her obliviousness to Luna was reasonable,  at least up to the point where Twilight held her down and explained what was going on.   After that,  though,  yeah,  she was being kind of a jerk.

If any other character than Pinkie had invaded Cranky's privacy as much as Pinkie did,  they would have gotten called out a lot sooner.

            While the obliviousness to things like personal space and property were OOC,  I don't think the persistence in making an apology was that bad. I do very much think that Pinkie is incapable of not being Pinkie. Making an apology was her way of setting things straight,  and if there's one thing Pinkie always does,  it's set things straight. She's just so single minded in her actions,  that her own determination to fix things just made them worse.

            @Ginger: Well of course Rainbow Dash would know about why Cranky wouldn't like Pinkie since she herself was in the same situation in Griffon A Brush Off. Yeah I know I'm probably reading in to it to much but that is what I saw.

            @Lurker Ok then. Her insistence that she make an apology was just fucking irritating then.
<p></p>Is that better?

            @Lurker: It wasn't so much that she wanted to apologize; that was understandable.  It's that she basically continued doing the same behavior that she wanted to apologize <em>for</em>.

            It certainly wasn't obvious to her that she was hurting Luna. Luna hid her emotions the whole time outside of when she was alone with Twilight.

That wasn't a problem until Twilight informed her that Luna didn't want to be scary.

            Fighting is Magic is still broken because they're still not even close to finishing any characters. Like Lurker said,  The Stare is obviously a joke at the moment and is meant only as a placeholder. Judging by other fighting games with moves like that,  you'd probably have to be in the line of her eyesight to get hit by it (or rather,  on the ground in front of her.) The Stare just <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/TVWnY.png">KO'd Pinkie in one hit<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small>. And it's literally just her glaring. <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/wXqNO.png">As seen here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small>. <br> <br>And I know the conversation changed when I was typing and screencapping those,  so... <br>While I agree that it is terrible that Pinkie burned his journal,  it was an accident,  she didn't mean to do it. She absolutely should have been more careful though and I think that was moreso the problem than her mistake in the first place; she just wasn't caring enough. I guess this is the general consensus? I don't know,  and I don't feel like jumping in here other than that.

            How on earth can you people just STOP caring about characters when they shift out of focus. Again,  maybe this is just something weird that applies to me and me alone,  but I'm capable of loving characters even when they AREN'T the stars

            @Edvedd I agree with you
<p></p>I think for her it's an double edged sword  she doesnt' get called. But at the same time ponies know that they can't rely on her.
<p></p>Still I believe that there isn't anything wrong with her having her flaws. The problem is that she needs to hava a bit more consequences for them I think.
<p></p>Even then I feel like she is growing as a character just like Applejack that couldn't admitt she needed help nor spoke to Rarity.

            Ginger,  you're in a fandom where every character that gets even a second of screentime gets a name and personality. I don't think you have to worry about that.
