            @Ace: Oh,  I believe you. I was being serious - The ability to Douse runs in my family(And despite popular belief,  dowsing is <em>not</em> something anyone can do. Not only is it an inherent and hereditary 'knack',  you also need certain materials for certain things,  etc.). I'm convinced that certain skills that have been historically referred to as 'magic' do exist,  but are really only the result of some form of energy we have yet to learn how to measure.
<p></p>That's a pretty neat 'skill' you have,  too. My Dad knows a guy who can't wear watches because his body drains the battery in a matter of days - he got it after being struck by lighting. <em>Twice</em>.

            @Sera: Yeah,  I know about him. Need to go get the books from his series and read up about him since I've already read some fanfics featuring him and the ponies crossed over.
<p></p>I wasn't kidding about the electricity either,  there was this electrical meter in the Jurong Science Center that could measure your bioelectrical potential if you put your hands on the electrodes. My parents could only pump the needle about a quarter of the gauge,  when I put my hands there the needle shot up to about halfway,  and when I concentrated,  the electrical activity from my nervous system drove the needle to about three-quarters! Thankfully I'm not lethal to electronics,  although the metal hooks in my workplace's store shelves tend to build an opposite charge to me so I get "stung" when I touch them <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            @Sera: Read the one where Pinkie pops up in Harry Dresden's apartment with a cry of "Foreeeeever!" when he was talking about promises,  then throws a party for everyone he knows? I know it's linked on EQ Daily somewhere.
<p></p>@Star Swirl: Mostly it's about the computers,  and the sheer linear computing power they have for their size these days is frankly fearsome. A 2012 desktop with a midrange processor and a few gigabytes of RAM could easily out-compute a state-of-the-art 80's Cray super-computer. Even our smartphones are miniaturized computers powerful enough to do more than take phone calls (like post on this forum <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">)! Then there's talk about making intelligent powerlines that can efficiently control power consumption to prevent electricity from being wasted,  smart materials that make legendary Mithril armor look clunky,  and even smart screens thin enough to integrate into our clothes. It's amazing what we can cook up without magic as it is.

            I took my corgi to herd some sheep once,  he's definitely NOT good at it.  He just ran around and barked and made a mess of things!  It was at some farm ... you paid 20 bucks to see if your dog had any good herding instincts.  They had classes for herding dogs so you could train them better if you wanted.  I just wanted to see what he'd do in a pen full of sheep...
<p></p>The lady at the farm freaked out cuz one of the sheep bumped into me and stepped on my foot,  I told her "Lady Ive been stepped on and bitten by horses... a sheep isnt going to do much damage"  Ahh memories,  he was just a puppy back then...
