            So...Treehouse aired a 3-hour MLP marathon just now,  with the last two in the marathon being the premiere of the two-parter Wedding episode (even though they still have to air the rest of the second half of Season 2). I guess it was because of Thanksgiving coming around the corner in my country,  and there were already commercials for the playset revolving around the episode,  so I guess it was a wake-up call for them to hurry up. I found it underwhelming and uninspiring to say the least. Let the flame wars begin. By that I mean let's just take it as is and not question it.

            The finale was definitely good,  but I don't know if I'd go so far as to say that it was the best of the series.  I personally think the Discord episodes did more with the characterization.  It's still epic tier though,  if only because they utterly blindsided the fandom with the changelings.

            I loved the season-two finale at first,  but when I watched it a second time I didn't like it as much. I don't know why,  I just didn't find it to be quite as awesome as it was the first time watching it. And I still find Shinning Armor to be flat and boring {It really says something about my thoughts on him when I like him way more in Madmax's comics and the hilarious "Ask Female Shinning Armor" tumblr then I do in the actual show},  which hopefully season 3 will fix. I would have fogiven the huge <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">Remember the new guy</a> problem if he was at least intreasting,  but {While we're on that topic,  I don't like the first song in the finale either}......
<p></p>Though I still think that Chrysalis is the best antagonist in the series so far,  the changlings were pretty cool {As was the fight scene},  and Candence was pretty neat at least. I also liked both the songs in the second part of the finale. It's not bad or anything,  I just don't like the season 2 finale quite as much as nearly everyone else does.
<p></p>And regarding Taken 2: It might not be as good as the first film,  but I'll still check it out because of how much I loved the first movie. We shall see if I like it or not.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

I guess that was what totally ruined the fight scene for me,  mainly because of how it seemed generic,  like protagonists fighting duplicates of themselves.

            Everything has been done before,  and nothing is truly original. All that matters is that you put your own unique spin on a concept while you draw from the source.

            The season two finale did blow my mind the first time I watched it.  I've calmed down now,  but it's still right up there with the very best of the show.  Changlings I did not see coming,  and I really enjoyed the musical scores.

            @X: <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeling#Changelings_in_popular_culture">Because it's not like changelings are a standby of folklore that have been used in everything from Star Wars to Shakespeare.  Oh wait...<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<p></p>But seriously,  just because a similar idea has been used before hardly makes it unoriginal.  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools">Tropes Are Tools</a> after all,  and it's pretty much impossible to create <em>anything</em> that isn't inspired by something else.  It's execution that matters,  and I think the finale did a pretty good job with it.  Using an existing idea well is far better than coming up with something original and handling it really badly.
<p></p>@Mousa: Well,  she is the element of generosity after all.  That and my headcanon is that ponies have Pegasi insurance to cover stuff like that.  I mean,  when a third of the population can fly,  it's inevitable that somepony is going to drop something on a house.
