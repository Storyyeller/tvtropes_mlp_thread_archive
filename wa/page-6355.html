            @Turtle: It's not like it comes up day-to-day. It's basically just a party trick I can do,  unless I wanted to gather the materials to find something more complicated,  but even then I wouldn't know exactly <em>how</em> to do it.
<p></p>...Still,  it is admittedly kind of neat to know I can do something like that.

            @Story: Well,  I actually have - though in a non-rigorous sense. See,  Dowsing applies to <em>any</em> object your trying to find,  though can only find certain objects. The easiest one to find(because of the convenience of the materials) is known as 'witching the baby' - witching being another term for dowsing. It requires a gold ring(white gold will do as well),  a string,  and a person(In this case,  a woman who has had children). You dangle the ring from the string over the wrist of the woman's dominant hand,  and if you can dowse,  it will begin to sway in a certain patter. How it sways depends on the gender of the baby the woman has had - back and forth for a boy,  and in a circle for a girl.
<p></p>I've done this on two women - my mother and a teacher. Both women had children of genders I was unaware of(It counts babies that were stillbirths or miscarriages; my mother miscarried twins between my older brother and I). For my mother it swung four times - three boys,  and one girl. First a boy(my brother),  then another boy(twin 1) then a girl(twin 2) then a third boy(myself). For my teacher it swung twice - A boy,  then a girl. I had assumed my teacher had <em>two</em> boys,  proving that it's accurate even when I myself am misinformed.
<p></p>Obviously for it to be called scientific I'd have to test it more rigorously - several women whom I've never met before,  some of whom have never been pregnant,  etc.) Alternatively it also works if you hold it over someone's head - in this case it works for men and women,  but will only tell their gender(I've always wondered how it would react to a transsexual or a hermaphrodite) - or over a pregnant woman's belly - in which case it tells the gender of the child,  and presumably the number. So obviously there <em>are</em> scientific ways to test it,  and with other materials as well,  should I be curious enough to look them up. It's also been demonstrated that the knack isn't available to everyone; I can dowse better than my borther,  for example(My string will sway more violently than his), and my mother can't do it at all.
