            <span class="blue">@Japanese Teeth: first of all,  on the subject of Hurricane Fluttershy: it wasn't bad by any means,  in fact it is probably my favorite Rainbow Dash focused episode,  and she's my favorite character!  It just seemed a very sudden progression to the end.  I felt like I was finally getting invested in the plot,  then suddenly,  it was over.  I might have just been really sleepy that day or something.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Now as for your Persona question,  Persona 3 and 4 are essentially a different series than the</span> <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">first 3 games.</a>  <span class="blue">They're sort of a reboot,  and more or less in a different canon.  Persona 3 is great,  nearly as good as Persona 4 in every way,  but the original version of it had some seriously glaring issues that detract from the experience.  If you can,  get a hold of the PSP version,  which fixed every major issue with the game and added a ton of new content,  including the choice between a Male or Female main character.  Overall,  I liked number 4 better,  but the PSP version of Persona 3 is technically as good as it,  so it'll likely come down to personal preference.  Persona 3 is much darker,  and has the main cast as a group of comrades focused on their mission.  Persona 4 is more lighthearted and much more focuses on the team as a group of FRIENDS,  with their friendship being the center of the game.</span>

            Most people agree Luna Eclipsed had some bigg issues,  morale came in sloppily out of no where,  issues with how some ponies were acting (justified or no) etc... It's just most people just ignore those little things becuase of the <strong>AWESOME MAJESTY THAT IS THE <em>PRINCESS OF THE NIGHT</em></strong>

<p></p>@Seraphem: I feel the same way about Luna Eclipsed.  It's a great episode with one or two nasty flaws that set it back a bit. Namely the issue with the moral.

<p></p><span class="blue">@Stevebat:Pretty much.  Although the third game also relies on The Power of Friendship to power your persona,  which comes off as kind of inconsistent with the rest of the game's tone,  which is one of the reasons I liked the 4th game better.  Oh,  also the bosses in the 3rd game are boring,  and really cool/unique in the 4th game.</span>

It's like "Oh wait,  they want to be scared!  Everything is fine now."  She never really does anything differently; she just starts being scary on purpose rather than by accident.  You'd think that would be counterproductive.

<p></p><span class="blue">That's the one I played first.  It's good,  just let down by a lot of issues that they fixed in P4.  You can't control your party members in battle,  only give them specialized A.I. orders.  Their A.I. works remarkably well... but not nearly as good as if you controlled them yourself.  There are also a lot of little issues they fixed that don't matter much,  but felt like a godsend when they fixed them: the menu screen took forever to load in dungeons,  there is a really,  really long thing that happens every single time you gain a social link rank,  persona fusing is improved,  social stats were a lot harder to raise,  etc.  It's still worth playing though.  OH,  the one advantage FES has over the PSP version: all of the animated sequences were cut out of the PSP due to hardware limitations.</span>

            I really didn't see the problem with LE either. People <em>do</em> have fun getting scared. It's the reason horror movies and haunted houses exist. The conflict only existed because of the misunderstanding of that. With that figured out,  nopony really needed to act differently.

            I really really liked Fluttershy's character in Green Isn't Your Color. The problem was Twilight really shouldn't be in this episode.

<p></p>The issue isn't the moral itself it's how the story really has nothing to so with it. Though I do see how it worked out. And overall <em><strong>WE COMPLETELY ENDORSE THIS WITH THE FULL ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE</strong></em>
<p></p>Luna was frustrated that all the ponies were scared of her,  but the ones that seemed the MOST scared weren't really,  they were just playing,  AND DID NOT KNOW SHE WAS UPSET,  that can't be emphasized enough,  Pinkie though Luna was acting scary on purpose and she was playing along,  she never saw anything to the contrary. The other ponies saw that Luna wasn't really mean or anythgin worth being scared over. Yeah it's a stretch,  but LUNA WAS AMAZING!!!!
