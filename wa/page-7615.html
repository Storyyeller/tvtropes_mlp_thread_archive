<p></p>The stuff that's going on will become clearer over time. Especially when Twilight and Tick Tock put their heads together and we get insight from the villians.
<p></p>And yeah,  Shadowstep relly impressed me there. He's actually scarily competent. Not to mention his attitude to his "work" and "play".
<p></p>But you're still fairly early in. There's some more major characters that need to be introduced.

            well,  RD was LOUSY at it,  she never actually did much of anything with her ministry. Really the only ones that were actually GOOD at running there ministry were Rarity and Twilight. plus AJ after awhile,  but she had issues at first. A that point the Ministries were a combination long-shot,  publicity stunt,  morale boost. it was only once they begin to actaully exert authority that things started sliding downhill.

I'm still a bit skeptical of Watcher's description of how the six ponies got put at the heads of the ministries,  because I really can't imagine RD,  Fluttershy,  or Pinkie in that capacity,  but I'll wait until I get more backstory before complaining about it. </div>
<p></p>As Seraphem said,  they weren't that effective,  which was one of the problems. They were begged to do it simply because of who they were rather than because they were qualified.

            eh not that bad,  she took it in stride. The creators knwo there are people like that everywhere,  all focusing on the very few plot-holes does is make them stronger and drown out the good. BEST THING TO DO IS JUST IGNORE THEM COMPLETLY. tHEY ALL KNOW THEY ARE A very SMALL MINORITY AND THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF FANS ARE NOT LIKE THAT.

            So why exactly were the Mane Six so well known in the FO:E universe? Or did their heroic deeds actually allow them to reach celebrity status unlike the show.

            @ Apple,  if you mean the sibsy trolling,  don't all reacting at all does is validate the troll,  just ignore it,  Sibsy took it well,  she and all the creators know that is NOT the fandom as a whole but a very few plot-holes,  the type that exist EVERYWHERE. So just ignore it and wait for the parasprites to die of starvation after we cut off there diet of attention and shock.

            Yeah,  the fact that none of them could control their ministries was the real issue. Some like Pinkie were <em>really</em> good at doing the job for which their ministry was intended for,  but that makes sense considering who Pinkie is,  the situation and what her ministry was for.

            well Rarity had no issues with controlling her ministry,  her's was the one that ran the smoothest,  it's just WHAT her ministry did that was the issue.

            yup,  to sum it up the ministries were a great idea on paper that failed horrendesly becuase of two things nopony thought about beforehoof but should have been blindingly obvious.
<p></p>1. It split the group up,  when they were far stronger as a whole.
<p></p>2. none of the Mane 6 were really qualified to do that sort of work.
