            @Moe: French people still say "Sacre bleu",  despite the rule that led to that phrase being coined being repealed centuries back. Just because a few old phrases hint that she was worshipped <em>once</em>,  that doesn't mean she's worshipped <em>now</em>.

            My thoughts on Celestia,  Luna,  and any other potential 'gods' of the setting is that - due to the fact that being able to remember <em>anything</em> at their age would require absurd amounts of mental processing power - they're astronomically intelligent being,  capable of <em>seeming</em> omniscient to the lay pony. they are,  however,  still completely fallable. As such some ponies may treat them like gods,  and some may fall heavier into the roll than others,  while others may simply sit back and only step in where needed.
<p></p>While it's all rather absurd fanon TCYB required me to do a lot of thinking about the nature of the gods,  so I have a lot of 'ideas' about them and how they operate. Like they have basically their own society and legal system exclusively for gods so they don't step out of line with their powers,  for example.

            @Apple: Maybe the cultural counterparts are less a country,  more a regional thing? Like EP's are western,  Pegasi are central and mediterranean,  and unicorns are eastern?

            I got to wonder...what sort of miltary has Equestria got?  OK,  there's the Palace Guard,  but they seem limited to Canterlot.  A bit like the Patorian Guard of ancient Rome...or the Guard Regiments of the British Army.  There's the Wonderbolts...but they seem to be just the airforce.
<p></p>Think Equestria has an intelligence agency?  A national police force?  An actual army/navy?

            I like the idea of Equestria being one country in MLP-world,  and different creatures having control of each country. The leaders of each country could meet on a regular basis,  or even be the original Elements of Harmony. OK,  I know how it says that Celestia alone used the Elements to seal Luna,  but that might just be historical liberty. For all we know,  each country has a version of the story where their leader saves the world from Nightmare Moon.

            Because maybe you could go back to sleep and see if you can have the dream again?
<p></p>And,  for the record,  I think it was Drenius who woke you up.

            @Applelight  I like to think that Equestia have more regular army,  even if nothing in show confirm that,  but also proof against that.  And we know that ponies are familiar with war (at least they concept,  unlike fanfics like Project Horizons suggested), 
<p></p>In my headcanon it's mildly military,  and is made of all pony races.  Also they have intelligence. But that's mixed with my pony SPC foundation headcanon.

            @Super Gex: In The Colour You Bleed,  the setup was basically just that. Equestria was but one country of many - though admittedly the largest and most influential. Different countries had distinct cultures,  political and social views,  and each country even has it's own patron deity in the vein of Luna and Celestia. The story mostly takes part in Aloa,  Equestria's none-to-friendly neighbor.

            Alright,  kegisak,  I'll read your fic for as long as my squirrel-level attention span will allow.
<p></p>Also,  I believe that modern (by our standards) technology exists in the world,  but Ponyvillians just prefer to live simpler lives,  like semi-Amish.
