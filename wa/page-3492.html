            Interestingly,  the post times in my archived copy of the first page are 3 hours earlier then the current version of that page. I wonder what caused it. I guess maybe the server changed timezones or something. At the very least,  this will complicate my plans of making a graph of posting times.

            Hey,  everyone in a different timezone,  what times do you see on these posts?
<p></p>My theory is that it used Pacific time in the past but now uses your own timezone.

Yeah,  sending out invitations to person + guest isn't uncommon. She probably just assumed Twilight would bring Spike along,  seeing as how he's known her the longest. Depending on when the chronology is,  Celestia might have assumed that Twilight hadn't gotten to know any of the Ponyville ponies well enough to feel comfortable inviting them.

            As far as Celestia solving Discord's riddle,  Celestia <em>wasn't there</em> when Twilight used the book in the library to find out about the elements,  so she wouldn't know where they were either. I bet she was doing some searching of her own,  anyway,  then moved on to Plan B with the letters when it became clear that they had lost round 1 against Discord.

            @Lurker but the letters would only work if the mane cast were Discorded and Discord had figured he'd won. That implies that she let them go off to the maze knowing full well what would happen.

            <div class="quoteblock">Yes,  well,  sometimes it's important. What are you supposed to do in it's place? Break down and tell the absolute truth? Even when you don't know how they'll react,  and the result could be... less than pleasant? Sometimes you can't just tell someone it isn't any of their business,  because as far as they're concerned it is their business. Sometimes you either have to lie or be a rules lawyer. If you don't like lying,  then it isn't a choice at all.</div>
I can be a stubborn ass about keeping my mouth shut when I don't want to say something. Sometimes,  this is kind of a bad thing.
<p></p>Not presuming to speak for anyone other than myself,  but being deceptive or misleading weighs more on my conscience than simply withholding information,  though.

            Like I said,  Ginger,  the letters could have easily been Plan B. Just because a character is <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a>,  doesn't mean that their first plan <em>always</em> works. It just means they have backups.

            @ginger: Or she just realized "Oh crap,  Discord got them" and then sent the letters as a last resort to keep Twilight from being broken.
<p></p>@Kyler: I'm the same way.  I feel a lot less bad about telling someone that it's none of their business than I do about trying to mislead them,  even if I don't technically lie.

            Ah,  I was wondering when I popped in. I knew it was early.
<p></p>It's nice to know that that attitude persists to this day.
<p></p>@Kyler: Well... sometimes you don't really get the option. It's in my nature to be honest,  and I abhor lying... sometimes you just find yourself in a situation that you can't back out of,  and there are just some people you can't tell to step off. And those are exactly the kinds of people you don't always want to be honest with... so I figured out a few tricks to mislead without lying,  and rationalized it. I can't control how they'll take it. It isn't my fault they were wrong. I never lied to them. It's... as far as I'm concerned,  it's easier. I have a rather startling knack for controlling people like that.

You guys know me,  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad"> I'm a massive fan of long running gambits and plans and manipulations. For me,  it's easier to believe that Celestia had this all planned from the beginning,  and what she always planned to do if the elements did end up stolen. I figured a lot of her anger in discord's introduction came from her knowing what she would have to put her subjects through now that Discord has stolen the elements

            I have no doubt that Celestia is capable of Speedchess,  but I also think her initial plan would be a bit more complex than what you guys seem to think it would be.
<p></p>She had to find a way of having her subjects use the elements without Discord stopping them. The only way to do that? Put him in a position where he thinks he's won. and where he thinks the elements have been rendered useless. Simple.
