            @Drenius:  Agreed so much.  I can't think of any CG monster that has ever scared me,  they never look real and they insist on shoving them into the spotlight when skulking through shadows would be scarier.
<p></p>@Ginger:  Oh man,  fingernail stuff is the worst.  I always squirm so much whenever they start falling out or whatever.

            @ginger My mother's had a recurring nightmare where her teeth suddenly start falling out and she tries to go to the dentist's office to get them back in but it's closed for some reason.
<p></p>She hasn't had it in a while,  nor has it been referenced in anyone else in my family for a while,  but teeth falling out made me think of it.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            Dreams involving weird stuff happening with teeth,  like them rotting or falling out are pretty common.  Supposedly they indicate fears about getting older,  but I'm not sure how accurate that is.
