            I have a feeling that Babs might show up again.
<p></p>Okay,  now that the episode is over,  here are my thoughts:
<p></p>It was simply painfully unsubtle in its messages and the dialogues are intolerably trite. The only few things I found remotely interesting in this episode was (well,  in my opinion at any rate) the song and occasional Pinkie antics.
<p></p>All in all,  it was just banal and all around awful. I hope the next episode is better; I didn't like the previous episode either.

            okay first impressions before heading to work.
<p></p>Lot of really good comedy and jokes in the first half,  cycle of abuse,  very realistic,  and it did give a lot of important information,  the whole cycle thing,  don't be afraid to tell an adult.
<p></p>Though to often IRL telling doesn't do much unfourtinitly,  but still it's better then staying silent. It didn't vop out with ALL bullies are just in need of freinds,  since DT and SS aren't that type,  so it was just showing ONE cuase of bullying,  also how bullying creates more bullies
<p></p>The song,  was wierd,  but fun. First song to be so...artistic,  the odd backgrounds,  the..it just felt odd to watch,  but fun to listen to
<p></p>And well,  overall,  pretty damn good,  there is way way way to much to the whole bullying issue to deal with in one episode,  but they did pretty well on the part of it they focused on.

            I'm sorry,  but after stealing away the clubhouse and making Sweetie Belle cry,  I have absolutely zero sympathy for Babs. If she was bullied so much,  she'd realize how horrible it would be to bully others. But no,  she kept going and made things even worse to the point that anything the writers would've tried to give her sympathy would have made me cold to whatever suffering she had coming to her. Sorry Babs,  you don't deserve the right to have a happy ending.

            It might be because of the skipping durings parts of the episode,  but it didn't really seem that memorable to me. The song and animation were fun though,  really reminded me of that idealistic depiction of ice-cream parlors in the 50's. Or just the Back to the Future representation of it >.>
<p></p>Emergency edible boots though still intrigues me. What would Rarity even be doing that would require those.

<p></p>It's funny; I really like Pinkie when she appears to dish out some minor,  sight gags. However,  so far I disliked all the episodes that primarily focused on her.

            @Ed: it's for her Rarity's Secret catalogue,  which is canon as of the iOS spoof ad by the Hub. It also mentions <em>bridles</em>,  although I think she considers having bridles with bits too racy even for her catalogue.

            Eh,  I don't think someone becomes irredeemable just because they were a dick for a few days.  Doesn't change the fact that they're a dick,  but it's not like DT or SS where it's a prolonged case with no reason.
<p></p>She caved to pressure out of a desire to not be on the receiving end any more,  but more importantly <em>realized she was being cruel and decided to stop</em>.  She did something nasty,  realized she did something nasty,  and then decided not to do it anymore.

            Also,  I see they went the route of 'Talk to someone about it' route as well... but it's interesting that they actually gave a good <em>reason</em> for the girl's reluctance to do so. A bit of 'lesson for the parents' there as well.
<p></p>Definitely a good episode. Good song,  pretty good worldbuilding in Babs(Until stated otherwise I shall continue to believe that she's the Oranges daughter),  and a pretty good moral - plus,  the inclusaion on DT and SS,  who <em>don't</em> have a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> handy,  kinda of shows that it <em>can</em> be more complex than that. Some might claim that it sort of undermines the lesson,  but I don't think so,  myself.
<p></p>Also,  Babs mentioned her older sister... do you think she actually has a big sister back home,  or that she was referring to AJ as a sort of pseudo big-sis? I mean,  AJ <em>did</em> know about her being picked on beforehand,  after all.

            IMO that was the worst of series 3 so far. Not saying it was bad,  just that the others were better. Didn't like the song much,  but the visuals of it,  those I liked.

            @ D yeah pretty much EVERY episode has been pretty clear in what the message was,  yes this was a bit more obvious then most but as pointed out
<p></p><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">Some Anvils Need to Be Dropped</a>
<p></p>Again the target for the show,  and this episode more then most,  was school kids,  this is something that is a huge HUGE issue for them,  not so much the older fans. And they handled it as well as they possibly could in 22 minutes,  sure they may have gone a bit overboard in making Babs a dick,  but overall they handled it well
