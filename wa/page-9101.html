            <span class="blue">Speaking of fanfics,  I idly clicked on a link someone had provided the other day of Crisis: Equestria's newest chapter.  I had no real intention of reading it but I read the first few pages to see what all the fuss was about.  I decided that the writing was decent (better than I expect from most fanfic) but the writer still made a huge number of amateur mistakes and simple bad writing choices.  It made me think of rewriting a bit of it and pointing out what was wrong for the sake of interested fanfic writers out there.  I'm not sure if this idea makes me arrogant or not,  or whether anyone would actually be interested in it.</span>

            I'd be very interested in that,  actually,  though only to a degree. Which is to say,  to the degree where we have some assurance that you <em>do</em> know what you're talking about in a professional capacity rather than just saying "This is how <em>I</em> think it should have gone"

            Ganon doesn't post in the CEQ thread. One of his editors does,  though. I'd personally like to see what the "bad writing choices" would be. I have a hard time seeing faults like that in things sometimes. Posting in the thread for the fanfic would probably be better than here though. <br> <br><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_down.png" alt="[down]" title="[down]" height="16" width="16">This,  pretty much.

<p></p><span class="blue">Yeah,  I thought some might see it that way.  It's just one of the things I do sometimes when I am critiquing someone's work.  I write a little paragraph pointing out what I think is wrong with it,  and a solution,  and then I often say something like "I'd use something like <em>this</em>" and then rewrite it in my own way.  It's never meant to be anything more than a suggestion.</span>

            I came across this in the Should Fox stop picking up Seth Mcfarlane stuff thread.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I've seen this old story...
<p></p>It's happening all over again: The Dark Age of Comic Books,  in a degree,  translated to animated shows: we had some really good adult comedies like The Simpsons,  South Park,  Beavis And Butthead and Duckman (I don't find Family Guy funny at all,  not even the earlier seasons) that had shock value but also had good stories and pretty smart satire.
<p></p>Now the producers are just greenlighting any show that has shock value Completely Missing the Point and not realizing that people loved the earlier comedies NOT because they seemed "edgy" for the sake of being edgy,  but because they were actually very good written.
<p></p>If history has taught us anything,  the modern adult animated comedies will reach a point where it will just not work anymore...probably it's starting to happen already: more "light-hearted show" like Adventure Time and My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic are the ones caughting more fans and atention: less cynisism and sarcasm,  more sincerity and entusiasm. </div>And it makes me fear very much for what will happen to cartoons as a result of MLP. If there's one thing that's been demonstrated by executives at large,  it's that they don't understand why we like this show so much. Even the Hub,  with what they said about wanting Care Bears to become the next brony-style movement.
