            Cool my brain didn't shut down.
<p></p>If I was to humanize the ponies I'd make them all white only because that's most common type found in popular culture.   But on further reflection,  the fact that the ponies only have their characters and based on what we've seen of their culture they could be any race.  Rarity could be Asian as there are ones who speak with a similar accent - personal experience <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin">.  Twilight could easily be black,  or Pinkie and Fluttershy Indian.  AJ's hard work ethic and concerns for the wellbeing of her family's farm applies to everyone in the world.  The gruff and always-must-win attitude of Rainbow Dash also stretches across the board.
<p></p>I want to add more but concerns with getting enough sleep so I don't puke while training tomorrow is overriding more in depth thinking.  Its funny how we worry about such things?
<p></p>Also please excuse me if this comes across badly.  It takes a while for me to articulate my thoughts.  I blame having a roof beam drop on my head while building an extension to a house. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            Sup guys. I just keep making one comment and leaving don't I? Well,  I read over your thoughts over the new rumor.
<p></p>Then I went to read the WMG thingy: "one of the animators said that the last episode has it "perhaps the most disturbing scene of animation (to me... I'm sure others will adore it) I have ever worked on in my life...",  so the future warning to Twilight is most likely to give warning to the potential disaster that the wedding will cause,  but it's not really fully explained what it was."
<p></p>I thought this was an interesting theory that the next episode will foreshadow the wedding~~ Oh well. What are you guys talking about now?

            @Red: Exactly,  I get the idea that the world is diverse,  but I don't like attributing races (or ethnicity,  more accurately,  as that encompasses cultural things as well) to the ponies unless they actually display some sort of characteristic of that ethnicity.  And because all the mane ponies are voiced by Caucasians (and the lines likely written by caucasians as well),  it's hard for me to think of them anything else.  I.e. I have a hard time thinking of RD as black because there's absolutely nothing about her character reminiscent of an African-American,  or any other African ethnicity,  so it just seems arbitrary to me to assign her that race.  If someone else can attribute them ethnicity like that,  great,  but I find it odd sometimes.

            @ilsemmr  I like that idea.  It'd be cool if they do that this upcoming episode.  But the show's decision to have the episodes have as little continuity as possible doesn't fill me with hope.

<p></p>Season 2 has had a lot more continuity than season 1,  though admittedly,  still nothing explicitly plot relevant.

            Actually,  I'm surprised that they haven't been building up to the finale even a little. The Gala actually got two whole episodes earlier in season one dedicated to preparing for it,  one of which was <em>the very first non-pilot episode</em>. I wouldn't be surprised if they at least make some sort of reference to the wedding in the coming episodes.

<p></p>Alright,  I wish I could stay up and let time pass until night turns to day - maybe tomorrow,  but for now good day and night to all you good gentle people.  Pleasant dreams and a good night.
