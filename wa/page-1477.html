<p></p>Wow.  Getting up at seven on a Saturday morning sucks.  It airs at ten here,  which actually works out better for me than the old time slot.  I'm just a little annoyed at having to wait an extra hour for my pony fix. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

I have to get up then for class anyways,  so it doesn't bother me. In fact,  I've been thinking of getting up earlier so I can catch it on one of the streams. It's that or wait 9 hours to be able to watch it when I get home. But then again,  if I wait I can download it and watch it on my TV. Tough decision,  that.

<p></p>Aw,  I <em>like</em> "Cutie Mark Chronicles, " especially Twilight's story.  If I had to choose my least favorite episode,  it'd be "Over A Barrel."  It gave us the "Fluttershy is a tree" meme,  and Showgirl Pinkie,  but overall I think the episode is just mediocre.

            I just started watching this today after reading these forums got me feeling a little pony-curious. Something struck me as kind of dark: the ponies clearly organize themselves into various castes,  distinguished by their features.
<p></p>For example,  the "normal" ponys both have peasant labor sort of jobs - Sweetapple is a farmer and does mostly manual labor,  and Pinkie Pie helps run a bakery - not exactly glamorous careers,  but somebody has to do them. The "unicorn" varieties seem a bit more upper crust - Rarity runs a boutique and decorating service and has access to expensive jewels and valuable silk clothing,  and Twilight is a wizard/aclhemist and trusted member of the queen's court. They are nobility,  in other words. "Pegasus" types like the one with the rainbow whose name I can't remember also seem to be something like the "warrior" caste,  though Fluttershy kind of breaks that mold a bit as she acts more like an ecologist (so maybe its the "Warrior Poet" caste,  with Fluttershy being more of a poet than a typical warrior). "Royal" types are either combinations of pegasus and unicorn or unicorn - I have yet to see a "wealthy" pony that lacked either wings or a horn. This ranking system doesn't seem to apply to other species,  who are at best slaves and at worst treated as pets or rampaging monsters.
<p></p>And now I have analyzed the socioeconomic conditions of a planet populated by sapient ponies.

In fact,  it's my favourite episode overall and has yet to be dethroned (although Lesson Zero and Luna Eclipsed were strong contenders and Winter Wrap Up was queen of the hill until Cutie Mark Chronicles caused me to reluctantly dethrone it).  Twilight's "YESYESYESYESYESYES" streak is my favourite moment in the whole series.  She is the very essence of Adorkable at that moment and that scene always makes me want to wrap her up in a great big hug.

Also,  welcome to the herd.
<p></p>For earth ponies alone: Hoity Toity is an earth pony and runs an extremely high-profile clothes shop in Canterlot. There are a lot of more "upper crust" or at least social-climbing earth ponies in Manehattan. Yes,  the two mane cast earth ponies are of good honest farmin' stock,  but the demographics are skewed somewhat by Ponyville being a comparatively small farming town,  especially when compared to Canterlot or Manehattan; the higher class earth ponies simply don't live there.

            Actually now that I think about it: during the Gala episode we see a lot of upper crust earth ponies and unicorns,  but aside from the wonderbolts,  how many pegasi did we see?
<p></p>Basically though,  each of the races has sort of 'generic' jobs,  but a lot of ponies end up doing other stuff. Like,  Dash is on the weather patrol despite having little interest in weather; her passion lies in flying. Likewise,  Pinkie works at a bakery but her actual passion is for party planning. Farming can be seen as fallback for Earth ponies because of their connection to the land,  and weather working for Pegasi because they're the only ones who can. Unicorns don't really <em>have</em> a fallback,  though,  since their big benefit is dexterity.
<p></p>But yeah,  it's not as rigidly divided as it seems. Fluttershy is perhaps the best example of the true nature. Ponies wind up doing what they want to do,  regardless of creed. Rarity's boutique is possible due to dexterity but other creeds have similar jobs. Twilight is a scientist because of her interest; presumably other races could be just as studious. And so on,  and so forth.
