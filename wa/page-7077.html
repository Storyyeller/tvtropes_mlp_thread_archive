            @Blue Compound Bows have a lot more force behind them than bullets,  and when you combine that with technological upgrades from SHIELD and various utility arrows,  it actually makes sense.

            When watching the trailer,  my main reaction is,  who the heck is the guy with the Bow and why didn't he get a movie. Though to be fair,  Black Widow only appeared as a minor character in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronMan2" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronMan2">Iron Man 2</a>.

            @Blue: Yeah,  but he still manages to make it awesome,  because at least it's multipurpose. I mean,  what can a gun do? Shoot stuff. What can a bow and arrow do? If you're creative,  a metric fuck ton of stuff.
<p></p>That's why I like Green Arrow and Hawkeye. They have <em>one</em> trick,  and they use it to insanely broad effect.

<p></p>Actually,  I don't really care. DC has some pretty cool stuff in it. M basic approach to the companies is that Marvel has cooler powers,  but DC uses their powers in cooler ways.

<p></p>The arrows that shake off the last drop of pee for you,  those are real.  You want to be real careful when aiming those ones.

            Black Widow and Hawkeye orginally started out as villians in the comics many years ago but eventualy became heroes. In most adaptations they usually start out as SHIELD agents,  though I'm pretty sure the Balck Window was an assassin at least once.
<p></p>Fun fact: One of Black Widow's first appearances was Spider-man #86. I know this because I have an issue of Spider-man 85 that used to belong to my uncle when he was a kid and at the end it says "Next Issue: The Black Widow!"
<p></p>Also: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1edrkbZiekg">Does Wolverine's theme in Marvel vs Capcom sound kind of familiar?<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

<p></p>Also hey Pip,  Orion,  Cheerilee.
<p></p>@Orion: About that topic about the weather around here yesterday,  just think of it that our weather is basically Everfree Weather all the time. Yes,  it can be a real pain when the Weather of the day is high-speed thunderstorming. Still,  the nice thing is that our weather is semi-predictable because we learnt how to gauge the way the winds blow and track the pressure changes that result.

<p></p>Considering only one of us watched the movie and he isn't even sure who the bad guys were suppossed to be,  I don't think you have anything to worry about.
