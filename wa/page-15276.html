            I <em>think</em> so. I mean,  she's a Hasbro creation,  so... But she might be an old studio's property,  so I dunno. Like how they can't use some official names for some reason or another.

            Well,  it seems like they can get away with look-alike cameos that don't mention the name if Twilight's mom is anything to go by. Megan could've just been a random two second background event.

            I think small cameos and name drops are fine,  we had things like Moondancer and Lickity Split being mentioned. Seeing as how Hasbro somehow lost the trademarks to most of the G1 <em>ponies</em>,  non-pony characters not named Spike are even less likely.
<p></p>Random sidenote,  I'd just like to remind folks that <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTales" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTales">My Little Pony Tales</a> is <em>not</em> G2,  its kinda a G1.5. G2 had no cartoon.
<p></p>As for Flash,  he shows signs of being a little <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Adorkable" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Adorkable">adorkable</a> himself,  and I find it curious that Sunset didn't do anything to him prior to the big climax.
<p></p>Ninja'd on the G2 thing. WHATSHISGAAAAAAAAAME!!

<p></p>Clearly EQG is the future of Tales where the Equines finally evolved in to the humans they behaved like.

Maybe she wasn't always that much of an asshole,  or maybe he wasn't always such a nice guy.
<p></p>Either way it's another case of Flash's character being a complete after thought in the movie.

<p></p>It was probably back when she first arived and was very helpless which made him feel needed. When she became more confdent,  he realsied that she was an <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBtch" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBtch">Alpha Btch</a> and left her.

            On the comment of Twi not being in the EQG verse,  I think I remember EQG!Pinkie mentioning something about Twilight having someone who looks just like her,  but who lives in the city offhand,  so I think there is an EQG!Twilight,  she just doesn't go to Canterlot High.

Well,  "that guy who brings his guitar to every party ever" is a bit of a douche archetype. I guess <em>EQG</em> made him like Rainbow Dash and Rarity: has the superficial trappings of a hated character type (jerk jock; fashionista alpha bitch; guitar-playing dudebro),  but is actually an alright person.
<p></p>Seeing as it took a few episodes before Dash and Rarity's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a> really became clear...

            @Mio: My guess is that either like Sereg said,  she was helpless when she first got there and needed his support,  or otherwise she decided that since he appears to be a reasonably popular guy she figured that getting in good with him would be a good way to boost her own position. By the time he realized that she didn't really care about him much,  she was already at the top of the food chain.
<p></p>@Kegisak: I see what you mean about Flash,  but I still think he's flat compared to Sombra for 2 reasons:
<p></p>1. Sombra was a story-relevant character. Even though we didn't see much of him,  his existence was integral to the story,  whereas Flash you could remove and not much would change.
<p></p>2. We were actually informed in the story about Sombra's abilities and personality,  if only indirectly.  We didn't see <em>him</em> much,  but we knew that the events were due to his preparations,  which in turn revealed his personality.  Flash didn't have that; he didn't do anything that another character couldn't have done (finding the photos was more a case of "the new girl doesn't look like she'd do that,  and SS is enough of a bitch to fake it...",  and there are any number of characters who could have connected those dots).  The only thing that really makes him unique is that he's SS's ex,  and the story basically never mentions that again.
<p></p>@Meta: That was actually one thing I appreciated about him.  They took a douchetastic character type (guitar-playing Fonzie wannabe) and made him okay. Only problem is he didn't get developed as much as RD or Rarity and resides firmly in Generic Nice Guy territory.

            @JT: Right. MY point was that Flash and Sombra have the same amount of <em>on-screen</em> development,  ut Sombra had a lot more stock in the story,  so he got... if it were a video game I'd call it environmental storytelling,  but that's not quite right. He got second-hand development due to how important he was to the story. If Flash had had more stock in the story,  he would have gotten more development to.
<p></p>Of course that's not exactly much of a what-if,  because that basically means the same as "What if that actress chick had more development". MY point is just that he wasn't inherently flat,  just kind of an afterthought to the story,  and not as important as his role <em>should</em> have made him.

Honestly,  my biggest gripe about him was how <em>unnecessary</em> he was.

Like if we had gotten more backstory about him and Sunset,  or if Sunset heard that he had asked Twilight to the dance and upped her vendetta against Twi out of anger,  etc.

            not really,  Sombra didn't get much on screen stuff yes,  but it wasn't environmental. Everything we saw was things that he had done. Actions he had taken,  saw just how smart and careful he was. It was all things he did in the past,  even if we don't see him doing it. All we get fro Flash is "He dumped Sunset a few weeks ago."

            Yeah,  in video games that sort of thing is called environmental storytelling. It's a blanket term for hints at the story told through art and mechanics rather than dialogue or exposition. Like,  a level based around all of Sombra's traps would be environmental storytelling in that the level itself tells us about him.
<p></p>I realize it's the wrong term,  I just don't know what the right one would be for animation.

            I'd say it's indirect storytelling as opposed to direct storytelling. Direct would be us seeing him doing the things. Indirectly,  we see the results of the things that he's done offscreen.  Flash is another level behind <em>that</em>,  with even the <em>results</em> of his offscreen actions being implied rather than shown.
