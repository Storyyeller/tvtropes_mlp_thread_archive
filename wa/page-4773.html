            The only TCGs that I can think of that are still going strong today are Magic,  Pokemon,  and Yu-Gi-Oh. Magic was the first,  and thanks to dedicated development has managed to stay fresh for the past 20 years. Pokemon is also developed by Wizards of the Coast,  and aside from the reliance on coin flips,  it's actually a very well designed game,  IMO. Being backed up by one of,  if not the most lucrative franchises of all time certainly doesn't hurt either. Yu-Gi-Oh still baffles me to this day. It panders to young players with it's style,  but the actual gameplay,  rules,  and mechanics are far too convoluted and complicated for its target audience to fully understand (I know I sure as hell didn't when I was 12),  and yet is still incredibly popular.

            @Lurker: See,  the thing that bugs the hell out of me about Magic is that every few sets they just up and ban everything ever made previously,  instantly turning all those hundreds of cards you spent money on into nothing.  I can't see how a game that can't balance itself without starting over every couple of years can possibly be well designed.

            @Blue You couldn't be more wrong. Magic has many different tournament legal formats. The one you are thinking of is Standard,  which uses the two most recent blocks as well as the most recent Core Set. It rotates with the creation of new sets in order to provide an easy starting point for new players as well as keeping the metagame fresh and changing. You then have Extended,  which is similar to Standard in that sets rotate out over time,  but the cutoff is much farther back,  meaning the card pool is much wider. After that is Legacy,  which has nearly the every card ever printed legal,  only banning cards that are legitimately broken or overpowered. And even further you have Vintage,  which doesn't ban nearly any cards,  and instead merely restricts them to one per deck. All of these formats see extensive official tournament play,  and have various pros and cons.

            Well some cards are just overpowered,  like Black Lotus. And some cause issues in a tournament,  like Scherezade and Chaos Orb.

            @Blue Because that puts long time players with far more disposable income and access to the older,  out of print cards at a near insurmountable advantage to any newer players,  making the game inaccessible. It's essentially <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockout" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockout">Continuity Lockout</a>,  but with cards instead of knowledge.  By having a format where only the newer cards are legal,  you have a more even playing field for people who haven't been playing as long,  as well as a constantly shifting metagame for the more serious tournament players. And nothing is stopping anyone from playing in Legacy or Vintage tournaments,  either,  so it's a win-win.

            Well in the case of Scheherazade and Chaos Orb,  they rely on somewhat external factors,  such as table space and time,  which is at a premium in tournaments. In casual play,  you're only limited by how angry your friends will be.

            They own Wizards of the Coast,  so they certainly have the resources and expertise to do it. There really isn't enough material for one though,  and the framing device would most likely end up being really flimsy.
