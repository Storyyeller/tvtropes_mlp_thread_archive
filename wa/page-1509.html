            I'll admit I tend to shy away from the BIG fanons (Ie. stuff like "Fluttershy's parents are rich solcialites who disowned her for being a weak flyer),  but I still really like the smaller,  universally accepted ones (like Dinky,  and now Sparkler,  being Ditzy's children). Partly because I think they're so pervasive that they pretty much stand in as unofficial canon,  and partly because I think it's really kind of sweet how willing people are to adapt new canon to the fanon - case in point,  them immediately accepting Sparkler into the Doo Family.
<p></p>Even then though,  most of the big fanons are,  of course,  all in good fun. And it's not as if I don't have my own,  being a fanfic writer. It's just something you have to laugh along with,  and take with a grain of salt.

            I honestly don't get it. There's not a single fic that I've enjoyed more than an actual episode.
<p></p>Why? Because the fics NEVER capture exactly WHY I watch this show
<p></p><em>My Little Dashie</em> was an experiment,  one I WON'T be repeating any time shortly. (my heart can't take it I've been depressed all day)

            I don't have the issue with Fluttershy being rich - it's just that a while ago there was someone who said he thought her parents were ashamed of her because of how she chose to live,  and because she was a weak flyer. <em>that's</em> the part I took issue with.
<p></p>As or <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFiction" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFiction">Fan Fiction</a>: I don't tend to read a lot of it,  but I have a few I follow. I also write a fair bit of it. The thing is,  I don't go in to it expecting it to be like the show,  I go in to it for it as it's own piece of work,  that just happens to be set in a universe I enjoy. That' why I prefer OC fics - they can have any kind of feeling they like,  and a lot of them expand a universe I already enjoy.

            If there's <em>any</em> evidence towards Fluttershy being well off,  it's the fact that she lives in an <em>enormous</em> cottage,  well away from the rest of the town,  on er own,  <em>with no means of income</em>. She might occasionally pet-sit,  or do other similar tasks,  but do you really think she could afford that kind of house,  especially with all the animals she takes care of an no doubt has to feed,  on pet-sitting and washing.
<p></p>The other option is that she's a veterinarian,  which would afford a higher income,  but even then it would still make her wealthy on her own,  rather than through inheritance.
<p></p>At either rate,  there is some evidence bu it's fairly meager.

            @ kegisak Agreed,  I look at each story on it's own,  they just benefit from being in a pre-set 'verse because it frees the author from having to exposit stuff about the setting that is all ready know through the cannon.and that doesn't quite sound right...dangit this is why I know better then to try writing stuff,  I have good ideas,  I just suck and getting them out right.
<p></p>also,  some good <a class="urllink" href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/11/increase-in-toy-sales-keeping-hub.html">news<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> while Hasbro announced that overall ratings are in the lower end of what they'd hoped (but still within the boundary of what they projected,  just the very low end) toy and merch sales are through the roof and they are very happy about that.
