            Dragon Quest was embarassingly non-entertaining during the section with the actual dragons in it. Though I did enjoy the interaction between Twilight and Spike during the first part.

            Hi,  guys.  Just wanted to let you all know I'm okay.  I'm still here,  sitting on the sidelines and reading the thread.  I haven't felt much like posting after what happened,  and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't still upset.   My mindset <em>is</em> improving though,  slowly.  Thank you for your kind words and support.  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SincerityMode" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SincerityMode">They meant a lot to me.</a> <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">

            <div class="quoteblock">I say "Well I didn't like it" or "I for one hated it" Allowing for the fact that other people might disagree with me </div>
<p></p>What I meant is,  it seems like "stating your opinion as fact" seems like its only ever a bad thing when its an unpopular/disagreed with opinion.
<p></p>Like for example,  another guy near my posts said "DQ and SOME are high tier."  But you're not telling him to stop that.  (Neither am I—I'm just pointing out how inconsistent certain moral values are)
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">@Moe Dantes: So what exactly about those four episodes you mentioned in the last page were so bad.
<p></p>I ask this because quite frankly it feels like your standards are completely arbitrary. </div>
<p></p>Okay,  in order:
<p></p>"A Friend In Deed" I believe I've already reviewed at length.  It was just too generic,  safe,  pat... it seemed like a Strawberry Shortcake episode with little of the edge or energy I associate with FIM.
<p></p>"Putting Your Hoof Down" was kinda cute,  but I couldn't get over the feeling that the ep was trying too hard to sell the situation to us,  and in doing so made it feel contrived,  forced,  artificial.  I mean,  there are ways they could've told a compelling story about Fluttershy getting over herself,  but this just wasn't it.  Points off also for the writers showing us the most lame-brained examples of "assertiveness" pretty much ever.
<p></p>"It's About Time" was kind of entertaining,  but the whole time I couldn't shake the feeling that the whole thing was just a retread of "Lesson Zero, " but not as good.  I also really really REALLY hate how Twilight Sparkle (my fave,  mind) has been flanderized this season,  going from an insecure but reasonably competent bookworm to someone who is so out of touch that she needs to <em>schedule time to make another schedule.</em>
<p></p>And... "Dragon Quest"  Ugh.... Where do I even begin?  How about with that the plot is basically a retread of "Sonic Rainboom" except without any noteworthy subplots or real character dynamic to flesh it out,  the premise is pretty stupid (Spike "on a quest to learn who he really is" is already a dumb plot,  followed by that his self-discovery basically leads to him taking a bunch of dares).  I had no end of problems with the dragons—even ignoring continuity,  there are just so many things wrong with how dragons are portrayed that I would need a whole other post for it—all summed up by that they raid phoenix nests just to smash the eggs (and not to eat it,  which would be far more believable behavior).  Probably the biggest let down is that rather than defeating or humiliating the dragons (which they could've <em>easily</em> done),  Spike and the ponies <em>run away</em>,  and at the end Spike delivers a "be satisfied with who you are" message,  which comes off as pithy and weak considering the preceding events.
<p></p>I guess I won't need to post that review in my blog after all,  except maybe to clarify some of these complaints.

            @Dante's: you mean Dragon Quest was a retread of G1 Spike's episode. Mostly I found the episode could have been tightened in some areas,  and reworked so it flowed better,  but I still enjoyed it.

            I thought <em>Lesson Zero</em> was the worse episode because of the portrayal of Twilight going belongs-in-a-straightjacket-and-a-padded-room insane over a late <em>report</em>,  whereas <em>It's About Time</em> had her take unnecessary precautions for what was at the time an apparent catastrophe still to come.
<p></p>Though I would guess that we're paying attention to different aspects of the same episodes?

<p></p>It's because negativity (like saying that some thing suck) will provoke more negative response that positiveness (like saying that some thing rocks).

<p></p><ul><li> A Friend in Deed: I guess I can understand that,  but i'm personally fine with that (I can never really describe <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a> as having an "edge" of any sort) .Personally I had more problems with the way it was ultimately resolved and how Pinkie essentially didn't change at all.
<p></p></li><li> Putting Your Hoof Down: I can understand that.
<p></p></li><li> It's About Time: I actually completely agree with you. Except for the entertaining part
<p></p></li><li> Dragon Quest: It does say something when your so called "Quest of Self-Discovery" actually ends with you joining a frat. Still,  I and others are always hungry for any kind of mythological/ worldbuilding aspects of the show that we are willing to for give <em>a lot</em>. As for the Dragon behavior,  that was more or less exactly what I expected,  so despite their rather stupid behavior I accepted it.

            Also,  Twi's flanderization actually makes the moments when she DOES act genuinely pleasant all the sweeter (I'm aware that others  might call this inconsistant writing,  but eh)
