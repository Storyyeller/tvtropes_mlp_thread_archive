            @Pykrete In a vacuum,  maybe,  but taking it as the capstone to the entire series thus far makes it rather appropriate and not at all out of nowhere,  IMO.

<p></p>Wow,  that's pretty rough. Kind of makes me wonder if Twi ever had any profs like that. If she did,  I can see that really influencing her perception of Celestia's expectations (if the hard ass prof is really tough to please,  logically speaking,  the princess must be even tougher).

            Okay,  I guess there was a conceptual problem in that it apparently took ponies centuries to find out why Starswirl's cryptic yet vaguely threatening incantation was causing bad things to happen and the solution was to just Wite-Out it over and write something more sugary instead.
<p></p>But the pacing was kind of a bigger one.

<p></p>She didn't replace the spell,  she completed it. there was no witeing out. it farked everything up because it was a half complete spell,  Twi just fixed that part of it.

            @Sereg: Wow,  good lord. Hell,  Canada only <em>technically</em> has two languages - good luck finding someone outside of Quebec or Nova Scotia who actually speaks french. Does South Africa at least a have a decent language education system? Aside from the insanity of course. Because Canada's is worthless... we have mandatory french classes for eight years,  and most people will come out of school not speaking a word of it aside from motherfucking pronouns.

            Keg: The French immersion at my high school (in Saskatchewan) was actually pretty decent. I had two friends who seemed pretty fluent in French. Although one hasn't used it a whole lot since high school ended years ago,  so I don't know how much he remembers. The other moved away,  but as far as I know,  she still uses it semi-regularly.
<p></p>I'm one of those who pretty much abandoned it after grade eight,  though. I remember a very small smattering of words,  but that's about it. The one phrase I do make sure to remember is "Je ne parle pas Francais". <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>As for the episode,  I thought the pacing on the first section was pretty good,  but the ending was fairly rushed. On a semi-related note: A True,  True Friend is a very addictive song. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">
<p></p>EDIT: Dark: I ran into the same issue with Mandarin as you did with German. I learned a fair bit,  but it was pretty intense. I could almost hold a really stilted,  worse-than-kindergarten level conversation toward the end,  but at that point I couldn't even keep up with the material. Since then I've forgotten about 90% of it.

            Lol,  languages. The only thing I'm worse at than foreign languages is math.  I used to know a bit of Spanish,  but I haven't taken any classes in it since High School (which I'm kinda regretting,  as it would be useful for my job).

            I know English and I took Spanish in high school and still know at least some of it,  though I haven't really had much chance to use it. Other than that,  I know a smattering of German,  French,  Japanese and Mandarin Chinese. And by "smattering, " I mean basically a few words here and there.

            @Kuroi: French immersion might be a bit different from the basic system,  since... well,  it's immersion. That's how you actually learn a language. I learned more in my first three months in Montreal than all 8 years of French in school.

            Yeah,  very addicting song.

Plus the "Pinkie!" the crowd gives wen Pinkie gets back to her old self is just awesome. Plus it's a nice nod to possibly <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czOlT05QABk">the most feel-good song in the series.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

            Keg: True. But the point is that it was an option at my high school,  which proves that education system is at least doing a decent job out here. Although not many people speak French outside of the schools,  so it's not exactly a practical thing (in fact,  I think Mandarin is a more practical second language here,  as we get lots of Chinese exchange students at the nearby university).
