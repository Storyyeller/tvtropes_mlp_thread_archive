            I think it's because neither of them take themselves even close to seriously. It's a perfect blend of fun.
<p></p>And I'm really not sure about the whole Wierd-Al episode thing. The first I heard of it,  I assumed he was just making a joke...I can't say if it's an actual thing or just a really,  really persistent rumor.

            I'm kinda iffy on the thought of him being a guest star on the show. Though they'll probably just get him to write a song,  or make him a background gag somewhere.

I remember one of the first clips of this show I saw was the cliffhanger where Nightmare Moon appears,  and I was thinking something like "Oh,  man... Looks like midway through the first season,  a rival monarch declares war on the ponies' happy little homeland,  and nothing will ever be the same again!  Goodbye,  lighthearted Looney Tunes with a message!"
<p></p>So I think you're right,  it would be neat if next time we just have the spectral terror of the villain linger over everyone's heads for multiple episodes,  long before the actual confrontations,  and we see more of how friendship gets our favorite ponies through the toughest times.

            Hm. Bumped up thread for my story on Ponychan. Reaction seems fairly positive so far. Feeling more confident.
<p></p>Now I just need to continue writing it. And the other Pony fanfic I have going.
<p></p>And that hilarious "Glee" thing I started.
<p></p>And that story with the lazy,  rude,  sex-obsessed dragon.
<p></p>And that story with the vampire librarian. Haven't written anything for that in a year...
<p></p>And that play I was working on about gaming forums that's in Live Bloginations.
<p></p>And also those roleplays I'm involved in.

Well,  the Generation 1 cartoon was special because it didn't have one Big Bad; instead,  it took more of a Courage the Cowardly Dog approach,  where all manner of creeps and curses were converging on that little patch of paradise for whatever reason.  It made you wonder "What is WITH this place that everyone and everything in the surrounding area wants to destroy it or take it over?"
<p></p>But Friendship Is Magic is more about the interpersonal relationships,  so... New idea: The Big Bad is EVERYBODY!
<p></p>Everybody has nightmares about being stalked by Grogar,  only Grogar is now THAT FRIEND OF YOURS YOU HAD A PROBLEM WITH!
<p></p>Everybody fears the Evil Enchantresses of Gloom Mountain,  for THEY ARE YOUR WACKY NEIGHBORS!
<p></p>Everybody wants to steal magic wands by surfing on magma,  because HOW DO YOU SURF ON MAGMA I DON'T EVEN

But problem with G1 was that bad guys were impresive and scary at first but in the end they got beated almost like Dr Doofersmiths.
<p></p>It make wonder why good guys in that show are so pussy. If they living in such dangerous place so why they are not more badass (most badass of them are human children). Good Guys from MLPFIM are stronger and they could survive or offer resistance to Tirac or Grogar forces.
<p></p>Yeah I whant to see more bad guy in season 2.

            How much do I like drawing ponies? Enough that I stay up 2.5 hours later than usual so I don't miss a day! Weee! A lot of this was rushed,  and therefore not my best work,  but it was still fun and coming up with a couple pony designs on the fly was neat too (see the two '<a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs">O Cs</a>' at the end,  which are my interpretations of Cereal and Sethisto.  Yes,  I drew Sethisto as a mare.  I based the decision on a comment Phoe made.).

            Tirac could be easly destroyed by Element of Harmony,  only if Celestria (and Luna) doesn't manage to get him first.
<p></p>Same with Grogar (his dueal with Celestria would be epic). And his counquest,  well Equestria have army (at least royal guard who propably have similar number to Grogar minions),  also ponies can form militia (like Appleloosans),  not mentions other,  like Bisons,  Griphons,  Diamond Dogs,  or Dragons (they problably don't like idea of their terytories being invaded,  and propably some group of dragons have alliance with ponies).
<p></p>BTW Where in G1 in time of Grogar invasion are other monsters and villains (in situations like this some bad guys joins invaders and other joins heroes side).

            I'm not really up on G1 outside of the earliest episodes.
<p></p>But it wouldn't even take an Element to do Tirac in—FIM Applejack by herself could probably just buck him to death.
<p></p><hr>
<p></p>In other news,  I have a question:
<p></p>I just rewatched "A Dog and Pony Show" and.... why is Spike breathing into that paper bag when the ponies are carrying him back to the scene of the kidnapping?  Is this some sort of home remedy for something that I've never heard of or what?

            Then Grogar and Tirek would need a power upgrade.
<p></p>Seeing Grogar and Celestia exchanging beams of massive energy would be so freaking epic that only an 8 episode arc or a film would suffice.
<p></p>Oh,  and I wouldn't mind a yeti (or whatever was that thing)... I kinda liked that guy.

<p></p>But Tirac can't even be in Equestria or even place like Everfree Forest beacause Celestria could lokade him and kick his plot.
<p></p>Grogar at least with his city have place from where he can strike,  but knowing Celestria she propably could make rebelion of his army much quicker.
