            I mentioned before that I'm going to GalaCon. That was a lot of hours ago. So much,  that it's enough time for the first day of the con to pass,  with me visiting it. Coincidentally,  that's exactly what happened.
<p></p>It was pretty awesome,  beginning with the greeting and introduction of the guests. The best part was when they introduced Discord's German VA. When they mentioned that he also voiced Data from Star Trek,  they showed a picture of Darth Vader at first.
<p></p>Then,  game presentations. First,  a game by Penta Studios (who also made "Waiting is Magic",  among other things). It's a 2D platformer,  where you play Rainbow Dash. You can fly,  fight enemies,  talk with ponies and fly around. It's just a short demo (was also playable in the game room),  but the full version is supposed to be an open world game,  where you can do quests and stuff. It also comes with an editor (that was also shown at the presentation),  where you can make you own adventures.  <br>Then Legends of Equestria. They showed character creation and... well,  walking and flying around (and doing barrel rolls) in Ponyville. They also wanted to show Canterlot,  but when the player traveled to it,  the game crashed. Whether it's because the game is so buggy or because the old laptop wasn't well optimized for the game (in Ponyville it lagged like hell,  but it was fine indoors),  I don't know. But it will probably be a long time,  until a release-able version comes out. It was also playable in the game room,  but without UI (not sure if it's an earlier version),  so no going to Canterlot. Funniest thing was when a player was walking while leaning to the side. Like,  halfway between standing and lying. Apparently,  it was a bug that happened when you tried to swim or something. it was funny,  in any case.
<p></p>Then,  panel with Andrea Libman and Peter New. Somebody asked them what their relationship with Warhammer 40k is. Peter voiced some characters in the video games. Andrea had no idea what W40k is. Also,  fun fact: There was a time when Peter,  as usual,  went to the studio to record very few lines for a character he voiced (which he assumed to be Big Mac),  there was one thing he didn't know: It was for Equestria Girls. It wasn't until he asked Megan McCarthy,  whether that human pony thing,  he just heard about,  is real that he learned of this. Also,  somebody asked Andrea to say "Hey,  hey,  hey,  stay out of my shed" in Fluttershy's voice. It was... inappropriately adorable (although,  didn't she do this before on another con?).
<p></p>Panel with John Joseco. Say about him,  what you want,  but he is a pretty sympathetic guy. But Homestuck is too long for him to start it (yes,  somebody asked about it).
<p></p>Finally,  there was <a class="urllink" href="http://mylittlekaraoke.com/">My Little Karaoke<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (one could even win physical copies of it). That was pretty much the last thing I did. I never went on a mic and I never brought up enough courage to actually wish for "Flutter Wonder". But I didn't care. I just had too much fun. And it's not like you only were allowed to sing with a mic. When "Smile,  Smile,  Smile" came up,  pretty much nobody stayed silent. And even I found it impossible to not sing along (not that I wanted to). I also sang at "Winter Wrap Up",  "Giggle at the Ghostly",  "Love is in Bloom" and "Gypsy Bard". Even though I never heard the latter. I don't like FiW,  but they can do catchy songs.
<p></p>Pity,  that there won't be any MLK tomorrow. But instead,  there will be "Trotmania". I suppose it will be a DDR thing with MLP songs.
<p></p>So,  I guess you can say that I had fun. And that I'll look forward to tomorrow,  the long train ride (I will arrive at home on Monday after 2 AM) notwithstanding. I should finally make some photos of cosplayers then.

It's probably not what I'd think of first just by looking at her,  but that might be fixed simply by seeing her in her clothes instead of her underwear.

            At the moment I'm just coming up with the plot and need to see if it's any good. If something's not quite right with this idea let me know. Well the name of this fan series is My Dimensional Ponies and it's about Bradley Cooper a typical British teenager who's tired of his boring life and wants something interesting to happen in his life. He unwittingly gets his wish granted when he receives a package he did not order and finds a mysterious crystal inside no sooner does he pick up the crystal something strange happens. In a flash of light,  Bradley is then send through a vortex and ends up in a grim and dark castle which is now unfortunately inhabited by Discord who has corrupted the castle under his influence. And that's all I've got so far,  I'm still writing down the plot as we speak.

<p></p>That's not bad. But if I can justify that,  I need them in their underwear to show off their body type.
<p></p>But I'm glad you think it may work.  I think once she's in suitable clothes she might be better looking.  Although derpibooru disagrees.

            So I was just reading through my old facebook timeline,  because I do that sometimes,  and I realized: The official Facebook page some time ago actually had a poll on where Shiny and Cadance should take their honeymoon.

            <span class="blue">I think the problem with Shiny and Cadance is that they always just show up and play a really minor role in any episode they're in.  Even in the wedding episode the real Cadance only had like 2 minutes of screentime.  I think they're good enough characters to be considered,  if not quite main cast members,  at least secondary.  Throw em an episode every now and then.  Of course we're still waiting on Celestia to have an episode...</span>

When Bradley first arrives at the castle,  Discord will taunt him that he KNEW he was coming and who he is,  realistically Bradley has no idea what Discord is talking about and understandably demands to know why he's in the castle,  why Discord knows who he is. Of course the spirit of Disharmony doesn't play ball and doesn't answer Bradley's question directly.

            @Irish Zombie: Thanks!  When I saw that picture and the challenge,  I was pretty sure I could think of something,  and once I noticed that Spike's hat looked like <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLeach" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLeach">Mc Leach</a>'s hat then the idea came to my mind.
<p></p>By the way,  I finally have a friend who is a pony fan who I know in person.  She was a friend of mine from before who I share being <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a> fans with,  but she's watched some of the new show with me and really seems to like it.  She knew about it from before,  because she babysat for kids who watched it,  and is a high school teacher who has some bronies in her class.  She liked it well enough earlier,  and remembered the older series too,  but today she stayed at my house (she doesn't live in town so this was a rare treat) and we watched some of the episodes and it got her very interested in it and she liked how cute it is.  I told her about Derpy and since we watched Suited For Success,  I pointed out DJ Pon-3 and explained about her significance as well.  She definitely seems to like Pinkie and Fluttershy,  and said that she knew someone who Fluttershy reminded her of.
<p></p>So now we share another interest besides just being <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a> fans,  now we're both <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a> fans as well!

            @Applelight: There's nothing wrong with the drawing itself,  I'm just not sure why AJ would have that sort of figure.  As noted elsewhere,  it makes a lot more sense for her to have bulkier legs rather than carrying her weight high.  Not that it couldn't work.  The drawing itself is adorable.

Body shape is determined just as much by genetics as by how you work out,  so you could draw her either way.
