I was going to suggest that either they feed of grffons or that they are embodiments of hatred themselves and so In someways ponies working through their hate and mistrust was effectively genocide.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            Y'know,  in order to create a benevolent version of "The Rains Of Castamere" (Tywin Lannister's badass boast song from ASOIAF) for Princess Celestia I came up with an idea:
<p></p>I like to imagine that there was a prominent Unicorn noble who had just inherited a castle from his deceased parents. Too prideful,  he refused to leave his keep when the others travelled to Equestria to escape the Windigos. He kept with him his family and his servants and his guards. He lasts for a scant few years before ponies start wanting to leave. He refuses and keeps them locked away. One day,  a young Celestia (at this point completely unconnected to Equestria in any way,  she was just travelling) arrives and urges him to forsake his pride and to leave for Equestria. She eventually succeeds in coaxing him and the descendents of this stallion become real close to the princesses over the millenia <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
