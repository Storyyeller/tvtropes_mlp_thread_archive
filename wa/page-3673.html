            not stated right out,  but there were 16 books on the Twilights bookshelf that she got the books from.
<p></p>so,  how's that look? just a idea I had,  not sure if it works though.

<p></p>@Bad Occam's RAZOR!! The episode panned across the entire shelf while Twi was also saying that line. What's the easiest assumption to make?

            lol The foals would love that.
<p></p>We have to keep in mind that one of the opening paragraphs tells it like the series is completed,  because the author had to have hid the manuscripts in the university for publishers to find and then went on to live his/her life.  16 is still a good number.

            I am for having a set limit!
<p></p>If it's an ongoing series,  that brings up some controversy.  The author is writing this in secret,  so it will be VERY hard for him/her to do that with authorities trying to track her down knowing that the series is on-going because of the copyright ownership.  It's held under Polo House,  Inc.,  but that's only because there is no estate.  Now if the author is still working on it?  Would there be debate over where the rights go?
<p></p>It will work best if the series is complete.  If there are people are soooo against that,  I am open to adding more volumes,  but the series as a whole should still be complete..

            I'm all for having a set limit to the number on the page,  but in-verse it could still be ongoing,  thre just waiting for new manuscrpits to appear in the drawer.
<p></p>As to the young foals series,  we could cap that at a small,  single digit number as well.

            I doubt that anyone is actually trying to track the author down. She probably has a secret agreement with the editors,  and they just play up the mysterious author thing for publicity.
<p></p>By the way,  is there any name for the language that ponies speak?

            I'm FOR there being a set limit of 16 as far as the page is concerned.
<p></p>But i'm also for there still being more books in the series that simply haven't been written and/or found yet.

            I'm not against a set limit. I'd prefer it if the series was still having books being released if only so Rainbow and Twilight could go to a book release together.
<p></p>I am against the whole mystery author thing,  but I've been outvoted so,  yeah.
