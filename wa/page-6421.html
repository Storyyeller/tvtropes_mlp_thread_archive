            The truth is,  some people will always act like assholes. They don't have to be part of this fanbase to do so,  but unfortunately,  we've attracted our fair share. Once something gets too big,  it doesn't matter how good your intentions are,  some parts of it are going to get worse.
<p></p>It's always been hard for me to learn to ignore stuff,  but I can honestly say it's a skill this fandom is helping me learn.

            @ Kegi,  I think your just being overly pessimistic,  yeah as any group grows in size there will be a corresponding increase in the number of statistical outliers,  but there will also be a much larger growth in those that form the middle of the Bell Curve. Yes you will find someone for any idiotic thing you can think of,  am I saying every brony is perfect,  Buck no! Yes you will have people like you describe,  but far as I've seen they a very small minority,  I'd rather look at all the good that I've seen,  the shear love and dedication,  the stories of people who have been helped out by this show and the fanbase,  just the shear output of creative energy people dedicate to the fandom.
<p></p>People are passionate about this show,  and yes that does tend to cloud peoples judgment and make them a bit sensitive or more likely to lash out,  that's just human nature,  you have knee jerk reactions,  then deliberate,  planned actions,  and while the knee jerk ones are all over the place,  the actually planned out and thought out actions of this fanbase are almost entirely positive. I think it really says something that anytime I've seen something that would cause a massive flame war or shitstorm somewhere else,  I end up seeing far FAR more comments from people trying to talk everyone into calming down and staying cool,  to just think it through and not do any think rash...then I see stuff from people that actually need that advice.
<p></p>and @ L Mage..huh? all we've been doing is responding to his question/asking him how he's liked it so far

            That makes absolutely no sense,  Ginger. You can't go half and half on spoilers,  because the whole point of them is that you <em>don't know what they are</em>. It is literally impossible to know whether or not said spoiler will be something that you don't want spoiled or not,  so you either have to be prepared to have everything spoiled or swear off them completely.
<p></p>And Azula <em>didn't</em> lose to Zuko,  IIRC,  <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she lost to Katara.</span>

            OH GOD! How can someone ruin THAT!! That's,  like,  the biggest of all spoilers! D:<
<p></p>And I actually find that Azula's downfall works. She doesn't just go crazy and lose. There's a very very very large number of factors that play into that.
<p></p>Or you can just skip the finale and watch everything else. It really does pick up and the ride is really fun,  even if you don't like the finale.

<p></p>Well,  technically speaking she <em>doesn't</em> lose to her brother exactly,  she physically kills Zuko and Katara heals him. They double team her.

            Yeah,  she almost wins. The true reason why she goes crazy is because she IS defeated and she had never truly experienced that before.

            I don't think Azula lost because she was going insane,  she gave Zuko <em>and</em> Katara a run for their money before she went down. She's still a frighteningly powerful firebender. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryingToCatchMeFightingDirty" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryingToCatchMeFightingDirty">Also,  still crafty enough to aim at what was essentially a bystander,  throwing Zuko off completely.</a>

            @Ginger: If you're always going on about how most people don't agree with you,  why are you assuming that you'd share their feelings on the finale?  It's like what everybody else said: watch it and form your own opinions on it.
