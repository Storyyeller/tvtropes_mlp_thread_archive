            Again the whole issue is that the way the site selects the top box is freaking idiotic.
<p></p>Then again given how the people running the site seem to be fucking assholes.. they might do that just to mess with people.

            ...actually,  I think they're assholes because the userbase isn't exactly sane.
<p></p>Check the comments out on one of those weirder fics sometime. Or on the older changes for the site. It was rather crazy.
<p></p>And if I had to deal with those guys for so long... I wouldn't be too nice to them after a while.
<p></p>Or maybe they really are jerks and I'm too optimistic,  I dunno.

            @Seraphem: There were idiots on both sides of that,  and that's all I'm going to say about it.
<p></p>Honestly,  the main problem with things like that is that 90% of the time the people who are at the heads of these sites are in that position not because they know how to deal with people,  but because they have the technical know-how to create the site.  The guys who run Fimfic run Fimfic because they either helped create it,  or hopped on board early before it exploded in popularity.  As such most of them have technical knowledge,  but aren't great at the PR side of things.  They're no more assholish than 90% of the userbase,  it's just that none of that 90% is running the site.  I'm guessing that if you or me were the heads of a website we probably wouldn't be any better after having to deal with so many idiots for so long.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">To be fair he's not the only person who approves stories.  The other thing is that the whole point of fimfic was to allow <em>anything</em> to be posted so it wouldn't fall into the EQD trap of having incredibly specific and elitist standards for things. The specific issue isn't that the stuff exists on the site,  it's that said stuff keeps getting so much attention.

</li><li>Fanart of Twi in a lab coat and goggles,  taking notes.
</li><li>Fanart of Twi in a lab coat and goggles,  in front of an atom symbol,  with the text "Time for SCIENCE!" at the bottom.
</li><li>Fanart of Twi in a lab coat and black goggles,  with a mad grin on her face as she prepares to throw the switch on some contraption.
</li><li>Show-style vector art of Twi in glasses,  smiling at a hypodermic needle with a glowing,  green liquid inside. She's bordered above and below by the text "Stand back! I'm going to try SCIENCE."
</li><li>Show-style vector art of Twi in goggles,  levitating a flask of something.
</li></ol><p></p>If you've enabled avatar sharing,  I can transfer any of those into your avatar collection.
