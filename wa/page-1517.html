            Telekinesis has never shown the ability to completely immobilize someone. Whenever an entire body is being picked up,  they can still squirm around. AJ gets TK'd by Rarity? AJ just pulls out her lasso and wraps it around Rarity's legs
<p></p>TK also requires aim. If AJ can dodge around fast enough then there's nothing she can do

            Why do these discussions on respective pony ability always come down to who could win in a contest?  Doesn't Applejack get points for being the most grounded pony?  If I had a problem she's the first pony I'd talk to about it,  since she's the most sensible most of the time.  This is a show about friendship,  not epic duels.

<p></p>Meh,  I'm just going with 'bigger and stronger' thing. Still,  even so,  anything they can do the other species's can do,  like unicorns can compensate for their strength with their magic to even it up,  while using their magic to do things that Earth ponies couldn't. Same with Pegasus; what can EP's do that the others can't? (and yes,  count their ability to fly and use magic). Don't say 'they're stronger' because that isn't something that only they can do; anything they can do with their strength the unicorns can do with magic,  while the Pegasus can do it with........acceleration.
<p></p>Oh,  well I guess they always have their connection with the earth,  though we haven't really seen any actual use for it unless it's something passive that we don't have concrete evidence on like growing things.

        <div class="post-content">
            <div class="quoteblock">The assistant tapped the thin metal frame dubiously.
<p></p>"Are you sure about this,  Ottoman?"
<p></p>"Positive. This will be a boon to all of ponykind."
<p></p>"I don't know; I mean there are other ways that are just as good."
<p></p>"Yes,  but one is pretty slow and the other one costs bits to use."
<p></p>"So will <em>this</em>, " the assistant said,  tapping the metal frame again. "Quite a lot too."
<p></p>Ottoman sighed. "Yes,  but it'll be a one-time payment. It'll make that money back and it's far more efficient to boot. Anyway,  I'm sure I can make it cheaper once I find a way to mass produce. And watch how hard you tap that. That's my life's work you're ponyhandling."
<p></p>"This thing is <em>awfully</em> large,  too. And that <em>smell</em>…"
<p></p>Ottoman sighed again. "Now you're just looking for excuses,  Steamer. First,  it's a prototype; it's simply a proof of concept and I've done that. It works. You've <em>seen</em> it work. I don't plan for them to be <em>nearly</em> as big as this when I finally put them into production. Second,  while I do admit the smell is a bit off-putting,  I'm sure can come up with something that isn't so bad given time. The influx of bits will make that easier."
<p></p>As his assistant mumbled to himself,  Ottoman thought back to the time months ago when he had originally had idea that led up to the creation of the device. The thought had simply struck him out of the blue as he was taking a walk to the market to restock his larder. He rushed home as fast as he could,  his grocery trip forgotten,  and started on the blueprints that very day before he forgot his idea.
<p></p>The design theory was solid,  but it needed some work. Well,  he had nothing but time. He was so overjoyed with this new project and the fact that his imagination had finally borne fruit that the time passed without him noticing. He wasn't that great an inventor; most of his inventions either didn't work properly or failed outright,  but this...<em>this</em> looked to be the idea that would make up for all of his past failures.
<p></p>It was <em>brilliant</em>,  even if he did say so himself. Over the days and then weeks,  he improved upon the design,  and then improved further still. <em>This</em> needed to go <em>there</em> and <em>that</em> could be replaced with <em>this</em>,  which would raise the efficiency by almost twenty percent...
<p></p>Finally,  after all his efforts the device was ready to be put into practice. He hired an assistant,  Steamer,  to help with the building of the very first model. Big solid fellow,  Steamer; muscular and smart. When it had been finished,  Ottoman activated it and stepped back. It came to life with a whirring sound,  and Ottoman clapped his hooves on the ground in pure joy. It functioned. By Celestia,  <em>it functioned</em>.
<p></p>From that moment on,  he worked on on creating the frame it would sit in and the controls for it. That was the hardest part and he was glad he'd hired Steamer; Ottoman wasn't the strongest pony in Equestria and quite a bit of heavy work was involved. He watched Steamer every step of the way,  to ensure his assistant built it to his exact specifications.
<p></p>"What about the controls?",  asked Steamer,  bringing Ottoman out of his reverie.
<p></p>"Well,  I <em>think</em> I've made them as simple as I can. You see,  you push this and then once it gets going you pull this and turn that…"
<p></p>"It seems.."
<p></p>"'…a bit complicated'. I <em>knew</em> you were going to say that. It will take a bit of learning,  I admit,  but the benefits will far outweigh that."
<p></p>Steamer trotted around the boxy machine,  and gave it another dubious look. Ottoman shook his head and rolled his eyes in exasperation.
<p></p>"<em>Relax</em>,  Steamer. I guarantee you this will not only put my name…our names in the history books,  but will soon become something no land pony can live without! On top of that,  my uncle Davenport will <em>finally</em> be proud of me I'm sure!"
<p></p>He gave a wooden wheel a gentle stroke with a hoof. "And I shall call it: 'The Ottomobile'!"
<p></p>"<em>That's</em> a bit audacious of you."
<p></p>"Cut it out,  Steamer."</div>
