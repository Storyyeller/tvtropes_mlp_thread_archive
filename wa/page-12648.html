            Scootaloo switching to MDW's side seems to only really be their to drive another metaphorical stake into RD's heart. It really wasn't necessary and wasn't handled all that well.

            @Apple,  last page: I wouldn't go '['that'' far. I mean it's annoying,  yeah,  but I get their reaosning. Plus I have a comfy chair,  a room to myself,  and a nice view of the open spire that runs through the building. It's basically a corner office. I feel like I got a promotion!
<p></p>So... <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MAre" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MAre">M Are</a> Do Well then?
<p></p>Yeah,  I'm just gonna say it was a really interesting idea that was kinda poorly exectuted but overall not inherently bad. Some people have it as their wonk,  fair enough. Some people have OAB or FPK as their wonk. I didn't like it,  but I sure don't hate it and the writer has gone on to do pretty good things since then.

            Okay. Anyone who complins that Scootaloo was "switching from RD's side to Mare-Do-Well's" is being completely ridiculous. Scootaloo never stopped being nice to RD. In fact she never seemed to realise that RD <em>had a problem with Mare-Do-Well</em>. <em>She was inviting her to the celebration!</em> Does being RD's fan mean that you're not allowed to like anypony else!?
<p></p>As for the cockiness,  they were complimenting <em>Mare-Do-Well. Who none of them were. Because they all are. That was part of the point.</em>
<p></p>And how was Flutershy out of character?
<p></p>I don't even see any of them as being particularly out of character.
<p></p>I'll agree withthe assesment of Dragon Quest though.

            I didn't mind MMDW too much. HWE,  however,  is one of my least favorite episodes of all time. People say that the episode redeemed her,  but I cannot agree with them on that one. And what is this,  she wrote Dragon Quest too?
<p></p>Well,  hot damn.

            For me,  <strong>that</strong> episode would be Ovar a Barrel,  I guess. And possibly Too Many Pinkie Pies,  but TMPP had too many good points for me to rate it too low.

            Let's see. My favourite episodes are:
<p></p>A Canterlot Wedding: Yes. Hated by many people.
<p></p>Hurricane Fluttershy: I remember an extreme negative reaction from someone,  yes.
<p></p>Lesson Zero: This one was so hated by some peole that someone wrote a letter appologising on behalf of the bronie and begging that no more similar episodes be made.
<p></p>Return of Harmony: Yep. Hated by many people.
Yes. Hated.
It's About Time:
<p></p>Suited For Success: I wasn't really involved with the fandom in season 1,  so I don't know about this.
<p></p>Green Isn't Your Color: Ditto.
<p></p>Hearth's Warming Eve: Just been discussed.
<p></p>Luna Eclipsed: Yes. Hated.

            No they were being cocky, AJ specifically complimented Mare-Do-Well for strong legs, ....<em>her</em> strong legs, she easily could've complimented another aspect.
<p></p>Twilight did the same thing when Magical feats were performed, she could've complimented another part.
<p></p>To say "Oh boo-hoo haters they complimented Mare-Do-well because they all are" is a bullshit excuse for that.
<p></p>As for Fluttershy, she's not confrontational, she'd never go for that at all. It's not in her nature to go out and dethrone someone like that, she's just too <em>kind</em> for that.
<p></p>@Teeth Yeah I get what you're saying about "Friend In Deed", that episode was enjoyable but not really a stand out because of how it ended.

            Ah,  there was one: Episode Zero. A lot of people loved it,  but I honestly thought it went a bit too far too fast,  so in the end I didn't really care for it. just kinda forgot about it,  though.
<p></p>To be honest I'm not really involved enough in the fanon to know what's hated and what kisn't.

Standby for the small flaw in reasonign that Dash didn't KNOW they were MDW,  true,  but it's still a valid reason on their part.
<p></p>And the most Shy ever did was a flyby. She never competed with,  or dethroned Dash.

            @Sereg: Given that every episode has <em>somebody</em> who hates it,  I think you're overstating a bit. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">  I mean,  yes,  some people really dislike "Lesson Zero" and "Luna Eclipsed",  but when EQD had their episode poll,  those two won with a really solid margin.  The majority of the fandom has no problem with them.
<p></p>Also,  I think the reason that HWE was so average for me is that I'd much rather have character interaction that worldbuilding. Not that I dislike worldbuilding,  but that's not the reason I watch the show.  It's probably the same reason I didn't really care much for Family Appreciation Day.  If you gave me the choice between an episode tracing the history of Equestia,  and an episode featuring the mane cast sitting in a room arguing about which <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaringDo" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaringDo">Daring Do</a> book is best,  I'd probably prefer the latter.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Puddinghead was hilarious,  but that just proves my point.  The parts of the episode I enjoyed most were the sections where the ponies were just bouncing off of each other; the worldbuilding bits I could honestly take or leave.

            I think the closest thing I have to 'that' episode,  would be Bridle Gossip or A Dog And Pony Show. Oddly enough they're among the most popular of season 1.

<p></p>Also,  I honestly don't get how people thought the message of DQ was "Those teen dragons were evil,  therefore <em>all</em> dragons are evil unless raised by ponies".  I'm pretty certain not all dragons are like Garble and his goons.
<p></p>Also,  Sereg,  what "extremely negative" reaction are you referring to?  I honestly can't remember.
