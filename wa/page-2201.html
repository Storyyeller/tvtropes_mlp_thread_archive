            If that was her intention,  that'd be a pretty hard left from her usual attitude,  opening of "The Best Night Ever" aside.
<p></p>I remain convinced that she was merely unable to convincingly act dispassionate about the gem,  after she kind of gave away her thoughts on the stone <em>before</em> Spike brought up his intentions for it. Indeed,  if that is the case,  and she was aware of his affections at the time,  then she likely wouldn't want to snub his affections by refusing a gift,  and so instead resolved to make him know that it was appreciated,  to the point of starting a whole line of outfits with him as her main inspiration,  and all but enshrining the thing,  so he knows that his gift isn't gathering dust in some box marked "to be used when inspiration strikes".
<p></p>Of course,  the scene can be viewed as ambiguous,  so I doubt either of us will convince the other of their interpretation,  Mousa.

            @Red Savant,  Of course there's nothing wrong with wanting something,  that's not the issue,  she acquired his <em>birthday gift</em> and quite literally took candy from a baby.

            Spike needs to know the rules of the game.
His full dragon form was cool until the wonderbolts shaved his head. I guess he is a wingless breed then? I wonder if there are dragon types equivalent to pony types. Earth dragons,  Flying dragons,  Magic dragons?

            Enlong's got my take on it,  pretty much.  She didn't "acquire" his birthday present; she <em>was given</em> his present to himself on his own insistence,  and he outright stated (showing no regret at all) that seeing her accept it would make him happier than eating it ever could.
<p></p>Anyway,  bedtime.  Hope the new episode's a good one!

            Okay,  I rewatched that scene,  and I think I agree with Mousa  that Rarity's actions went further than bad poker face into deliberately flirting the gem away from him.  I still think that she makes up for it in the rest of the episode though.
