            I still tink people are a bit to hard on AFID. yes it was a bit contrived that she found the love of his life,  but given what we've seen,  it isn't a stretch to think Cranky would forgive her after she did so. And SHE did learn the not everypony wants ponies around 24/7 some just need to be left alone.
<p></p>Yes she ended up firends with Cranky,  but she would have been fine without him doing so and left him alone. She did learn,  she just didn't quite connect the dots between,  "Doesn't want to be frineds" with "Doesn't want me around period." The second half had nothing to do with being his friend she just HAD to apologize.
<p></p>IDK just seems in character for her to learn something,  and not quite stop to think about all it's implications. The only bit that really seemed a bit OOC was her yelling to the whole town the Cranky was bald.

            I'm tempted to toss Swarm of the Century in there,  because I still think the problem is more on Pinkie's end than the other ponies.  She knows the solution to the problem,  but <em>never</em> actually tells them that.

Twilight basically tells her that she should stop bothering him,  and she promptly agrees and starts stalking the poor guy.  There isn't any hint that she intends to leave him alone until after she's on his good side.

<p></p>And add MMDW to the bungled list. only episode where the pony learning a lesson had that lesson dictated to her by some pony else.

<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> It was established all she wanted was to apologize. At that point it wasn't her need to be riends driving her,  it was her conscious. She new she had hurt him,  and wanted make sure he new how sorry she was. She had given up being his instant best friend,  she just didn't realize it was teh WHAT not the WHY that was annoying him.

            I think that the Aesop in <em>Mare Do Well</em> was quite evident,  actually. And it was very evident throughout pretty much the entire episode,  too.

            Yeah,  I actually think MMDW got it's point across <em>too</em> clearly.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">  My gripe wasn't so much that the moral was badly demonstrated (it wasn't,  that's one of the things it got right),  but that RD never really learned it herself.  The rest of the cast basically told it to her and she just sort of repeated it back to them so they'd leave her alone.

            yes the batman/darkwing duck references where the only saving grace for that episode.

            Night all those going to bed.
<p></p>In just over an hour,  I will have completed my final nightshift ever!
<p></p>Anyway,  yeah,  I agree that even the weakest episodes of this shoe have their merits.  And,  just want to go on record as saying,  I find this show geniuenely hilarious most of the time.  Especially when Pinkie and Rarity are concerned.  I can't say anything about the characterisation that hasn't already been said.
<p></p>As to AFID,  although the outcome may have been fudged a little,  just remember that this show must always maintain a certain degree of optimism to it.  The only othe outcome would have been for Cranky to hold a grudge...quite rightly in my opinion.  And that's a little bleak.  I can picture pinkie having to avoid him in the street.  Not a nice thought.
