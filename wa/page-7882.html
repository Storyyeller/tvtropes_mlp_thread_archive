            @ moussa,  I thought it was a load of horse-apples.
<p></p>the show makers didn't HAVE a demographic they were making the show "just" for. They simply wanted to make the best damn show they could. The intended ANYONE could enjoy it,  and we do.
<p></p>I don't even get where the hell he's getting that "we want to change the show into something just for us and not for litle girls"..waht the buck? are there some that MAY want that yeah,  but most I know of want the show to stay right how it is.
<p></p>All he's bitching about is some fan made stuff he doesn't like..guess what...you no likey,  you no looky...don't tell other people what they can and can't draw because it's based on "A girl's show" that was never intended as JUST a girls show. EVERY SHOW has stuff like that,  Rule34 NO EXCEPTIONS!. Do you have to like it,  hell no.

            @Chad:sadly,  I didn't <em>quite</em> learn the truth on my own. My roommate spoilered pretty much all the endings when he looked up how to get them for me. But it was still a <em>bit</em> of a surprise,  though I did have a 'holy shit' moment where pretty much everything done in the past clicked for me.
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yes,  even the Izanami part. Although I actually could have gotten something about that on my own - when Adachi was talking,  I happened to notice that he never said how he got the team on the Midnight channel. Meaning that they were coming from a <em>third</em> source.</span>

But I also maxed the strength,  sun,  Devil,  Heirophant and justice links. So,  you know,  that's gotta count for something.

<p></p>It doesn't help that the target audience doesn't care if they show the same episode 5 times in a row and wouldn't undersand subtlety if it bit them in the face. There's not much to work with there,  though I guess they could slip some parental bonus in there.

            Eh,  the Derpy edit didn't <em>negate</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomNod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomNod">Fandom Nod</a>,  it just lessened it (the new version gives her the same amount of screentime and number of lines she had in the old version). Now if they had <em>cut</em> her from the episode,  <em>that</em> would've been negating it.

<p></p>Well there's a number of possibilities. Back in the old days,  it was likely through pure chance. But nowadays a lot of them are put in the official game guides,  or just discovered through hacking.

            <span class="blue">I actually really love the way Persona 4 forces you to get the true ending.  Unlike practically every other game,  it requires you to actually THINK,  and considering it's a detective game (sort of),  that's a good thing.  And that one scene turns the protagonist from a supporting role to the main driving force of the story,  so it was a great moment.  I also love the part where you are forced to deduct the identity of the true killer,  and you (as the player) are actually given a list of EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER in the game to pick from.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">The identity of the killer absolutely blew my brother's mind when he played.  Even after he'd seen a video on youtube that should have spoiled it for him,  he just couldn't believe it.</span>

            really i just have to agree with the Pony-Confesions blog post (no lin cuase the picture is NSFW)
<p></p><em>When I first tried to branch out and draw rule 34 just for the heck of it,  I received extreme criticism from other artists that I knew.</em>
<p></p><em>NSFW artists just seem to be a lot more open minded and accepting of other artists.</em>
<p></p><em>People claim that rule 34 and NSFW is killing the fandom,  but that’s just complete nonsense. If anything,  they’re some of the friendliest people the fandom has to offer.</em>
<p></p>I agree completely with that. Don't tell other people what they can and can't do,  unless it effects you personally,  you have no say,  you don't like something,  then dn't search for it/look at it.

            @Whatshisgame: The reason it feels negated is because it basically changed everything about the character that caused the fans to latch onto her.  The fact that she had the derped eyes and was actually called Derpy made it clear that it was a fan thing and not just some random pony.   As it currently is,  the scene is non-specific enough that you could plug any other pegasus in there without really changing much.  I mean,  the derped eyes is the whole reason the character was ever popular.
