            From my experience,  people who are rabid fans of anything tend (not always though) to be the underdogs of society and are therefore prey for all the bastards out there who need to feel like a man by screwing with someone else.
<p></p>Im not saying this to be offensive just Ive been a Trekkie,  a Furry,  and a Brony now and I see similar patterns.

            @Perpetual: Nah,  I get that feeling too.  Sure,  I have lots of stuff stressing me out,  but it's mostly Twilight type stress; it's not <em>really</em> a big deal,  but it freaks me out anyway.  The worst thing I've had to deal with recently was my grandparents being moved into an assisted living home,  and even that went pretty smoothly.  I guess I'm just lucky to have solid family and friends.

<p></p>@Applelight,  my experience is they not only get away with it,  but you end up looking worse for it. Bullies exist to make you miserable,  make you look like the bad guy,  and get away scot free.

            Well,  if he keeps it up,  I'm sure <em>somebody</em> will eventually call him on it.
<p></p>As for being bullied,  I haven't really been. The closest I've come to that was an asshole at my college dorm who liked to troll.  He realized that I was the most chill guy on the wing and quite explicitly informed me that it was his goal to make me flip out at him before I graduated.  This usually took the form of coming into my room while I was trying to work or sleep and bothering me,  usually by means of pretending to hump me or something.  Fortunately,  he failed,  and at worst I just got really annoyed.

            I think what this shows is that normally people only speak up if they do have drama,  thus leading to a skewed perception.

            @Mousa: Grudges serve no purpose other than making your angry.  If there's nothing you can do to make it stop,  stewing in it to deliberately make yourself angrier about it is pretty much the worst thing you can do,  because in the event that you snap and go off on them,  you'll inevitably end up worse off for it.
<p></p>@Turtle: Good to hear.

<p></p>Sorry mate.
<p></p>@ Grudges are bad
<p></p>I <em>beg</em> to differ.  I find myself much more focused,  driven and optumistic when working to destroy someone who's crossed me.
<p></p>I can't tell you how great it is to see the look on their face when you've got them too.

            Well all this would probably explain why I feel more strongly about Diamond Tiara needing her just desserts more than others would seem. I find the blackmail is worth more than losing her Editor-in-Cheif title and getting a bit of ink on her.
