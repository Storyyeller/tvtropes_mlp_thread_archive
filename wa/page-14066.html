            I'll agree that those two were her best ones. but,  Wonderbotls simply felt so different from her others,  I wouldn't be surprised that the other writers or at least Megan went through and co-wrote it,  or made sure to revise it and make it something people would like. Trying to win back the crowd for her.
<p></p>HWE,  the best parts were ones that played to her strengths,  it was all new characters,  so no having to worry about them being OOC. And conflict and arguing was core to the story. not simply thrown in because she likes it. And the backstage bickering between the mane 6 was the one weak part,  and it was pure Williams.
<p></p>She's not a bad writer,  she's simply not a good writer for MLP. She doenst take continuity into account,  and is clearly used to and prefers to make the characters and setting alter to fit her story. Not shape her story to fit the characters and setting.

From what I've heard,  every episode is a collaboration between nearly the whole writing staff. The credited writer is just the head for that particular episode.

<p></p>RD and even the mane 6 a bit. But even more so,  ALL OF PONYVILLE,  the setting itself felt wrong. Nothing like any other episode.
<p></p>PYHD,  so many ponies acting so utterly dickish and rude. Cranking up how bad everypony could be. The ONLY thing that saves that ep for me and keeps it out of the "Bad" catagory is how AWESOME Iron Will was.
<p></p>Dragon Quest. no OOC,  but more needlessly cranked up antoginism and jerkyness.

            Eh,  I don't think her episodes were that bad either. The only ones I didn't care for were MMDW and Dragon Quest; with the others ranging from decent (Hearths Warming Eve,  Spike at Your Service,  Putting Your Hoof Down) to awesome (Wonderbolts Academy).  She does have issues with capturing the tone at points,  but I really don't think it's all that bad.  And honestly Spike wasn't <em>that</em> bad in SAYS.  Yeah,  he was klutzier than usual,  but it's not like he's been 100% competent before that either.  He's fallen off the latter in the library,  burned books on accident,  etc.  It just exaggerated a previously existing trait.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I still think you're exaggerating how much influence she specifically had on those episodes. If anything it's just happenstance that she worked on certain episodes that you don't like.  <em>Every</em> episode has multiple writers working on it,  so you can't blame her for every issue.

            @Narcissa:
<p></p>A Friend In Deed: Good song,  good moral,  I personally think that Pinkie got away with way too much,  though.
<p></p>Putting Your Hoof Down: A few minor background pony characterization issues,  but Iron Will is so awesome that I'm incapable of disliking the episode
<p></p>Read It And Weep: Very solid and entertaining
<p></p>A Canterlot Wedding: Also very solid.  Chrysalis is awesome.
<p></p>Luna Eclipsed: Luna is great,  although I think the resolution was a bit weird.
<p></p>Feeling Pinkie Keen: Good concept,  bobbled the moral really badly,  though.
<p></p>Hearth's Warming Eve: Enjoyable; good but not amazing.
<p></p>Over a Barrel: Never been a fan of this one. I don't care for any of the new characters and it felt like the mane cast didn't contribute much.
<p></p>The Return of Harmony: I love these; some of the best character writing in the show
<p></p>Keep Calm And Flutter On: definitely solid,  but would have benefited from being a two-parter so Discord and Fluttershy's interactions could be built up more.
