            If they had Rainbow being better than the Wonderbolts,  it would just raise the question of why they aren't offering to let her join.  It's more likely that she would do something that impresses them but still not actually be skilled enough to join yet.
<p></p>I do not get the Rainbow hate this season.  Peeps be crazy.

            @Steve By "shit season" you mean she had one episode that didn't do her any favors,  and <em>everyone else</em> was also out of character. She's been fine for the rest of it.

            Dash hasn't had a good season,  but it hasn't been horrible either.  MMDW was the only one that I think did any real damage (I still don't think the pet competition is nearly as bad as people make it out to be),  and Hurricane Fluttershy showed her being a lot better,  so I think it helped.  The season hasn't necessarily been good for her,  but it's not like she got treated horribly in every episode.

            I think Dash's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt Monkey</a> status is mostly due to the fact she's had more episodes than the others in Season Two. Same for the CMC. AJ and Twilight had more episodes in Season One for example so played the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerk Ass</a> <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt Monkey</a> more often (though Twilight balanced off Season Two with a *ahem* <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E3LessonZero" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E3LessonZero">notable center episode</a>). Season Three will likely have a couple other characters get the lion's share of episodes,  which due to the Aesop setup will likely mean they get the same treatment as Dash.
<p></p>The only element I fear might be going too far is making her the team's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommanderContrarian" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommanderContrarian">Commander Contrarian</a>,  which is usually a role that will mean she is constantly butting heads and screwing up,  though she is at least still getting <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartBall" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartBall">Smart Ball</a> moments.

            I figured Rainbow has enough natural ability to be on the wonderbolts,  she just needs more experience,  and above all her biggest issue would be working as a team,  not just trying to show off and be better then every other pony on the team.

            Yeah,  I could imagine RD,  trying out,  doing something that's technically impressive,  but getting rejected because she couldn't hack the team stuff or follow directions.

            That would be a good route for a Wonderbolt episode to take I think.  Having her be at or close to the skill level she needs to be at,  but being terrible at working as a team.

            @Badwolf: But in almost every other case it's either not related to flying,  or if it is,  she's leading the charge.  It's hard to imagine her being part of a flight team without trying to show off and grab the spotlight.
<p></p>@Ginger: You'd be surprised at how hard it can be to tell them apart; when somebody is naturally good at something they usually spend all there time on it and end up having tons of experience anyway.

            @bad:  What other occasions was she flying as part of a team?  The one that comes to mind for me is Hurricane Fluttershy,  and she was the leader in that.  Also,  that wasn't a performance,  so she wasn't tempted to show off.
