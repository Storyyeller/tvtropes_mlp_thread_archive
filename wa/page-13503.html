            <div class="quoteblock"> Anyway,  I'd tend to put Shining Armor's age around maybe 30-ish. Which is a bit young to run the military,  but it probably works a bit differently in Equestria. </div>
<p></p>In US military,  if you go through Officer Candidate School,  you could be a Lieutenant (leader of a platoon) in as young as 21. Of course,  that is assuming that Royal Guards work like that; considering that captain is effectively US Army equivalent of a General and that it seems to based more on British rank system,  who knows how the translation works or not.

            Shining is pretty obviously a higher rank than that.
<p></p>And yeah,  overall good episode,  not one of the best,  but on the positive side of the spectrum.  I think that it was a bit contrived that noone ever realized that something was up,  but other than that it was pretty solid.

            Well Equestria seems to be a rather heavy meritocracy. So easy to move up to high ranks just by being competent.

            Shining might have had a leg up thanks to family connections.  His sister is the princesses student after all,  and even before that they knew Cadance.  So as long as he's actually competent,  a quick rise through the ranks isn't surprising.

            In US Army,  you can actually reasonably make a Captain at 26,  possibly even younger at like 23~25 if you have been particularly overachieving.
<p></p>Again,  obviously RG would most likely doesn't work that way and Shining is obviously way higher than that.
<p></p>I am wondering if RG is the only armed forces in Equestria,  but eh,  been there,  asked that.

            @Seraphem: Yeah,  but even before that you had seven ponies,  none of whom ever realized that anything was wrong.  You'd think the fact that the "games inspector" <em>never mentioned the games</em> would be a bit of a problem.  That and you'd think the chicken pony would be a little bit suspicious when she inexplicably gets a full welcome and a meet and greet with the princess as soon as she hops off the train.  It's like if you decided to go to England for vacation and as soon as you hopped off the plane a limo driver appears to take you to meet the queen.
<p></p>@D Roy: Around here,  no. Elsewhere... probably,  I have no idea because I don't really get out much.  Derpibooru had the usual complaints but I don't think it was any worse than the alicorn controversy.

            <em>Probably the case considering that Equestria doesn't have any political enemies or any other reason to form an army (and that any threat could be neutralized by a Rainbow to the face by 6 certain little ponies) an army and maybe even police may be redundant.</em>

            7? It was only 5 of them. The mistaken pony didn't seem the brightest,  and was just going along. The rest,  I'd blame on RD telling them everything was a test. Not giving them time to stop and think.
<p></p>Yeah it was a bit contrived,  but it was fun,  and entertaining.

            @dRoy: Nah,  the royal guard is mostly ceremonial. they have some combat training,  but only the top members are actually trained by the actual military,  the Vigil and Vanguard castes. They just don't tend to be seen much because Celestia prefers to keep the citizens out of international politics as much as possible.

            Well,  at best,  there's the leaked version of the (incomplete) game. If it's still in circulation. They can't blame Mane6 if <em>that</em> gets passed around.

<p></p>I am going with that guess for the moment,  mostly because we haven't seen any other armed forces. Should I consider Wonderbolts as one...eh......

            @Blue: Only one developer quit; the other one had been off the team for months and EQD reported it wrong.
<p></p>Also,  given that the Royal Guard seems to comprise the majority of Equestria's military power,  being the head of it must mean he's pretty high up in the ranks,  especially given that he's head of the force in the capital city.  And while the Royal Guard might be largely ceremonial,  it doesn't mean they aren't trained soldiers.  In Real Life,  most ceremonial soldiers are still fully trained,  even if the costumes look ridiculous.  He might not be the head of the whole thing,  but the part he does lead is probably comprised of real soldiers.
<p></p>The other thing is that being the head of the Royal Guard implies that the royalty themselves trust him implicitly. He's basically the equivalent of White House security.
