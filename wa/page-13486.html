            And damn it,  we all knew a day would come when Hasbro would stop being so easy going with the fandom. They've got a copyright to protect and thus far we've had it very easy as far as permission of fanworks goes. Some bronies will inevitably quit after this announcement,  but I at least I'll continue to be as supportive as ever. Yeah it sucks,  but did everypony think it would last forever?

<p></p>Mane6 were taking themselves professionally and presenting their game constantly at cons and such. They had a website,  company name,  and everything. They were essentially an indie game developer making an unlicensed game.
<p></p>Also,  Hasbro is of course not a single being but a company. I'm pretty sure the head of Hasbro Studios loves the brony fandom,  but I'm also sure there are <em>some</em> people at Hasbro that are still like "WTF?" in regards to bronies (and maybe even the Transformers &amp; GI Joe fandoms,  we're probably not alone in any of this).

            I hope they take Lauren up on her offer. With the quality they put out,  and the publicity surrounding all this,  any game they make will be <em>big</em>. It'll be something they can add to their portfolios that no potential employer could overlook if they want to pursue a career in game design. It could also be the impetus to found an actual game company of their own. This whole fiasco could quite literally be the best thing that ever happened for them if everyone plays their cards right.

            The thing is,  its not like they can just sub out the ponies for Lauren's new characters.  There would be a lot of work involved in getting new movesets,  balancing them,  and the crew is probably a bit disappointed at the moment.

            Aww man,  <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a> got C&amp;Ded? That was probably the most promising and anticipated project in the fandom,  and it was nearly done too.
<p></p>I think they could legally release it by changing all the names and recoloring the characters,  but they probably won't do that now.

            @ Crowlover: That's most definitely true. But not all is lost. There's a whole lot of underlying code that they can re-use if they want to make a new game,  and they've already proven they're dedicated. I think they're smart enough to realize the opportunity this presents too. The only real questions in my mind are if they're too bitter to grab it,  and if the characters Lauren would provide are interesting in their own right.

            Regardless of what they do,  if they want to make another game they have to start over from the ground up (unless they plan on using 4 legged characters).
<p></p>Anyways,  its late,  and I don't want to leave on a bad note,  so have some Scootaloo music. See ya tomorrow with the episode!

            @ Darkabomination: I think we will. We've proven time and again that we're willing to weather controversy without too much lasting bad blood,  and that one tweet from Lauren probably cut the shitstorm in half.

            Not to sound snobby,  but not a lot of people are as rational as us lot in here.  Could be nasty as I said.  But these things can be surprisingly easy to pacify.
