            @Arha: oh god,  this conversation.
<p></p>It's a strange issue,  Arha. On the one hand they're treated extremely well,  and it's because they generally have one purpose that the ponies like. It's a sort of symbiotic relationship,  and could be referred to at worst as indentured servitude.
<p></p>On the other hand they are fully sapient,  and the apples don't really ask their opinions in spite of this. they have a fairly clearly lower position in society. They aren't treated as equals,  but they aren't treated <em>poorly</em>. I think by this point it's institutionalized - no one does it out of malice,  it's simply how it's done. I doubt AJ would mind if a sheep decided they wanted to leave,  for example.
<p></p>I had an idea once for a fanfiction wherein a sheep decided he wants to be treated as equal to a pony,  and decides to go and get a job and a house and such. However,  the idea hasn't exactly been well recieved. genreally people don't seem to want to read about it. I think it's an interesting idea,  though.

            Weren't the Ood genetically engineered to like serving people and enjoy helping out? Kind of like the cattle from Hitchhickers Guide that insisted you eat them because they were made to derive pleasure from being eaten?

            Ginger,  the bleeding hell is wrong with you? That episode was prime Donna and how can you possibly say that? Who <em>wants</em> to be enslaved? I can imagine a species being friendly or subservient,  maybe habitually helpful but you can't conclude what was happening to the Ood was a-okay.

            But if you take how they work into account,  it still doesn't really work out. they're not a subservient race,  they're a symbiotic race. They live with their personalities in their hands,  so they need protection,  or to be friendly. Is it possible they enjoy being subservient? Perhaps. But slavery is different than subservience. The Ood are species-wide telepathic. Can you imagine the benefits from working with such a species? Developing symbiosis with them would be extraordinarily useful. Instead,  the human empire removed their prime ability and mentally castrated them. Happiness in slavery or not,  that's just not kosher.
<p></p>I've seen happiness in slavery done well. The atans from the ellenium were a race of slaves because it kept them from murdering each other - their masters decreed who they could and could not kill,  while their culture was so proud they would kill over such offenses as <em>someone's shadow touching them</em>. That's a good example of happiness in slavery. What was done to the Ood was not.
