            I really liked the newest episode,  mostly due to the slapstick generated by Fluttershy becoming such a jerk!  XD  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">But only to everyone else,  not Rarity and Pinkie Pie.  THAT was saddening</a>.  I also found Iron Will to be AWESOME!  Plus the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he actually backed down as soon as Fluttershy explained herself and calmly left instead of going into some villainous rant</span> only added some more bonus points for me about the character.  Shows that he's really a hammy business person selling a product who <em>happens</em> to look like and probably CAN beat you to a bloody pulp instead of an outright bully.
<p></p>My complaints about it was the sheer number of jerks that cropped up at the beginning of the episode was too obvious a plot device for me (was the haggling of a single cheery THAT freakin' necessary?!?),  as was Fluttershy's sudden escalation in jerkass.  The way she handled herself at the end though was <em>truly</em> a grand character defining moment but the ending only concentrated on how this character development applied to her animal charges.  I wished they had more time to expand that on the actual Ponyville citizenry.
<p></p>Overall,  this episode does have its glaring problems,  but the sum of its parts do manage to save it.  If a better writer was at the helm,  this would have been a truly AWESOME episode instead of just a good one.  Plus I really hope to see Iron Will again.  I'm already imagining what would be the end result of a partnership him,  a minotaur that's an honest businessman,  and those with far less scruples.  Like the Flim Flams.......

            I don't think its so much anger repression as that Fluttershy just doesn't get angry very often.  She's normally so docile that when she <em>does</em> get angry she doesn't know how to deal with it. (See: Flutterrage)  Iron Will's advice was basically "allow yourself to get angry more when people mess with you",  but since she rarely gets angry,  she has no idea how she's supposed to act and goes totally overboard.
<p></p>Most of the times in the show when Fluttershy gets really mad it's directed at someone or something that merits the response,  so it doesn't seem as extreme.

            I think Fluttershy needed to understand how to show anger. If you keep anger bottled up without releasing it in some meaningful and/or controlled way,  people eventually snap. I think this is what happened to Fluttershy in this episode...
