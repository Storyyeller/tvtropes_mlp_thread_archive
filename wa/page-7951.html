            Fancypants seems too chill to butt heads with anypony.
<p></p>Regarding the celebrity thing,  I thought the idea was that Trixie started the talent show herself,  which is how she snagged a judge's chair in spite of her lack of fame.

            If there's one thing Trixie is good at,  it's showmareship.  She could give a really good pitch that convinces the other judges to support the show.

            A traveling show is good.  I was just figuring it would be based in Canterlot,  but this way they can pick up the best contestants from the various places they stop.

            Then for the final show (Say the top 5 acts face off) they bring in Celestia,  Luna,  and Cadance as the guest judges.
<p></p>actauly I was thinking Fancypants,  Soarin,  and Saphire Shores,  with Trixie as the host.

            Probably.  The question is if that would happen.  For one thing,  it's a traveling show,  so until the finals in Canterlot it would be hard for any particular contestant to get universally popular.  Also,  people love Simon dissing on the bad performances in real life,  so Trixie could actually become very popular if she's entertaining enough.

            @Seraph again,  the problem is that none of those judges would be mean enough. They can't give good criticism,  they'd be boring.
<p></p>and as Apple said,  the winner should get to perform for Celestia (like the winner over here does for the queen

            @Crow true. I wonder if Trixie's aware of that.
<p></p>If so,  then that's an ingeniously roundabout way to make herself famous,  isn't it. She gets CELEBRATED for demeaning ponies
