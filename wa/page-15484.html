            No,  they just edited the name out completely.  She isn't referred to by name in the new version.  She just says "Careful" instead of "Careful,  Derpy"

            How did I become a fan?  Well,  I've been a fan of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a> in general since I was at least 4 years old.  However,  I was a little reluctant at first to try out the new show because I was afraid it would be anti-intellectual and say that it's bad to be smart and studious because I read the plot summary of "Twilight is a studious,  aloof unicorn who is told to stop studying so much and go make friends" but thankfully it never really went down the path I feared it would (Twlight's trait of being smart and studious isn't treated as a negative trait of hers most of the time and is often what helps her solve problems,  like when she taught Pinkie how to analyze clues in the mystery train story).  I also was wary of the idea that they made the "princess of the night" be the one who turns evil,  but I read the spoilers (I'm a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerHound" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerHound">Spoiler Hound</a>) and was reassured that Luna gets turned good again at the end of the pilot.  It also helped that I got curious by reading some of the episode summaries on this site.  The first episode I watched was Applebuck Season,  and that's what got me into the show because the scene where Applejack and Pinkie make the baked bads reminded me of the kind of silly "characters mess up at cooking" stories I used to make up when I was younger.
<p></p>I think I started watching the show between the first and second seasons,  so the second season was the first one I watched as it aired.

            At this point everyone who works on the show or makes merch seems to be referring to her as Derpy,  even if they won't actually label her as such in an official capacity.  So that name seems to have won.

            As to The Doctor. The only reason he isn't Doctor Whooves is the BBC just LOVES suing people. But general consensus,  is Doctor Whooves is his real name,  Time Turner is just his pony version of John Smith. The name he gives when he needs to give one.

            Am I the only one here who doesn't really like Doctor Whooves? I like Doctor Who,  I just don't think he fits very well in Equestria. I'll admit to being bias though,  as I'm not much of a fan of the new series of DW,  and that's where that incarnation seems to be inspired from.

            @Dark: That's pretty much my view as well. I have nothing against Doctor Who,  but the character type just sticks out like a sore thumb in the MLP setting.  And it doesn't help that 95% of his "characterization" is just borrowed from DW,  which means that as a person who hasn't watched DW,  I have no frame of reference for it.  The character is just an amalgamation of DW references rather than a standalone character like Derpy or Lyra are.

            Personally I don't mind either name but really it's just a name it doesn't matter in the long run. And anyhow there's plenty of other things to worry about anyway. Debating on whether to see Party of One after Owl's Well that Ends Well.

            I'm pretty meh about Whooves/Hooves too. Granted,  I'm not a fan of Dr. Who. I am curious about the show,  but it's not really on my list of priorities. It's also worth noting that I don't have a favourite background pony at all (and I'm very luke-warm about the majority of the common fanon thrown around for fan-favourites),  so there may be some bias there too.

            @J Teeth:  There really isn't.  It's not like you need to watch all fifty years,  just start with one of the newer doctors.  I've only seen a handful of older episodes myself.

            I'd actually say watch a classic episode. They're more stand-alone than the new series which is more like an arc-based drama pretending to be a serial-based show.
<p></p>For a place to start,  I'd suggest Tomb of the Cybermen or the Time-Meddler.

            @Crow: True,  but I'd still want to get a good handle on all the aspects of it,  and even then it's a lot to watch.  Even if I don't watch all the episodes I'd want to be at least familiar with the jokes and stuff from previous seasons.
