            He does. But knowing Dany she'll be opposed to it for some reason. So she'll need to be convinced,  or dragged back kicking and screaming. Plus she's really,  really,  really far from everything so they need to get there first.

            Ginger,  I see you use the word "aesthetic" a lot in reference to a character. What exactly do you mean by that? (I get the impression that you maybe don't mean what the character looks like physically?)
