            @ginger Zuko's tactics always seemed the most interesting to me,  since he usually goes with fire daggers instead of the standard "burn everything" move. Firebending gets really cool in Seasons 2 and 3.

            Lack of variety,  I suppose. Still,  I like fire too much to complain about that.
<p></p>Waterbending seemed the most versatile to me even though I'm not really a water fan in general for most sttings,  but in Avatar,  it seemed the most useful element.
<p></p>EDIT: Ninja'd. And I'd disagree that Zhao never did anything interesting.

            I actually have a copy of The Last Airbender with Rifftrax commentary on my computer. Still haven't gotten around to watching it.
<p></p>The Avatar is always reincarnated in the same cycle. Air -&gt; Water -&gt; Earth -&gt; Fire -&gt; Air -&gt; Water. Etc. This is also the order the Avatar learns the four bending skills starting with the one belonging to the nation they were born in. Korra is of the Water Tribe so she started with Water and learned air last. This is also how the seasons work as one element is assoicated with each season. Winter (Water) -&gt; Spring (Earth) -&gt; Summer (Fire) -&gt; Autumn (Air)
<p></p>Bitter work also goes into a great deal of detail showing that Airbending and Earthbending are very,  very different especially in regards to ones mental state when doing that sort of bending. Airbending is about freedom and quick movements and being light on your feet. Earthbending is about being stubborn as hell. Presumably Waterbending and Firebending have the same dicotomy. I'd gues Firebending is fueled by passion (of one form or another) while waterbending is fueled by calmness and "going with the flow."
<p></p>Basically there is an insane amount of world building in the Avatar universe is what I'm saying.

            It's made clear later on that firebenders <em>aren't</em> the bad guys. <em>Some</em> firebenders are the bad guys and they happen to be in charge.
