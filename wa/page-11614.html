            I have no comics to give,  alas,  but here's a joke I thought might MAKE for a good comic eventually.
<p></p>Great Moments in technology: the telephone!
<p></p>Invented by Alexander Gaham Bull,  the telephonic communication device,  or 'telephone' for short,  was poised to take the world by storm! No longer would we have to rely on pegasi couriers and mail to relay information,  we would be able to directly communicate with another pony. anywhere in the world! With faster communication technology would spring ahead in leaps and strides!
<p></p>The device was devilishly simple - little more than a can on a string,  really. A really,  really long string! The user would speak into one end of the device,  and that sound would travel down the line to come out of the receiving end's ear piece,  and vice versa! The user would be able to talk and listen at the same time! Or at least,  talk and pretend to listen.
<p></p>The device had merely one enemy: The design for the dial. You see the device relied on a dial in order to choose which other telephone it would go to! At first Bull tried to use a rotary dial,  which required ponies to spin a wheel to a specific set of numbers. Alas,  our hooves were too big to work the dial. So he tried buttons! but our hooves were too big for those too.
<p></p>With costs mounting due to failed prototypes - and a strange rash of pegasi in rubber suits repeatedly crashing into the test lines - Bull was forced to give up on his invention,  and the communication revolution he had so desperately wished to start.

            @ Mousa
<p></p>Alright,  here's what I got:
<p></p>Years ago,  a group of six colts meet in a boarding school.  They soon became close friends,  being misfits of various degrees.  Then,  they discovered that a great and famous explorer and treasure hunter was a past pupil at their school,  and that he left an important treasure secured near the school.  They go and look for this treasure.  It's a difficult and dangerous adventure,  but they do it.  And in the course of this adventure,  their talents and calling in life comes to the fold.  They all earn their <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMs">C Ms</a> that night.
<p></p>Flash forward to the present time,  and the leader of said group,  now an 'adventurous hippie pony' who's all but turned his back on his privileged upbringing,  is trying to rally his old friends once more,  as he has discovered the location of where that famous hero of his went missing,  and he wants to find out what happened to him.  As does a crew of Griffon Privateers and Hog Pirates.  The race is on...
<p></p>...and,  that's pretty much it. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>Where do I go from here?

            Okay,  this is where you go,  you start from the beginning,  well one of the beginnings,  you either start with the cutie mark story or you reveal that through flashbacks and start with the Hippie going on his journey to find his friends.
<p></p>He's sounds rich and a bit naive so I say you start of that story with him finding out about some sort of rumor or map or information about this missing adventurer.
<p></p>He sees this as an excellent useo f his time but knows he needs friends,  a crew,  and he hears about the closest one through some m means,  he he goes on a breif short range journey to convince this friend of this plan. I'm not sure how,  maybe thsi friend is in jail,  or some other dangerous situation,  it something that'll shwocase both of their abilities in intellect and combat.
<p></p>Next this lad will return home,  he is of higher class,  yes? Well then while he is defiant of this backing,  I'm sure his much smarter fiend will be able to let him know they can take advantage of this to get supplies like say ship or something. At first the fmaily should adamantly opposed to it,  so our heroes will "borrow" the bits in the middle of the night,  and take flight,  becoming outlaws in their own home while they follow this lead.
<p></p>at their first stop,  they should be looking for rumors on two things "Information on their adventurer" and "Information on one of their old friends". One may lead into another,  but I think it oculd be spun into a kidnapping story involving one of the rival pirate gangs also looking for this adventurer.
<p></p>Our heroes help retrieve their friend and get their information and move on,  you try the three-colt dynamic for a bit,  maybe while they go to one of the rumored last locations of the Adventurer,  maybe a lost island or a tomb where they have to go through Indiana Jones-like escapades only to find a piece of map or some clue that shows the adventurer was there,  left his mark,  and has moved on to bigger and better things.
<p></p>You sort of repeat the patterns  little bit with a bit more intrigue,  like they find themselves in a land where they're unwanted,  one of their friends is against them at first,  they encounter another rival pirate crew,  perhaps trouble with the law,  I'm thinking several false leads and the mean characters getting tricked occasionally by cons trying to separate the fools from their money in exchange for fake information.
<p></p>All the while developing the crew and their various traits and quirks in the wide variety of scenarios while following the elusive trial of this adventurer and each clue they find seems to be part of some larger whole,  who knows,  maybe a grand treasure,  maybe a superweapon,  maybe a lost world,  maybe a new alcorn,  it's up to you.

<p></p>The captain's skill is 'being adventurous' (vague I know).  So,  I was thinking that he's good not just with ponies,  but animals too.  This sound OK?
