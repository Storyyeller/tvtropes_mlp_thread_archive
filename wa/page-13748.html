            I don't think she was deceptive. I think it was just that once Rainbow Dash saw how she was treating her other friends then she didn't think having her as a friend was worth it anymore.

            LD being the element of Loyalty makes roughly as much sense as Blueblood being the element of Generosity. She repeatedly demonstrated a severe lack of concern for anypony else,  her 'friend' included,  and was only interested in furthering her own goals. Ambition doesn't necessarily preclude loyalty,  but loyal she was not.
<p></p>Actually as far as that goes,  Gilda would make a <em>very</em> good element of Loyalty. She was still a bit selfish about their friendship,  sure,  but more in a possessive way - she obviously still cared for Dash a lot considering what she was willing to 'put up with' for her.

<p></p>As for Gilda,  Lightning Dust,  and the like,  there would need to be some definite development on all of their parts before we could really go assigning Elements.

            Could actually make for an interesting story - all the minor antagonists find themselves in possession of the elements,  but only for potential - they have to grow into the roles first.

<p></p>Can't be Tixie,  Lightning Dust or Blueblood because reasons.
<p></p>I <em>did</em> consider making Gilda Loyalty,  but Loyalty's takn. I wouldn't normally be averse to moving him to something else,  but Loyalty fits his arc quite nicely.
<p></p>Also,  two related questions:
<p></p>Firstly: How would pre-Ponyville Iron Will react to losing <em>all</em> his current customers?
<p></p>Secondly: Mules are portrayed as part-Equestrian rather than part-Saddle Arabian,  right? So my question is,  and it's a strange but serious one,  so I want you to think about it carefully,  if Discord's head went missing,  would mules turn into donkeys?

            Are you talking about the "ponies and pony related things disappear" idea?

            @Perpetual Lurker; Yes,  but the ponies aren't <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">Ret Gone</a>. Just gone. Everyone else remembers them and stuff they built or wrote or whatever is still there (unless it includes the word "pony" or an image of a pony or something like that).
<p></p>EDIT: As for Iron Will,  that's a good point,  so:
<p></p>Iron Will: Iron Will's the name and training <em>was</em> my game,  but now they're all gone so now training other things is my game!

            @ CDRW actaully a lot of them managed to get the bill taken care of. The people at the con,  and across the fandom joined forces to help them out and end the con right. Well or at least in less a clusterfuck then it would have been.
<p></p>And all the VA's and what not seem to be taking it in stride,  not put off from cons or anything since they know this was an exception. Though one or two did say they would be a little leary about attending first year cons without more details now.

<p></p>I currently have Zecora as magic. For Spike,  I considered Magic and Generosity,  but currently have him as Loyalty as the fic is about him wanting to get the ponies he loves back.

<p></p>These don't work for this story as they're missing.
<p></p>EDIT: @Perpetual Lurker: Makes sense. I really want Discord's head missing,  but I suppose that chimerae could work differently from hybrids.

            I don't think Dash was fooled by Gilda.
<p></p>I think Dash just grew up a bit after becoming a bearer and making friends with a variety of ponies.  Gilda may not have changed much since flight school but Dash apparently did.

            I don't think Gilda was deceptive; her and Dash were just never in a situation where Gilda had to compete with RD's other friends for attention.  She was always possessive,  it's just that this was the first time RD didn't just roll with it.

<p></p>EDIT: @Lopiny: In addition to the Unicon issues,  we're currently discussing some stuff rekated to a fanfic idea I had. Currently about non-pony element-bearers.
<p></p>Speaking of which Perpetual Lurker has convinced me that Iron Will will unfortunately not work,  but I <em>could</em> get one of his goats.
