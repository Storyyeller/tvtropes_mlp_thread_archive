            Time for another fanfic report!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Dear Thread Manor...
<p></p>You're probably wondering about another fanfic report so soon after the last one. Well,  after ace recommended project sunflower,  it was such a good story that I went on a reading binge! a human in equestria reading binge! and that's what all of these stories are,  human in equestria stories! Lets get started with the story that set this whole thing in motion!
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/5170/Project%3A-Sunflower">Project: Sunflower<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. In the near future,  Earth is under siege,  and losing. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo">An alien swarm of nanomachines</a> crashed landed on Earth,  and has been slowly but inexorably spreading,  devouring everything in its wake. Earth has about 5 years left. Fortunately,  there is hope. Project Harmonics has created ways to look into,  and occasionally travel to,  other realities in the hopes of finding a new world for humanity to move to. And they've finally found one. Only problem is,  it's already inhabited,  by colorful ponies of all things. A brave young woman volunteers to travel to this strange new world in the form of a pony to gather information on it to help ensure peaceful first contact. Because while everyone involved wishes for things to proceed in a diplomatic manner,  humanity is definitely going to be moving through,  whether the ponies want them to or not...
<p></p>Wow! what a great story this was! It's definitely up there in my top 5! The only problem with it is the author seems to have never heard of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail">The Law of Conservation of Detail</a>. So many thing that get brought up only to never appear again,  or to appear in completely inconsequential roles! However,  it all just helps make the world that more developed,  so I'm not complaining! It's over 200k words though,  so prepare yourselves for the long haul!

<p></p>Side stories to Project: Sunflower! Not much more to say.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/45907/Mission%3A-Improbable">Mission: Improbable<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Spy</a> has been stuck in Equestria ever since an incident involving one of Engi's teleporters and an ill timed ubercharge. Between his disguises and cloak,  he's managed to avoid detection so far,  even with paranoia running high after the recent failed changeling invasion. But however is he going to get back home? and what's this about a follow up changeling invasion attempt?
<p></p>This is a fun little story that,  like anything involving <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TF2" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TF2">TF 2</a>,  doesn't take itself very seriously. at only 20k words,  there's not much reason not to give it a try!

Commander Martin Alexandra has been dispatched to one such world,  this one severely ravaged by the green crystal,  with 70% of the surface covered in Tiberium. They are surprised to find the planet has natives,  strange equine aliens that seem somewhat resistant to the effects of Tiberium. These aren't the first alien life forms encountered by humanity of course,  but this is the first time the aliens species hadn't already been devastated to the point of near extinction by Tiberium. It is their duty to assist these equine aliens however they can,  reclaim this world from the Tiberium,  and defeat the Scrin forces that will no doubt be appearing very soon.
<p></p>This one's pretty good story,  especially if you've played the C&amp;C games before.

RD is obsessed with breaking her own speed records,  which is currently at rainboom 4,  but it's simply beyond her physical ability to go past that,  so she goes to Twi for a little magical assistance. Against the librarians wishes,  RD reaches rainboom 10,  but when she does,  something goes horribly wrong... <br>Scientist at the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva,  Switzerland get a rude surprise when an small but unexplained explosion interrupts an experiment. When an engineer enters the tunnels to investigate,  he makes a very strange discovery...
<p></p>This is an interesting story,  it's all sciencey! and how often is RD the lone pony in a story? It's usually Twi who gets into situations like this!

Discord,  in an attempt to teach Celestia a lesson about Chaos,  sends her to Earth in the body of a human female who's a dentist in the US Navy. With over a 1000 years experience backing her up,  Celestia manages to keep her cool and sets out to learn what she can about this strange world and those who live on it,  as well as find a way back home.
<p></p>ok,  so they aren't all human in equestria stories,  this one's a pony on Earth story! Now that I think about it,  so was the one above! Tia gives us a neat perspective on this kind of plot,  and at just over 25k words,  it's definitely worth the read.

Twilight wakes up to find herself on a strange island that clearly isn't apart of Equestria. She meets Lieutenant Commander Marshall Bailey,  another castaway on this island,  who's been here for 5 years. He's done a lot of things to try and escape this island in that time,  but none of it has worked. But now,  with unicorn magic added into the mix,  maybe,  together,  they can find a way off this strange,  impossible island,  and find out how they got here in the first place...
<p></p>This one's a neat story,  it's not often you see Twi going <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a> with someone.

A colony shape carrying billions of humans on it's way to a new planet takes a hit from an asteroid and is sucked into a black hole. It somehow comes out the other side,  heavily damage but still somewhat functional. The sole survivor on the ship,  Magnus,  finds himself transformed into a horse with wings and a horn and completely immortal,  with only the ships AI to keep him company. Now,  six thousand years of drifting through space later,  Magnus is more than a little insane. The ship is now approaching a habitable planet,  a planet inhabited by ponies of all things. but the only thing Magnus cares about is,  do they have cake?
<p></p>This one's primarily a comedy. a pretty unique premise,  if you ask me.
<p></p>Wow,  that was a lot of stories! I think that was my longest fanfic report yet! Until next time!
