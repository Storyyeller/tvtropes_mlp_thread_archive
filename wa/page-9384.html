            It's why I can't stand it when heroes display excessive amounts of confidence.
<p></p>For example,  Blackjack (a character I REALLY like) in Project Horizons takes out an entire village worth of people singlehandedly and in the end she screams at the survivors "You! Can't! Kill! Me!"
<p></p>At that moment I just wanted someone to blow her fucking skull off

            @ Kegi: But not in those circumstances. You can't be exact with Rainbow's dream and vague about the others.
<p></p>Actually they were unconscious. So they didn't see it. And Rainbow messed up the rest of her presentation that they did see. Ergo,  it would not be unreasonable that they'd have different reactions to a perfect presentation that they were concious for.
<p></p>Now you're being vague with Rainbow and specific with Rarity. Rarity has specifically stopped trying to marry for status,  she has not stopped trying to acquire status.
<p></p>Possibly,  the point remains that they risked life and limb to become Rainbow's pet.

            @Waz: <em>I</em> don't. I was asked who had the bigger ego,  I wanswered. I'm not saying it;s a bad thing,  just that Dash has one.
<p></p>@Bad: Dash's dream was non-situational. It wasn't a matter of 'at the gala',  it was anywhere they might have shown up. By that same measure,  why should I apply a rubric to them I can't apply to Dash?
<p></p>And the wonderbolts were still fully aware that she saved them - they knew <em>she</em> did something that <em>they</em> couldn't. Flash or no,  that in and of itself is pretty impressive.
<p></p>Rarity remains trying to acquire status,  but she has tried a different method because it has been made clear to her that her first method <em>does not work</em>. She's now trying to <em>earn</em> her upper-crust lifestyle. Dash,  meanwhile,  is <em>still</em> trying to be impressive as her fallback.

            True humility is very rare. It's something that I'm still trying to learn myself. It's far too easy for me to become proud.

            @ Kegi: It was specifically at the Gala. Note that she didn't fly out during Sonic Rainboom as soon as they arrived. She did not plan to do tricks instead of a hurricane in order to be accepted into the Wonderbolts. The only time she planned that is specifically at the Gala. Just like everyone else's dreams.
<p></p>But they didn't see it. What they saw was her failing. They couldn't accept her after a massively flawed routine and everyone else saying that she pulled it all together at the end.
<p></p>So instead of training to be part of the Wonderbolts,  she should do what? Should she turn to illicit methods rather than honest ones?

            She did. Ticket Master and At The Gala both show it.
<p></p>Note however she didn't act on it. Unlike everybody else. She settled for less. Learning the lesson before everyone else.

            How about,  I don't know,  going to an actual tryout instead of just trying to be flashy whenever they're around? Figure out how they <em>normally</em> pull their members and go through that? The point is she isn't trying to get <em>accepted</em> by training,  she's training so she can impress them and get accepted through that. It may seem like splitting hairs,  but it's an important difference.
<p></p>@Bad: Alright,  fair enough. But AJ and Twilight still have evidence that supports their theories,  they've still succeeded at their dreams in another context. Dash had <em>never</em> impressed the wonderbolts in any context,  particularly not as,  if you are saying,  they only ever saw her fail.
