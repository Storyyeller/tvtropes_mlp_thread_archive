            @Pannic:  Well then it sounds like your fic could use some improvements.  It isn't a proper fanfic if it doesn't incite ginger rage at some point.

            @Ginger: Fanfics are usually written primarily for the author as they aren't getting money out of it,  so if he wants to write Pinkie that way,  he'll do so,  even if everyone else didn't like it.
<p></p>@crowlover: Star Swirl would probably be rather embarassed. She's pretty naive and doesn't really have romantic experience. Plus her admiration of Twilight borders on sexual,  even though she prefers stallions in general.

            Traumatized Pinkie was great. I actually felt sorry for her a little bit. but then not only did she get better,  but it's revealed that ME finding her funny is what gives her power. What kind of slap in the face is that.
<p></p>The 4th wall shit. ENOUGH WITH IT!! It's driving me crazy. I think I broke one of my teeth during chapter 16,  I'm not sure. I heard a loud crunch that's for sure

            Ginger,  just because someone finds Pinkie amusing does NOT give you the right to bite there head off,  yes we know you don't like her,  but many people due. No there is NOTHING wrong with not sharing the opinion of the majority,  at all. and as you should know by now <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourAreNotAlone" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourAreNotAlone">Your Are Not Alone</a>,  we're all your friends,  and just because we disagree with what you find entertaining doesn't mean we stop liking you or are out to get you.
<p></p>Pinkie is written over the top so much because that is what a large amount of people like and find funny. Not to personally spite you. Can it get grating at times,  yes. Does it give you the right to snap at people who like it? no! Does it mean it's wrong not to find that funny,  no. You have to stop taking everything so personally,  and stop acting like no one understands you. We <em>understand</em>,  we don't <em>agree</em>. there's a difference.

            So,  what's Pinkie doing that's got ginger upset now?  <strike>sleeping with other men?</strike> (just teasin',  ging.)
<p></p>Speaking of which,  I tried to introduce one of my friends to MLP yesterday.  I don't think it took... and the guy is a Pinkie-hater too (the episode was "The Last Roundup, " and at around the time Pinkie was doing her picklebarrel-kumquat routine,  dude said "I think I know why Applejack left.")
<p></p>And... who wants to see a video of me beating <em>Contra</em>,  twice in a row?

            @ginger I have noticed that even after she became cheerful again,  the fear of losing her friends is still definitely there. It's actually kind of nice to have that layer of personality added to Pinkie.

            Weaponized Pinkie was one of two times that I did not like her antics. The other time was AAAAH! NIGHTMARE MOON!

            Eh.  Pinkie was okay back when she wasn't quite as over-the-top as she is nowadays and the world didn't freaking cater to her.
<p></p>Compare how Twilight reacts to her at the beginning of "Griffon the Brush-Off" to how almost the entire world reacts to her in "It's About Time" or "A Friend In Deed" for example...
<p></p>Course,  Ginger always hated Pinkie,  whereas I only started disliking her when she became more one-dimensional.

            @ Ed,  they've just gotten used to her.
<p></p>She's still no where near one-dimensional. Tough yes they due tend to not give her enough non-joke screen time,  but that's more a failling in Season 2 of not having enough ensamble stuff.
