<p></p>I've always wanted to do a long sarcastic answer for that. Bonus points if someone can say this all with a perfectly straight face.
<p></p>Well your first question brings up interesting issues regarding identity,  but I think your question can best be answered by saying that I am the one you know as Badwolfwho,  or will know at least. As for what I have done with my past self,  I temporarily locked myself in the basement so that I could take the place of my past self and try to prevent the disaster than I traveled back in time to prevent. However,  I didn't want to tell anyone else since doing so tends to have adverse effects in time travel scenarios,  but it looks like you have discovered my secret anyway.

            Ah,  well,  I can safely say that I honestly <em>haven't</em> seen it outside the original cartoon. Though,  that short gets played a <em>lot</em> whenever they're shown at all,  so I can kinda get the overexposure to an extent. It's still not an reference that is made that often.

            I like Rarity. I didn't think I would,  but I did and I do. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">
<p></p>That scene in "Sonic Rainboom" where Rarity goes high up in the sky and shines beautiful colours through her butterfly wings with the sun was impressive...even if she flew too close to the sun and burned out her wings,  causing to have a big fall! Was I the only one who looked at that scene and was reminded of the Greek myth Icarus? That plotline with Rarity seemed to have a number of similarities to the Icarus myth. Hmm....

            Hi folks!
<p></p>Just got out of work there.  Hectic day that ended with me having to confront 50 drunken kids and man handle their two ring leaders off the forecourt.  Urgh.
<p></p>Anyway,  what's going on here?

            Watched Over a Barrel. Applelousa wasn't nearly as amusing a Fillydelphia. But hey,  we got a change in scenery from Ponyville at least!
<p></p>A train  pulled by ponies? but...that makes the locomotive entirely unnecessary!
<p></p>Really pinkie? Dressing up like a show girl and doing a can-can routine? Definitely something the children watching the show wouldn't be able to appreciate...
<p></p>ha! The old "anvil in a haystack" trick! Well played!
<p></p>Kinda disappointed that they brushed off the whole expanding into others territory thing with a simple Sharing is Caring aesop,  but I guess going any farther than that woulda been a bit too deep for a children's show,  so its understandable.

<p></p>I certainly apreciated the show girl routine. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_wink.png" height="16" width="16" alt="wink" title="wink">
<p></p>Anyway,  did you like the episode overall?  OAB is quite controversial within Bronydom.
