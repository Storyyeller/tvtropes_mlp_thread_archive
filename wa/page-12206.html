<p></p>To be fair,  Ginger's pretty bad at predicting his own likes too. Which is especially problematic given his reluctance to try new things. Anyway,  I'm surprised he didn't mention Applejack's skills helping out as a plus

            In spite of his claim to having a set of rules,  Ginger's preferences are essentially arbitrary. Hell,  I'm half-convinced that he deliberately subverts peoples expectations so that he can sigh and complain about how no one gets him.
<p></p>I mean,  I don't mean to sound bitter about it,  or even as though I'm complaining. It's just a tad frustrating how he can't ever seem to NOT take the opportunity to point out how nobody shares his preferences.

            Well,  I finally watched the episode and decided to record my thoughts as I watched it:
<p></p>Wow,  did the animation get better
<p></p>Poor blue jay
<p></p>Is it me,  or was the Clone Pinkie's smile kind of weird looking?
<p></p>How many people thought "the fun has been doubled" when Pinkie said she was going to double her fun?
<p></p>RD's reading the same book of Daring Do again?
<p></p>Wait,  did they not put in RD's wings when she was in the chair?
<p></p>Heh at the bear holding the teacup
<p></p>Wait,  did Fluttershy say "Who's Applejack?" Could she have cloned herself as well?
<p></p>And Angel somehow ends up in the bear's paw
<p></p>Lol,  sudden slowdown
<p></p>Oh,  I thought the Pinkie who went with RD was the clone
<p></p>...And this is where it goes bad
<p></p>Did anyone else think of the gulls from Finding Nemo with all the Pinkie clones?
<p></p>I expected the water tower to get destroyed too
<p></p>...And that's exactly what happened
<p></p>A secret switch? Then again,  it would make sense why they would hide the book
<p></p>Suddenly,  Fancy Pants
<p></p>Some of those faces are just creepy
<p></p>I do kind of enjoy how Pinkie doesn't know if she's the real Pinkie
<p></p>Watching paint dry :P
<p></p>And the weeding out process is slightly disturbing
<p></p>"Look what I can do with my hooves"
<p></p>G3 Pinkie face
<p></p>Yeah,  probably for the best they seal the pond up
<p></p>And Pinkie's leg twitch when she snored was strangely cute
<p></p>Well,  time to go back and read several pages of posts~

            @Kegi That's a possibility. There's really plenty of different ways that it could work.

            Thank goodness the episode wareleased early because it took me about <em>six hours</em> (probably even more. I didn't check properly) to download!
<p></p>I had to watch the episode at 1 AM!
<p></p>And then it was stuffed with <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>!
<p></p>It had great sight gags and callbacks but that was seriously disturbinbg to me and I spent a significant chunk of the episode completely horrified!
<p></p>Even the orangejay and orangefrog were disturbing!
<p></p>I rewatched it this morning and same conclusion. It had fun parts but I just didn't enjoy it as much as a typical episode.
<p></p>It was just too horrifying!
