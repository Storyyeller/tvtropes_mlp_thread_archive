            @ginger: No,  I see what you;re getting at.
<p></p>The trick with a system like that is simply representing it in a way that becomes engaging. Looking at Persona again(guh),  it's literally <em>all</em> about psychology - even the name is a psychological concept. But it puts it all forward in metaphores,  because a game about a person sitting in his bedroom,  struggling to come to terms with the fact that who HE is isn't the same person that society SAYS he is isn't terribly engaging. Now,  you take this person and turn his personality into a giant monster,  give him the ability to summon it,  and have the ability to summon it be triggered by not defeating,  but <em>accepting</em> his <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a> that openly and loudly espouses his inner secrets,  then have him use that giant monster to fight <em>other</em> giant monsters,  it suddenly becomes much more interesting. an element of the message is lost,  but the game becomes fun and a careful viewer can still see the message.
<p></p>I see where you're coming from completely,  but there's just a trick to taking the moral of the game and making it fun to play.

<p></p>I get this feeling too.  I don't know why they keep forgetting that the other ponies can be cartoonish and funny too ("The Ticket Master" for example.  Actually,  I find Twilight is far more fun when she's being cartoonish).
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">@Moe No,  I was thinking more like the battles including representations of their beliefs and weaknesses based on their neurosis or something. </div>
<p></p>What,  you don't think Twilight would be upset that her Beyblade isn't strong enough and put all her scientific genius into building a battle top to shatter the heavens? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

<p></p>Yeah,  I get what yer talking about.  The trick would be balancing it with playability.  I've seen a lot of <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGs">RP Gs</a> (mostly computer ones) that try to be too nuanced,  and wind up just being unplayable.  The scenario you suggest,  for example,  has the potential to create a lot of <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpells" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpells">Useless Useful Spells</a> if not balanced properly.

            I prefer cartoonish Twilight as well,  though I admit if she were like that all the time she'd likely turn into a one note gag,  same if she were always serious and straight laced she'd likely end up rather bland and 'normal'. Pinkie Pie,  while not 100% comic relief,  is cartoony and air headed the large majority of the time,  and unlike the rest of the cast,  she doesn't really act as such on a driven flaw or motive (eg. Twilight's neurotics,  Rarity's pompousness),  she's just kind of nuts. I don't think she sucks because of this,  but I can see why some think she is a bit one dimentional as a result.

            My problem isn't with Pinkie being cartoony either.  My problem is with a lack of balance re: her exposure and her portrayal.  Put simply,  she needs to be used less often and her antics need to be scaled back just a <em>teensy</em> bit.

            @Kegi I'm actually thinking of it a bit like Psychonauts,  where almost EVERYTHING is representative of something else.
<p></p>In Persona 4,  certain characters are weak to certain elements,  now those elements aren't explained. What I suggest is instead of say,  lightning and fire,  you have egotism and stubborness.

            I think it's more down to the fact that Pinkie is usually meant to be more of a foil to another character to get reactions from them for comic relief rather than have a huge involvement in story. When she does play the main star she comes off as more whole and sympathetic in her antics (eg. A Friend In Deed). The same could be said for most of the characters really,  after all the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticPOV" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticPOV">Sympathetic P.O.V.</a> can't be on all of them each and every minute,  just Pinkie more frequently is designated as such rather than getting (semi) serious development like the other lot.

            @Ginger: Yeah... Yeah,  I definitely see you point. In the design document for the system I'm already regarding 'magic' as mental,  so simply chanign elements to different mental elements is simple enough.
<p></p>The main issue is readability. It feels sort of arbitrary to have weaknesses and strengths like egotism and compassion when they effectively function the same as magic elements,  which are genre conventions.

            @kegi well you could have negotiation encounters mixed with mental battles,  that way egotism and compassion and the like could serve dual roles. Say,  you leave a mental battle with your Compassion drained,  you wouldn't be able to use said compassion in a future negotiation until you built it back up.

            Y'know,  this kinda brings to mind my thought about how I'd like to see a video game with a pacifistic main character. Granted,  this kinda clashes with the "power fantasy" shtick of typical action games. I'm aware of games where pacifist runs are possible,  such as <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEx" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThiefTheDarkProject" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThiefTheDarkProject">Thief The Dark Project</a>.

            The problem with a pacifist main character isn't that the type of character isn't doable story-wise. It's that combat is usually what keeps a game from being boring. It's certainly doable,  you just need to find a new source of conflict and an engaging gameplay style,  which isn't easy.
