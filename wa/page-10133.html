Well,  she did put the kids to sleep and cleaned up the mess that pretty much spanned the entire shop. She's not the same person she was at the beginning of the episode.

            On the other hand,  you can also get too much symbolism,  like in <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SongOfSolomon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SongOfSolomon">Song Of Solomon</a>.

            My only gripe is the statement that the plots of the earlier episodes aren't conflicts because...they are.  They might be internal conflicts (i.e. in Ticket Master the conflict is mostly internal),  but saying that there's no conflict because none of the characters are fighting each other doesn't really make any sense.
<p></p>As for the cliches; yeah,  a lot of the plots have been done before,  but I think the execution is good enough that the episodes on the whole aren't too bad.  I mean,  yeah,  we could see the ending of Ticket Master coming from a mile away,  but we still got some interesting character interaction which I think makes it more than worth watching.

            I think that It's About Time was the weakest episode for me,  and that can mostly be chalked up to the plot being predictable.

            Eeyup.  Man,  was I an idiot in high school.   Well,  I still am,  but now I'm more aware of the fact.
<p></p>Anyway,  It's About Time was a bit of an odd one for me; on a technical level it has a lot of issues,  namely that the plot is incredibly predictable and it has filler out the wazoo (was replaying the scene of Twilight giving herself the message <em>really</em> necessary?),  but at the same time,  it's probably in my top ten episodes for S2 just because it entertained me despite it's flaws.  Pinkie's whole "I keep balls stashed all over Ponyville in case of emergencies" thing was way funnier than it had any right to be.

            Most people are mature in some areas and immature in others.
<p></p>I think I was more respectful on average,  but more emotionally confused as a teenager. So give and take.
