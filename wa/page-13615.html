            @JT The thing is,  though,  that Celestia obviously didn't become an Alicorn in the same manner that Twilight did,  since the spell Twilight cast to do so had never been performed before. Combined with the apparent disappearance of the Element of Magic,  who knows what exactly happened to her body.

            Well,  and home,  glad to see overall peopleliked the episode,  and hopefully can quit bitching about Twilacorn.
<p></p>And yeah we are now in a no pony zon...wait no we are not.
<p></p>Seriouly looking forward to the next few months,  just to see what fan content comes out,  plus the comics,  the offical books,  all the panels and Q&amp;A's with the writers and staff at all the cons coming up. There will be plenty to do while we wait for season 4

            We've still got the movie.  If it takes place after this episode,  it might just clear up some of what we're discussing.

            The movie has been confirmed to be the launch of the new IP,  so nope.
<p></p>Plus Megan said she considered this episode to be part 1 of a three part story. So the premeir of season 4 should be a two parter picking up with dealing with what happened.

            <div class="quoteblock">That's the major thing that bothered me. Even if it was boosted by the Elements,  it was still a two-line spell that cost apparently no effort to cast and didn't even require Twilight to be wearing her Element (which every other effect,  including petrification and purification,  as well as the magic resistance the Elements grant,  requires). </div>
<p></p>The weirdest part is that apparently you can make up new spells just by rhyming.

            I still can't stop wondering about what exactly happened to the Element of Magic. Is it physically a part of Twilight now? Has it reverted to the state it was in before the pilot,  invisible and waiting for a new "spark" to awaken it? Is this whole thing just a stupid plot hole? I guess we'll find out next time the Elements become relevant.

            The same gem that's in the element of Magic seems to be part of her princess crown,  so it's possible that the element just vanished and re-manifested later.
