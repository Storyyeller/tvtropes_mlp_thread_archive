<p></p>I had this weird dream that I'd gotten into Stanford and was just about to start classes there. Woke up thoroughly disappointed that it wasn't actually a thing.
<p></p>And why Stanford,  of all places? I'm not exactly in the neighborhood.

            @Mousa: that actually sounds like a lot of fun! Lord knows I've got plenty of answers for you to pick from,  too.
<p></p>I am working on something at the moment,  though I've accepted it isn't going to be finished today,  and what I do want to get done won't take that long,  so I'd be more than happy too(I was planning on doing a comic of Hoops playing a joke of Bell,  but I'm sure I can squeeze it all in. Though the joke might be a bit mean.)
<p></p>Also,  thanks to everyone who complimented the picture! I don't normally work with vectors,  but it's turning out really well so far. Well... the background is sort of bleh,  but oh well.

            @Mousa - Ive always heard that an artist's number one gripe is to be asked to render their services for free.  Plus I would feel guilty asking someone to do a favor for a perfect stranger without some form of compensation.

            @Kyler,  It's a cover image I'm doing for a story as a comission. The story is about A colt named finial,  the nervous-looking earth pony,  in an abusive relationship. the big Earth pony beside him is his abuser,  and the big pegasus is the stallion who helps him get out of it.
<p></p>It was actually kind of weird drawing the big EP. Because I read the story,  and I couldn't help but think of all the terrible things he does in it,  but at the same time he looks... well,  nice. It's a bit of a disconnect in my brain,  really.

            There were a lot of pictures. I don't remember it very well. I think there was one that looked like a pear except that it had a mouth for some reason.

            Emidawg,  in case it wasn't patently obvious previously I do anything for everyone for free with absolutely nothing and let's face it I'm not worth paying for. Beleive it or not we're all pretty swell chaps.
