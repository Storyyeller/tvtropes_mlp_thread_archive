<p></p>Plus,  a Supernova,  if close enough,  is visible during the <em>day</em>.  The Orion Nova was bright enough to read by it by night,  they say.

            Hmm.  Could've been a thug or a mob heavy.  Think of it,  no one would take the silent,  guy miming things and constructing a box around you too seriously.  But when he seals you in one and leaves you for a few days until you agree to pay the protection fee....  then who's laughing?

            Actually,  I'm not sure what the specifics told to us in the pilot was,  but what if those stars that released Luna were set up by Celestia?
<p></p>Like,  she made it so that they absorbed harmonious energy from ponies as they spent time outside at night. The more time they spend outside celebrating it,  the more energy the stars get,  and when it reaches critical mass it releases the lock on the moon. The less time ponies spent outside,  the more the star's power wanes.
<p></p>Basically,  she rigged it so that Luna will only be released when Equestria has fully come to respect her night,  and she's had students primed to wield the elements for the past 1000 years.

            Ginger - good stuff,  but one small quibble:  timeframe.  Luna has only been out for a year.  That makes our Other Six just out of adolescence,  and quite a bit younger than the Mane Six.
<p></p>I think the nova-when-they-fought angle works.
<p></p>Unless you want a second nova that drew them together and hearlded Nightmare Moon's escape.  That's doable,  I think.

            Yeah,  and the first one actually went nova the moment Celestia and Luna fought,  a millenia ago.  Second one's timing is unimportant,  only that that is what pulls them together.
<p></p>^ Yeah,  that works great.  Knight errants and all that.  Now that She knows that some respect Her work and Her night,  She goes about orchestrating them together to do stuff.

            @badwolf Who wrote that prophecy? We don't know if it was Celestia. That was just a rumour that developed over the years thanks to paranoid nutjobs (Hi Foil!Twi) She just happened to pick the right time.
<p></p>Celestia could probably sense that the stars were at brimming point and would probably go off during that years summer sun celebration,  so decided to mobilize Twilight then and there

            ^That's nonsense.  If the Elements of Harmony were being treated like a first-response system,  they wouldn't be in the Everfree Palace.  Celestia would have a hold of them in Canterlot,  since she'd need to check them every generation.  More importantly,  that makes Twilight and her friends just another group in a long line of schlubs.  They're not destined Bearers; they're the latest in a long line of potential failures.
<p></p>Why would you set up your sealed-evil-in-a-can to be released on a variable timer,  especially when that timer isn't anything that would purify Luna?

The same thing could just happen again.
<p></p>Also,  why would the elements still be in the Everfree forest if Celestia KNEW when Luna would be released in 1000 years. Why not have the element bearers be ready with them for when Luna steps out? She had ALL the time in the world to prepare.
<p></p>I figured that the conflict imposed by Nightmare Moon was always going to be part of what brought the element bearers together (like it did in the pilot) Kinda like a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> against NM.
<p></p>The same sequence of events would've happened 10 years ago,  or 100,  or 500. Just with different element bearers
<p></p>AND I always figured that Celestia could sense the condition of the stars,  and the second things started to reach their brimming point she'd move the group into action

            Yes.  Celestia had to allow the Bearers to be tested for them to realize that they were Bearers at all.  No test,  no revelation,  no Harmony.
<p></p>All Luna is doing now is trying to make amends.  As as we've seen already,  there are ponies who do appreciate the night.  Twilight is an avid fan,  for example,  so much that she wanted the constellations on her GGG gown to be perfect.
<p></p>Oh,  here's an idea.  Luna is gathering this motly crew of Stallions in order to help her remain aware that ponies still appreciate Her nights.
<p></p>She wants to be loved,  guys.
