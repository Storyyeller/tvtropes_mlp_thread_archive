            Wow,  managed to go a refresh without any new posts. We're slowing down,  guys.
<p></p>So,  does anybody think that anything from this episode is going to carry into next season? Chrysalis and the changelings returning? Rarity might find a relationship since she's the one who caught the bouquet?

            (I'm just going to repost this. Keeping track of the votes was quite a chore,  you know)
<p></p><em>Fillies and Gentlecolts</em>! The Royal wedding has been a huge success<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKXlhpeb6wI">according to most<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></div></span>,  and now,  season two has been officially wrapped up. It is time for us to determine just who is <em>Best Pony Season Two</em>!
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="../wa/page-1989.html#post-49701">Here are the results of last time<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. This time,  40 Tvtropes bronies have voted,  which is a pretty major increase compared to last time's 24. Well,  what can I say,  there will always be more bronies every day,  and it seems that we've gained 16 since then. It is good to see the message of love,  tolerance and quality entertainment hasn't failed to reach out to more and more people.
<p></p>Now,  let us get to the main event: we will now announce the official ranking,  as well as <em>Best Pony Season Two</em>!
<p></p><ul><li> <strong>#6: Rainbow Dash</strong>,  with 4 votes for first,  4 x second and 3 x third,  gaining a total of 45 points. Season two hasn't been particularly good to Rainbow Dash. While everyone knows her as the local <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>,  episodes like <em>May The Best Pet Win</em> or <em>The Mysterious Mare-Do-Well</em> seemed to focus to much on the 'jerk' part. While <em>Hurricane Fluttershy</em> did a good job in redeeming her,  it was not enough to save her from the lowest rank. Relatively speaking. We hope to see her do better next time.
</li><li> <strong>#5: Pinkie Pie</strong>,  with 2 votes for first,  3 x second,  13 x third,  for a total of 58 points. Ponyville's biggest party-animal was finally allowed to show of her personality in a way that didn't involve parties in <em>Baby Cakes</em>. While people still seem reluctant to give her the top spot,  she definitely managed to win a special place in our hearts.
</li><li> <strong>#4/3: Applejack</strong>,  who was given 5 votes for first,  7 x second and 6 times third,  which adds up to 71 points. Poor Applejack never seems to be given the spotlight for herself; even on these rankings,  she now has to share the third/fourth place with some other pony for the second time in a row. She's nothing if not consistent. Her lack of obvious character flaws makes for little interesting television,  but we as a whole appear to admire her dependable personality. Applejack may not be the most entertaining pony,  but she posses a character that we should all strive for.
</li><li> <strong>#4/3: Fluttershy</strong>,  with 3 votes for first,  8 x second and 8 x third,  gaining her 71 points. Last time's runner-up will now have to be satisfied with sharing the bronze. While she is most certainly still very cute,  we got to see very few new depths to her character this season,  which might explain why her dropping in the rankings. That said,  she is still a fan-favourite,  and competition was tight. Despite her lowered ranking,  anyone that dares to say anything bad about her will still be lynched within seconds.
</li><li> <strong>#2: Rarity</strong>,  being given top spot 10 times,  second place 6 times and third place 8 times,  for a total of 98 points. Quite a few people have said something along the following lines: "X is best pony,  but Rarity gets the best episodes". <em>Sisterhoof Social</em> and <em>Sweet and Elite</em> are indeed some of the more touching stories that still managed to be funny. This,  combined with her excellent capacity for Ham even when she's not the main character,  makes her one of the most entertaining and well-rounded characters in pretty much all of animation this decade. Brava,  my lady,  brava!
</li><li> <strong>#1: Twilight Sparkle</strong>,  with a whopping 16 votes for first,  in addition to 10 votes for second and 6 for third,  winning <em>Best pony</em> once again by a landslide with 138 points. Was there ever any doubt? Twilight Sparkle,  the nerdy yet lovable prodigy,  is someone that tropers such as ourselves can identify with. Despite her bookish nature,  she showed a capacity for some crazy as well,  which made her all the more endearing. There is no doubt about it. Tvtropes has spoken: Twilight Sparkle is <em>Best Pony Season Two</em>.
</li></ul><p></p>So what do we do now? Well,  we bide our time,  I suppose. The next season won't be here fopr a long time,  but bronies will still be bronies. There will be fanart,  fanfiction,  conventions and whatever else. The internet is a great place,  and ponies made it even better. We eagerly await season three.
<p></p>Have a good hiatus. Bronies forever!

            @Kegi: I still don't think they could do something like that and keep the same overall tone of the show. It's very different building up to some grand ball,  then building up to the return of a mortal enemy.

            What is wrong with Luna preferring to live in the old castle in the Everfree Forest? It explains why she needed to arrive in Canterlot and why she wasn't there at the end.

            <p></p>Y'know,  at first I was kinda underwhelmed by The Queen as a villain,  I don't know what it was but for some reason that was my initial reaction <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(awesomeness of her transformation not withstanding)</span> Then I realized she is possibly the best villain in all of MLP since her plan must have taken quite a bit of time to set up and set into motion and in all of that time,  no one at all was suspicious. It was a subtle kind of evil,  as opposed to Nightmare Moon and Discord,  who generally make a much bigger show of their plans at the first chance they get. The Queen waited until victory was pretty much certain to reveal herself,  which is pretty great.

            Yeah,  fighting changelings was an unexpected twist,  and here I thought it was just clones from a spell gone wrong,  but this is just better. It's like what happened with Luna for me: Expect good,  get FANTASTIC.
