            It's true,  Trixie really is nothing more than show-off that talked big.... and yet,  as of now she's the perfect character for some evil power to be granted to her so she can enact some "revenge" against Twilight.

            Trixie probably specializes in illusions and magic tricks. Not very good for dealing with fifty-foot-tall threats,  but she knows how to keep a crowd entranced.

<p></p>Just as Twilight was the apprentice of Celestia,  so too can Trixie be an apprentice of Twilight.

            What worries me about tomorrow is that they already did this with Griffon The Brush-Off,  at least as far as I can tell from the description. Hopefully they give Spike sufficient snark to offset that.

            Trixie's got some nice shades of blue in her design,  but I wasn't too impressed by her actual <em>character</em>.  I wouldn't be surprised if she showed up again,  but I can't say I'd be <em>thrilled</em> either.  Maybe if she got some decent <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>,  though...  As it is,  she's not too high on my list of minor characters I'd like seeing again.
<p></p>Actually,  with all the CMC episodes,  I'm sort of surprised the bullies haven't shown up again.  You'd think that Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon would still be taunting them about not having their cutie marks — especially since they upstaged them at their own cuteceañera.  And it's not like the girls have been <em>covert</em> about still wanting to earn their marks ASAP.  If either of the libbies walked by and saw another of their failed attempts,  surely they'd take a moment to rub it in...

            A lot of the characters we've only seen in one episode aren't ones I expect to come back. Despite the fans getting excited over them,  I think it'd be best to see new characters rather than see the others shoehorned back in where it wouldn't make much sense.

            It seems to me like he'll be more of the focus of this one,  so he'll probably be more sympathetic. Twilight being who she is,  I imagine the plot will be something to the effect of his trying to get her attention,  and her completely failing to notice it - a double aesop about respecting that sometimes your friends want to hang out with other friends,  and noticing and understanding your friends feelings.
<p></p>In regards to Trixie (yes that conversational thread is gone,  but gosh darnit Trixie came up and I will not rest until my two bits are put in!) I've always been of the opinion that she's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak But Skilled</a> - most of what we've seen so far could be chalked up to lights and sounds - making illusions - and some fine telekineses. I imagine she has a great deal of technical prowess,  easily on twilight's level,  but nowhere near the amount of raw magical force. I figure if she did come back there'd be really good potential for character development,  because it seemed to me that her 'high and mighty' personality didn't hold water. She seemed waaaaaaaay too upset when she was 'revealed' as a phony to actually be that arrogant - of course that's probably more a case of wanting to see something there than it actually being there,  but still.

            Yeah,  she was sure showing some humility when the giant fucking bear was fucking shit up,  but that disappeared as soon as the threat was gone. Remember how she left? I remember her saying something about blah blah The Great and Powerful Trixie.
<p></p>She's about as likely to learn her lesson as the CMC are to remember the aesops they've been handed.

            Hey guys,  WMG something for me.
<p></p>Now,  this series is generally full of nonsense,  but I'm having trouble parsing the episode <em>Feeling Pinkie-Keen, </em> in which we find out Pinkie Pie has the ability to predict things from bodily feelings,  an ability that has never been evidenced before nor,  indeed,  since.
<p></p>So,  why do you think this is?  (In-story reasons please)

            Oh,  sorry for not being clear enough:  The contradiction I wanted worked out is <em>why this is the only episode where its even mentioned.</em>
<p></p>Currently my best guess is that the rest of the time she's simply too <em>busy</em> to pay any attention.

            If I may go for something more post-modern,  perhaps the fact that its a new,  heretofore unmentioned ability is part of that story's overall moral:  in asking Twilight Sparkle if she could believe in Pinkie's predictions despite her pro-science stance,  she was also asking us if <em>we</em> could believe in Pinkie's powers despite <em>our</em> pro-continuity stance!
<p></p>... Then I remember that Lauren Faust is not <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideoKojima" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideoKojima">Hideo Kojima</a> and I go back to wanting a Watsonian perspective,  to which I'll add that maybe the predictions only happen during the days when Pinkie Pie is on some sort of "Pony Period."
