<p></p>Back on topic,  yeah. I really,  really want to see Sweetie get some real screen time. She's so gosh-darn cute,  I just love her,  and it bugs me that the only thing we see of her are really unrelated memes... some of the worst in the fandom,  really. So I'm looking forward to her having something actually to do.

            Sweetie Belle focus episode.  Could this be our first song of the season?  I sure hope so.  She has a good singing voice,  but we've only really heard one song from her.

<p></p>Ooh... actually,  seeing that written out I hope it doesn't happen. That sounds like it would hurt way more than Pinkie's...

            I don't know if Sweetie Belle really has enough characterization for her flipping out to be as effective.  When Fluttershy or Twilight or Pinkie flip out its funny because of how well we know them and how differently they're acting.  The joke would fall a bit flat for a character who hasn't really had that much screen time.  I mean,  what do we really know about Sweetie Belle?  She's sweet,  and she likes singing.  This episode should be more about giving her characterization.  That way she can go crazy in a later episode.

            I think it depends on the setup; if the first chunk of the episode is dedicated to her getting worked up about the Sisterhooves thing,  it would make more sense if she freaks out in act 2 when Rarity refuses to do it.  Granted,  it won't be as dramatic as Pinkie or Twilight's breakdowns,  but I don't think it has to be.  In this case the fact that she's freaking out isn't the point,  it's the fact that it's her relationship with her sister causing the problem.  And the plot doesn't really require a freak out like the ones that the other ponies have had.  My guess is that it'll probably be closer to the conflict in Look Before You Sleep.

            That would work.  I'm wondering how Rarity will handle it.  I'm hoping that she will realize how upset Sweetie Belle is and try to make it up to her,  rather than getting upset herself.  We really don't know much about how Rarity feels about her sister.  Most of their interaction seems to result in slight annoyance on Rarity's part.

            As I've said before,  at first I didn't like Pinkie or Rarity. I do <em>now</em>,  but I still prefer the rest of the mane six.
<p></p>I've always <em>loved</em> Twilight and Fluttershy and it took me a long time to decide who I liked more. Especially as it's very unusual for the protaganist to be my favourite. (In fact,  this <em>may</em> be the first time.)
<p></p>Also,  that <em>does</em> sound like an interesting episode.

Give up TV Tropes?  Are you <em>CRAZY?!</em>  /pinkie-pie
<p></p>I like all the characters,  but I admit I'm still having a tough time warming up to Rarity.  Pinkie Pie is still the best,  but Twilight's been moving up a few notches for me after the start of Season 2.
<p></p>And am I the only person who thinks Sweetie Belle "unfriending" Rarity sounds weird?  They're <em>sisters</em>...

<p></p>It probably goes a long way to prevent homelessness and proverty in Equestria.
<p></p>"Coin for a pinch of salt,  mister?" <br>"Eh,  why don't ya go graze somewhere ya lazy bum!"
<p></p>I think it's not really a sensible question,  though - just like in our culture,  when prepared,  hygienic,  and relatively cheap food is avaliable up close,  why'd you travel to the outskirts of town for something that is less filling,  tasty,  takes more time to find,  and you may even catch something from eating it?

<p></p>Also,  the closest I can think of any Ponies that have grown on me is Scootaloo. I can't say I ever didn't like her,  but she did go from not really being on my radar to being my second favorite between Pinkie and Rainbow Dash. I think sympathy over the apparent Scootabuse may have helped contribute to that,  but I do know I find her spunk appealing.

            Generally,  the stuff we eat can't simply be found by going outside and shoving our faces into the ground,  at least that's the case where I live. We eat a mixture of meats,  vegetables,  nuts,  and other things that require preparation to eat. The ponies... don't. Twilight responded very positively to the thought of eating flowers,  so they can at least eat those straight up pretty happily.
<p></p>Ponies have food that they enjoy INSTANTLY and effortlessly available to them the second they trot out the front door,  we don't. I guess the point I'm making isn't that they'd NEVER buy food (as others have said there'd be numerous ponies still willing to shill out bits for the more fancy stuff) I'm just surprised that we've never seen a cheapskate pony grazing <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>and in Ticket Master: Why didn't Twilight just graze on something if she was so hungry? I'm not asking that seriously,  it just struck me right now.
