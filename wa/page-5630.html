            Well,  that's fair.  It's true that I never felt like Katniss or Peeta were ever really in any danger (though that may have been because I knew that they won as a pair going into the movie),  so I may not be the best judge.

<p></p>The whole point of Katniss getting a highscore wasn't to show she was more skilled then anyone (she wasn't) it was to show the Gamemakers had it out for her from the start and that Katniss had a hard time control her temper.

            I also thought each book was an improvement over the former,  ignoring Mockingjay's awful,  awful ending.  But none of them were particularly good.  I really don't understand why the series is so popular.
<p></p>@Ginger: Why would you care about Cato?  He was completely devoid of personality.  The only reason I remember who he is is that he had a cool name.

            @Ginger: Ah,  so we're in agreement on that part. I legit didn't care about any character beyond Cato,  and even then only in his moment of pity. With the exception of Foxface(whom I referred to as Ginger throughout),  if only for the sheer,  <em>massive balls</em> she had throughout that movie. Every time she was onscreen I expected her to kick it,  but she ran into everything blindly and came out roses.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">No it wasn't. They didn't give us enough time or reason to care about her,  and the whole funeral and riot felt pointlessly contrived because no one cared when any of the other characters died. Hell,  Katniss should have been holding the funeral for the person <em>she</em> killed,  that would have made more sense.

            well,  if you don't care about the characters,  the story failed in some way. Granted ginger's got some rather unique criteria......point is,  if you don't care about the characters,  there's really no point to a story,  but what I've seen of the Hunger Games stuff...not impressive to me.

<p></p>It could be because I came in having read the novel,  where it makes a slight bit more sense,  or it could be because a TWELVE YEAR OLD CHILD WAS MURDERED RUTHLESSLY but that scene made me cry.

            @Sky Strike: If you like post-apocalyptic stories and can appreciate a unique writing style,  you should check out David Palmer's <em>Emergence</em>.  It's a really good read.  Might be hard to find,  though.
