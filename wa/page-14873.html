            Per word of Megan,  Twilight isn't going to outlive her friends,  so no change to her aging.
<p></p>And we also know that season 4 will have an episode dealing with disability,  so it could be the Scoots learns she can never truly fly episode. Or a Derpy one.
<p></p>As to Sombra,  "presence" was what Megan was going for,  she intended him to be more of a Sauron type force then a character,  which did come off as like that,  but could have been handled better. Plus after the over the top amazing characters we've had as villains,  it was just weird having one who wasn't.

            Actually,  I dare to say he was a better overall villain than Discord and somewhat on par with Chrysalis(Nightmare Moon is IMO too bland to consider). However,  the previous two were,  like you noted,  hilariously over the top and had larger-than-life personalities which makes them whole different characters than Sombra who had a quiet,  highly pragmatic approach to things and,  like stated,  was more of a force-of-nature.
<p></p>He'd fit more in a book or a video game,  to be honest.

            Actually we don't <em>know</em> that an alicorn doesn't age. At least ascended ones. Celestia and Luna lived a pretty long-ass time,  but they might have been born alicorns or something.

            Agreed. As a villain,  he was one of the most competent and just all around best. Coming damn close to winning and not failing because of his own mistakes.
<p></p>It's just as a character he failed when compared to the other villains we've had. To reserved,  to distant. But yeah as part of a larger story,  he'd work better,  or in a book.

            Sombra's main issue was that everything we knew about his personality was second-hand.  He had a ton of potential,  but they didn't really make as much use of it as they could have.  I wish we would have actually gotten more out of him than just "RRRR CRYSTALS".  Basically,  the concept (a unicorn who uses his intelligence and magical skill to take over a nation and make himself dangerous enough that it takes two alicorns to take him down) is pretty awesome,  but unfortunately the execution (an evil cloud who growls a lot) didn't do the concept justice.

<p></p>I'll admit that I don't really care much for the concept of Sombra. The Sauron archetype just doesn't do it for me.

            Honestly the problem is that they tried to hard to make him into a Sauron type villain when 1. the concept doesn't really meld well with what we know of the character and 2. it's really hard to do that sort of villain when you only have 40 minutes. If he had been a season-spanning villain it would have worked better.

            Perhaps we get to see him later as a less sauron like villain. I mean its all but stated he will be coming back.

            Actually,  while there were hints in the show,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word Of God</a> is he is dead and gone. though would be interesting to see him in backstory,  see his rise to power and first defeat.

            @JT We need one of those villains at some point. And I want dark magic back,  if only for a 'Twilight flirts with evil' episode.

            Wasn't it stated though that he's the only villain to be actually killed? Ah,  got ninja'd.
<p></p>Also,  that talk about alicorn creation makes me wonder... Cadence is probably a natural alicorn. Maybe. However,  where are her parents? Were they alicorns as well or is it some sort of one-of-a-kind magical mutation that happens every one hundred years?
<p></p>We <em>could</em> use some changelings in Season 4 though.

            Well,  depending on how seriously you take stuff not explicitly mentioned in the show,  the junior novel 'Twilight Sparkle and the Crystal Heart Spell' states that Cadence was an orphaned <em>pegasus</em> who defeated an evil queen,  some stuff happened,  and then Alicorn.

<p></p>This description is just vague enough to apply perfectly to Twilight as well,  except without the orphan part.
