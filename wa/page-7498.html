            @ Librarian
<p></p>When an old enemy from school came to the shop and started his antics again,  she joined in.  And then she told him she had given me her number and just basically laughed in my face.  She was drunk,  but that's no excuse.

            ...I'm a selfish asshole,  and the universe is conspiring to keep me from reading Project Horizons.
<p></p>I'm at my nans. My sis has just had the mother of all asthama attacks,  and had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance.
<p></p>Now I was literally JUST leaving the house with my sister's Kindle when my dad arrived saying that my sis wanted it while she was in hospital.
<p></p>Oh,  I got so fucking angry. I literally raced out into the storm outside and marched all the way to the hospital on foot. (I think I was actually pausing every now and then to scream at the top of my lungs) I basically barged into my sister's sick room.
<p></p>...and then I saw her. Almost dead. Hooked up to god knows what. God I'm such a selfish dick. I couldn't even look at her I felt so guilty so I stormed back
<p></p>and then I decided to print off the chapters... the printers broken...

            Yeah Apple,  I read what happened to you and I'mreally sorry about it. It was a really tough shift. But you're starting to sound like my step-mother about this which isn't a good thing! Personally,  I'm the opposite. No one has ever appologised to me before I've forgiven them and that works for me! Now,  I'm not telling you to take it to my extreme,  but at least allow second chances when the person has displayed regret.

<p></p>Oh,  btw guys?  She texted me again.  She says she may have let my number fall into his hands,  which might explain the missed call from an anonymous number I got last night.
<p></p>She says she's really really sorry.  I just thanked her for the big serving of shit she's given me,  and then told her to delete my number again.

            @Chada from like a page ago: I actually made that post from my iphone while I was waiting to start the exam.  The exam itself was...okay.  I only got about 4 1/2 hours of sleep last night,  so I was a little off,  but I'm pretty sure I passed.
<p></p>@Apple: She <em>was</em> a bitch,   but you probably shouldn't let one bad decision color your entire perception of her.  Of course,  you had better be sure she's <em>really</em> sorry,  and like everyone else,  I don't really know the whole situation anyway.
<p></p>@Ginger: Hope your sister is okay.
<p></p>In other news,  I think I'm actually (I can't believe I'm saying this after what happened yesterday) going to give Fallout Equestria a shot.  There are several reasons for this:
<p></p>1. I <em>hate</em> the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeAversion" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeAversion">Hype Aversion</a> is a even a thing that exists,  and I feel a bit hypocritical for complaining about it without actually giving it a fair shot. Especially in light of the fact that-
<p></p>2. It's popular enough and I've seen enough recommendations that I can safely assume that it's popular due to quality and not just the novelty of the premise.  Even if I don't care for the premise,  I've heard enough praise for the quality of the writing itself that it's worth looking into.
<p></p>3. After repeatedly telling people (especially Ginger) to try stuff even if they think they won't like it,  it would be kinda dumb to reject something because of that,  especially since I've heard so many good things about it.
<p></p>4. If we're going to keep having derails about it,  I want to know what the heck is going on.
<p></p>5. I'm a fast enough reader that it won't be a huge time commitment,  and if I really don't like it,  I can just drop it.
<p></p>...Dang this is a long post.
