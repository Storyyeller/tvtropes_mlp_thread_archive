            @Fallen: That's another thing I don't like about the episode. If no one worried about the future at all,  we'd be in a shit load of fuck right now. Some people are good at looking into the future and planning things out. We need people like that. Then you have people like me who are horrible at planning things out but are really good at coming up with things on the spot for unexpected problems. We need people like that too.

            yeah to many people confuse "Does not agree with my headcannon" with "totally violates how the show has always been"
<p></p>see again the epic finale rant by that FIM-Fiction auhor that called <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuinedForever" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuinedForever">Ruined Forever</a> becuase the fainle jossed her headcannon of Celestia being an omnipotent omnscient diety...and that everything she claims proves this is pure WTF...like that "fact" that there is a pony bible...it was the book Twilight was readin in the pilot....and somehow Luna becoming NMM is what first introduced evil to ponies.....I gave up trying to follow those twists.
<p></p>point is,  just becuase something contrdicts how you WANT the show to be does not mean it contradicts fats of how the show IS.

            Um,  the message wasn't not to worry about the future. In fact,  it made that quite clear with Spike explicitly not worrying about the future and having it come back to bite him. The message was not to over think the future and drive yourself to a nervous wreck,  but at least plan ahead a little bit.

            Can we please move on from this? I don't like most of Season 2. That's my opinion,  and I'm sticking to it. When it comes to my fan fic,  I'm ignoring most of S2. There's nothing saying that I can't do that. If you guys don't like it then oh well. I'm sorry. I didn't even want to get into this again.
<p></p>So,  what's your favorite fan work period?

            @Ed: I don't want bread.  I'd rather have a muffin.
<p></p>@Seraphem: Yeah,  when I say "discontinuity" I almost always mean "stuff that contradicts previously established elements".  I'm well aware that the show is probably going to mess up my headcanon; there's no reason to expect the show to adhere to it.  It only bugs me when the show contradicts itself.
<p></p>@Perpetual: yeah,  that sums it up.  It was more about taking a middle road; be mindful of the future,  but not to such an extent that it drives you nuts.

            @ Zel wqhich is why you need to watch nthe episoes,  you miss all the subtle things that address what you are saying was wrong. Yes the moral of About Time was "Don't worry to much about the furutre,  just let it come and eal with it" but it also had Spike's "I thought it would be Future!Spike's problem...but now I AM Future!Spike" line that showed,  you also dont' do dumb shit you know will come back to bite you later.
