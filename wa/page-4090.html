            Cloudsdale is the seat of Pegasi Civilisation from before Classical Equestria was founded,  otherwise it's the new cultural center of Equestrian Pegasi. There are other places for Pegasi to live,  but Cloudsdale is the center of their racial culture.

            What Ace said,  basically.  Cloudsdale is unique in that it might actually be the original city of the pegasi; Platinum's castle,  if it still exists,  is where it sat beforehand,  and the earth ponies certainly wouldn't move their physical village,  but the pegasi could presumably have just moved Cloudsdale and reshaped the prevailing air currents so it wouldn't move after it was placed somewhere in Equestrian airspace.
<p></p>I mean,  granted,  we haven't heard of other pegasi towns,  and Equestria isn't really huge,  but it can't be the only pegasus town.

            Now I can imagine Daring going to Old Cloudsdale,  a massive stone-and-cloud derelict city just above the peak of a gigantic mountain. All the grey (dust-filled) ancient clouds that look just like the stone pillars they weave amongst,  the Greek/Spartan style deco,  the greened bronze equipment lying unused inside old houses.
<p></p>Daring Do and the Saddle of Hurricane! She heads out to Old Cloudsdale to hunt down a piece of Commander Hurricane's original armor or something.

            I think it could be the only pegasi city in Equestria. It's a big city and there doesn't seem to be many pegasi in Equestria. And some pegasi (Fluttershy,  Scootaloo) live on the ground anyway.

            @Ace: Wouldn't that be akin to Hurricane's lingerie? XD
<p></p>^This is another consideration.  It may be that we're getting a biased sample,  since not many pegasi live in Ponyville,  it seems,  but there does appear to be slightly fewer pegasi (and unicorns) than earth ponies.

            Well we've only seen Canterlot and Earth Pony towns mainly. The one time we saw Cloudsdale it was all in the industrial area or at the invite only/expensive sports event.

            That would make no sense whatsoever. Each town has their own weather team. It'd take forever for different teams to just travel away from Cloudsdale and then back.

            ^I wouldn't think so.  Cloudsdale handles big stuff like rainbows,  but I expect that Ponyville has its own team for storms and clouds and stuff.
<p></p>One thing that really annoys me is people assuming Dash lives in Cloudsdale.  It's gotta be a ways away (though not more than a few hours by train).

            Even if Dash did live in Cloudsdale would it really matter? She's the fastest flyer in Equestria,  she could just fly to Ponyville in a minute or two. Or course,  it would be difficult for her friends to contact her.
