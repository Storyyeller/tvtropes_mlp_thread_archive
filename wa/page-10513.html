            @ATC Equestrian law enforcement seems to accept sincere apologies so long as the offending party learned their lesson and no permanent damage was done.

            @Applelight: I would definitely that sort of plot.  A feel that it could be done on the show,  but it'd have to done in a multi-episode story arc.  Personally I think a multi-episode arc or even a miniseries could potentially do it better than a movie.

            Not to mention that Ponyville apparently gets destroyed so often that something like this is honestly not the biggest issue that's happened.  Besides,  Twilight's brainwashing thing wasn't intentional for the most part.  As soon as it went bad she <em>knew</em> she had screwed up and it had been a bad idea.

            @ATC They were a bit edgy for a kid's show,  but still within the realm of it. Something like your suggestion would be if they dropped the kid's title altogether.
<p></p>For example,  there's an episode of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendOfKorra" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendOfKorra">Legend of Korra</a> where Amon ambushes Korra,  and scares the hoof out of her. Because the show is Y7,  the only thing Tenzin was worried about was if he took her bending,  but if it was an older demographic,  rape might've been implied.

            @Sky: That would be cool,  but I don't think she's the "raise her own army and take over the town" type of villain.  If anything,  the mane cast could recruit her to help take Ponyville back.
<p></p>@Marston: I just subscribe to the KISS paradigm; no reason to spend time introducing a whole new set of characters when there are ones already around that would work fine.  I generally prefer development for existing characters over getting new ones introduced all the time.

<p></p>Y'know what might be nice?  If the invaders are 'reasonable',  with some understandable reason for doing what they are doing,  and some sort of peace treaty is written up,  rather than them being purely evil nasty invaders.

<p></p>@JT: You can have the changlings be the invaders,  but you'd probably at least need one or two more changling charectors to work with alongside Chrysalis.

            But in the second scenario I mention,  they aren't necessarily mean nasty,  invaders.  Just scared people taking desperate measures to ensure the Status Q and maintatin their survival.  Though I suppose that would put the folks invading them on the nasty scale... You know what,  forget it.
<p></p>Anyway,  I'll be seeing you.

            Well,  I finally found and bought the Princess Wedding Castle that has Shining Armor and Cadance in it!  It was rather lucky and interesting that I found it.  I knew that I had seen "July 31" listed as a release date,  but while the Target website said that it was available online,  it said "not sold in stores."  Fully expecting that they would still say "No,  we don't have it, " I still called Target just to check.  And in a happy surprise,  they actually DID have the playset in stock,  and I was able to go get it.  So now Twilight has her brother and her old foalsitter back!
<p></p>Speaking of store surprises,  my story was a happy one,  but I read one on <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CakeWrecks" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CakeWrecks">Cake Wrecks</a> that was just shocking in how negligent the store people (and whoever bought the "cake") could be.  Basically,  it's not a real cake,  it's a cardboard box with icing on it:
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://cakewrecks.squarespace.com/home/2012/7/31/hey-this-cake-tastes-like-cardboard.html">http://cakewrecks.squarespace.com/home/2012/7/31/hey-this-cake-tastes-like-cardboard.html<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<p></p>And then I wondered,  what would the MLP characters do if any one of them ordered a cake that was like the messed-up ones on Cake Wrecks?  Or if they were given one at a party or something of that nature?  I think it would probably depend on the situation and the circumstances of who made the cake and who was ordering it (and how the mistake came about),  but I think that Twilight and definitely Rainbow Dash would be the most likely to be very vocal about criticizing the mistakes on it (or if it was funny,  Rainbow would probably just make fun of it).  Rarity might be upset too,  but depending on the situation she might try to be polite and pretend like she liked it anyway (if the baker or the pony giving it to her was someone she didn't want to offend).  Pinkie would probably just think it was funny and would probably take a bite and say "See girls,  it's still yummy cake!"  However,  Pinkie would probably hate it if she thought she was getting cake and it was just a box with icing on it (unless it turned out to be a prank and there was a real cake after all).

<p></p>Yeah.  Like they follow a conduct of war,  keeping civilians out of it etc.
<p></p>I have the image of chariots (substituting for trucks/tanks etc) slowly rolling through Ponyville as the guy on the back uses a bull horn to tell ponies to 'remain calm and return to their homes etc'.
