Pretty much all the other ponies show more amusing distinctive reactions to Spike's brief favors to them than AJ does the whole episode.

<p></p>I still can´t get over how cool that little snippet Spike got today. Each character has a diferrent music theme but I don´t recall Spike having one before and this is really good. It fits him so well.

            It was pretty much Applejack trying for a gentle let-down against a stubborn person.
<p></p>What I love about Applejack is that she <em>doesn't</em> fly off the handle so often. If you don't like that,  fine,  just don't try to make her into something she's not. (That goes for other people too,  fictional or otherwise.)

The very fact she is trying to bottle it up in may have actually made it funnier (similar to Rarity's very enforced restraint in Sisterhooves Social) compared to most instances before she just speaks her mind.

            Yeah,  it's honestly pretty nice to see someone actually react in an appropriate manner,  and lay off on the zany scheme until it's evident that nothing else is going to work.

            I liked the episode. Highlight was probably the Timberwolves,  really like the look of them. To spare the dignity of AJ and the Titan Timberwolf I'm going to imagine the penultimate scene occurred differently.

            Yeah,  more than anything else,  I kinda wish they had found a way to make that a little less anticlimactic.  I mean,  they could have had Spike rebuild the rock tower,  only to accidentally knock it over onto the wolf or something.

Since S1 AJ was so used to speaking her mind and letting it all out,  it may have been amusing seeing her in a position she is actually trying not to lash out at someone in fear of hurting them,  showing much more strain and desperation in keeping her cool. I get the idea S1 AJ would have had a lot more problems trying to hold it all in.
<p></p>If anything it would have played to her flawed role more,  ie. trying to be the nice guy despite her short temper.

She actually does this in one of the season 3 episodes.

            It was less "perfect" and more "well,  you put in a good effort".  I think it was fairly obvious that it was fake,  but at least they tried to account for all the attributes.

            The thing about bottling things up? You never see it. Not until it spills over. And when it does,  it's usually very big,  very dramatic,  and very nasty.
<p></p>I should know. My life is a big game of "bottle up ALL the things".

            You know,  while I like Season 1 better because of the general feel and the united theme of the Grand Galloping Gala,  I don´t like calling the characters by seasons. It makes it seem like they are diferrent characters. To me they gradually change episode after episode,  S1 Applejack is the same as S3 Applejack,  she just had some development but the character remains the same. All of them do.

            Okay just watch the ep and,  pretty good. Enjoyed it,  Plenty of great moments,  Like Dash admitting to writing bad self insert fics,  and well,  overall damn good. Do think Spike was a bit TO incompetent,  but that could just be because of him being over eager. And the Mega-Wold went down like a chump. but loved that all of the Mane 6 played a part in the ep.

            I wouldn't refer to her as 'Season One Applejack' unless I thought there was a noticable difference in character to that and later seasons. I just feel she seemed a lot more vibrant and versatile in personality early on.
<p></p>Admitedly though S3 and to an extent S2 AJ are mostly just S1 AJ diluted to her Straight Man traits.

            If I had to hazard a guess,  Titan Timber Wolf was just freshly reassembled,  still in the process of regenerating and all,  so he only had a handful of hit points.

            All right,  saw the episode.  Thoughts:
<p></p><ul><li>Really liked AJ in this one.  I thought she had a good mix of being put off by Spike's behavior but not wanting to hurt his feelings.  I guess some people were saying that season 1 AJ would be more likely to get angry at him,  but I don't see it.  Yeah AJ can get upset,  but usually at ponies that will get angry back,  like RD or Rarity.  She never gets angry at Fluttershy for instance,  and I don't see her getting angry at a baby dragon either,  even if he is being annoying.
<p></p></li><li>RD writing cheesy self insert Mary Sue fiction is hilarious and perfect.
<p></p></li><li>As is OCD Twilight stopping her reading to readjust an inkwell.
<p></p></li><li>I didn't mind the CGI on the timberwolves.  I've seen some pretty bad uses of CGI in cartoons,  and this blended pretty well.  Besides,  those things look like a pain in the ass to animate in flash.
<p></p></li><li>Loved the attempt at a fake timberwolf attack.
<p></p></li><li>My biggest issue with the episode was Spike's sudden incompetence.  I think it would have worked just as well if he was capable but AJ wasn't comfortable with him helping so much or was annoyed with how overbearing he was,  but I guess then we wouldn't get wacky hijinks.  Just sort of weird that he immediately goes back to being useful when he returns to Twilight.

<p></p>Enjoyable.  I liked that Spike and AJ came to an understanding at the end since I don't think there are a whole lot of lessons left for AJ to learn about life; she always struck me as the most mature of any of the Mane 6.  I also liked the fact that the Mane 6 all turn up again for an episode after the past few.  More than any other episode,  I liked reading the discussion about this one given that I couldn't really come up with anything to discuss and people were bothered by loads of things that hadn't even occurred to me.

<p></p>A pantheon? Well,  they certainly were going with many boscure references. I still like the timberwolves better,  even if the cel shading was kind of odd.
