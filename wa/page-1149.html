            <div class="quoteblock"> more episodes where AJ's skills are vital to solving the problem at hand. Every ep that focuses on her so far has been emphasizing that she always needs someone to help her (Applebuck,  Look Before),  While the other cast members have been able to single handedly solve their own problems without help in the past. </div>
Heck,  a cynical reading of "Fall Weather Friends" could be "Just admit that Rainbow Dash is better than you so you can stop fighting."
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> I actually think she might be a bit like Twilight. In terms of social awkwardness and adorkability. </div>
I was thinking a mixture of Twilight and Fluttershy would make sense.  She even looks like it!
<p></p>No,  what worries me about Princess Luna's characterization isn't that it will be different from what everybody expects,  but that it <em>will</em> be similar to some fans' guesses,  just because with so many people doing so much speculation,  at some point someone must have guessed correctly.  And then we'll be going "Now why they pick THAT stupid fan's portrayal?"

            But Rainbow Dash wasn't better than AJ. She only won due to blatant cheating.
<p></p>Anyway,  how could Applejack save the day? The only skill she's demonstrated so far is lassoing stuff. Unless they give her something new,  I don't see it happening.

            Yeah. Applejack's really got the short end of the stick.
<p></p>Though I'm sure Applejack would win at applebucking. Rainbow Dash could get all the apples down in seconds,  but her method would also involve destroying the trees and buckets.

            Earth Ponies in general have this problem.
<p></p>It's especially egregious with AJ though because her defining character traits revolve around her being an athlete.
<p></p>Pinkie at least has a character outside of her physical capabilities

            A lot of the competitions were geared heavily towards Applejack to begin with,  though. Like,  lots of stuff given to raw,  physical strenght. And hoof-wrestling or not,  we <em>know</em> RD isn't as a strong as AJ.

<p></p>Judging from that Reliability award,  it seems to be implying that maybe AJ has a host of other skills that we haven't seen yet. Ones that would let her be helpful to ponies

            No no,  that's not what I'm saying at all. <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameDesignModeActivate" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameDesignModeActivate">The competition was broken from the start</a> - it emphasized one competitors skills over the others,  making the other competitor feel like she needed to cheat in order to prevail.  The main issue is,  there's no real sense of balance. The two have extremely different skill sets - not just on a personal level,  but <em>racially</em>. It's like holding a triathalon between a human and a cheeta - the cheeta's going to beat you on the running hands down,  but it's got no chance against you on a bike. It's not a fair judge. I honestly don't think that there's any way to directly compare the races 1-1,  because they all have radically different skill sets and physiology. Earth ponies are tanks,  pegasi are fast and agile,  and unicorns are highly dexterous. And each fails at it's counterparts skills.
<p></p>That's the issue here - no matter how good one pony looks in an episode,  it's hard to compare them to any pony but another of their creed. So while we can call fluttershy more graceful than RD,  and Twilight more magically skilled that Rarity,  what can we call AJ in comparison to Pinkie? She runs on <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> - if it were funny for her to out wrestle AJ,  she could,  even if it made no logical sense.
<p></p><a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KayImDoneNow" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KayImDoneNow">You're definitely right,  though</a>. What AJ needs is a nice good episode where she does something on her own - if nothing else,  it would validate the lessons about her needing somepony else's help every now and again. She has to have a reason for all that pride,  after all. Or at least an on-screen one,  rather than the informed abilities we get in applebuck season.
