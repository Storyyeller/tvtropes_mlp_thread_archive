            Celestia is the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a>. If she has flaws,  she doesn't show them publicly,  having many centuries of practice appearing to be perfect.
<p></p>Luna,  on the other hand,   suffers from a combination of being younger and less experienced,  temporal displacement,  <em>and</em> a pretty hefty inferiority complex. She's just more interesting in terms of <em>known</em> facts,  which is what most people use to judge the characters. If you start delving into Celestia's character in terms of implications and WMG's,  though,  she immediately becomes far more interesting.

            To be truthful,  Luna was always intended to be a bit more humanized,  her personality wasn't established much in the pilot,  but it was obvious she was designed to have issues and humanized flaws rather than being an authority figure.

            Eh,  I kinda like characters in terms of quirk and depth. Hense why Celestia is in the 'okay but not notable' books with me (and likely why I've also been super edgy about AJ becoming more generic).

            @Fallen I LIKE the perfect persona she has. The feeling that she's flawed,  but knows how to hide it.
<p></p>THAT'S IT!!
<p></p>If Blue's here,  you're probably the only one who'll get this,  but I prefer Celestia to Luna for pretty much the same reason I prefer Sansa to Arya in ASOIAF

            @Ginger Then why do you have a problem with people feeling the same way about Celestia? No one <em>hates</em> her. They just value that is shown more than what has to be heavily extrapolated and theorized.
<p></p>And for the record,  I <em>do</em> like Celestia more than Luna,  entirely because of how I've interpreted the small hints we have on their backstrory.
