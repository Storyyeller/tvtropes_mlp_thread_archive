            Oh! Something interesting I noticed when watching the G Gundam parody again.
<p></p>When Cadance and Shining Armor perform the big love-powerd shield wave thing,  take a look at Cadance's mane during the whole sequence. For that short time,  it <em>flows</em>,  much like Celestia's mane. At one point,  even her tail flows. However,  it settles back into a solid shape when the spell is over and they settle on the ground.
<p></p>So,  the flowing mane is definitely an indication of power. However,  Cadance is younger than Celestia or Luna,  and hasn't reached <em>full</em> maturity yet. It's only in moments like that that her mane flows.
<p></p>I think the best analogy I can think of is to think to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonBallZ" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a>. It's like the golden hair of the Super Saiyan state. Meanwhile,  Celestia and Luna are like Goku in the Cell Saga: they're powerful enough that they're in this powerful state at all hours of the day.

            I'm not really seeing much of a tech jump,  TBH. Twilight's lab equipment from Feeling Pinkie Keen is still the most blatant out of place bit of tech in the show,  and considering how we've seen the SSSS6000 function,  it was probably just magic-powered scanning equipment rather than any sort of advanced computer.

            In a society with magic,  magical development is often seen supplanting technological advancement that we had in real life. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullmetalAlchemist" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a> would be a good example. With alchemy forming the basis of the socity,  the country of Amestris saw many advancements through use of alchemical methods,  rather than pure technological advancement. The same can most likely apply to Equestrian society. As such,  a steam engine would likely be less of a major revolution,  and more of a slightly different way of doing things.
<p></p>Back on the subject of flowing manes,  which I get the feeling that nobody else is particularly interested in,  I like the way they've shown us how it works without telling us directly. We saw the marked change in Luna's look,  which suggested she was weakened in her first appearance,  or simply grew older and more powerful in the previous year. Her flowing mane resembles Nightmare Moon's who was clearly more powerful than Luna. We saw Celestia's mane becoming static when she was knocked out by Chrysalis,  suggesting that it can be seen as a sort of indicator of power,  and we saw Cadance's mane briefly take on insubstantial properties during the big scene,  solidifying the whole thing. It just works very nicely,  and they didn't have to say a word.

            @Steve That doesn't mean that it was particularly advanced or complex. Steam engines have been in use since the 1700's,  not exactly modern tech by any means.
<p></p>Not to mention the fact that the train being pulled by the ponies <em>was</em> a steam engine,  just a non-functional one. It probably just broke down at some point,  and the crew had to get out and pull.

            During the big love-wave thing. Perhaps "insubstantial" is the wrong word,  but for that brief time,  Cadance's mane flows just like Celestia's.
<p></p>I find it significant,  considering another shot,  where Celestia's mane solidified when she was knocked flat by Chrysalis.

            @ Crowlover: I was thinking some time between Nightmare Moon's banishment and her return,  but there's nothing set in stone. And on how old Snowcatcher is now,  I was thinking that she could be a historical figure that died years ago. A framing method I was thinking about if I ever could write a fanfic about her would be some ponies maybe doing a project on her.

            I ended up getting my younger brother to watch the finale with my sister and I yesterday,  out of boredom. He actually ended up enjoying it,  but still doesn't care for the series as it normally is. It's not "epic" enough for him,  which is fine by me. My parents simply find it amusing that I watch the show,  and will occasionally poke fun at it,  but I can't get them to sit down and watch an episode. They don't watch cartoons in general,  unless they feel like watching an old Loony Toons short or something like that,  so that's understandable too.
