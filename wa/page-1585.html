            <div class="quoteblock">@ rjung S2 is strong so far but this ep wasn't weakest ,  it was sisterhoof social.</div>
Definitely a case of YMMV,  since I thought "Sisterhooves Social" was one of the best episodes in the season.  Rarity and Sweetie Belle's arguing was more genuine than what you see in most live-action TV shows. Not to say I didn't enjoy "The Cutie Pox",  but it's just overshadowed by its peers.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">As far as Cheerilee stopping the class for it,  for all we know it's normal for ponies to do that. I mean,  getting a cutie mark is basically a life-defining moment,  so it isn't all that weird to put aside an hour or so to celebrate it.</div>
I just figured Cheerilee decided it was a good opportunity to segue the class into some impromptu physical exercise,  which is part of most school curriculums anyway.  If Apple Bloom's cutie mark had been in pottery,  I doubt she'd have derailed the lesson plan for that.

            It seems to be an interesting quality of the fandom. The more deliberately antagonistic they are,  or the more closely the clash with one of the mane six,  the better they're treated. But the ones who are sort of passively antagonistic,  ie. they're just being sort of vaguely rude,  are treated the worst.
<p></p>Like,  I'm one of the few people who would try to defend Blueblood in any degree - he's selfish,  sure,  but I don't believe he was ever a truly bad person.
<p></p>I think what it may simply come down to is focus. DT,  SS and BB have all had very minor roles. They haven't had time to develop nuanced character like Trixie or Gilda had,  so people just default to <em>bitchbitchbitchbitchbitch</em>.

            I think they're all jerks. Trixie a bit less so,  because she did try to help,  even if her efforts were crap.

            Because while Trixie and Gilda are either awesome or would have good reasons for acting like they do,  DT and SS have no good reason for ehatthey're doing. Their entire shtick revolves around "Classmate doesn't have cutie mark,  mock them"

            They even mocked her after she GOT a Cutie Mark. There's just no winning with them,  and Apple Bloom is the sort who tries to be nice to everyone to begin with. She was the only one who gave Zecora a chance,  after all.

            I just never understood how people can harbour such honest HATRED for these characters. We're not supposed to like them,  but we ARE supposed to be entertained by them,  and at that they do their job fantastically. (imo at least)
<p></p>I leather pants Gilda,  Trixie and DT&amp;SS. All the others I just find hilarious. I never honestly wanted to see them suffer like many out there on the internet seem to.

            I think another part of it might be that everybody who was similarly teased in school isn't going to have much sympathy for them.  Trixie,  Gilda,  and Blueblood are all really exaggerated,  whereas DT and SS are more realistic.  And also because it's literally <em>all they do</em>.  They don't really have any plot importance like the more important jerks.  I don't necessarily hate them,  though.  I wouldn't mind if they ended up getting redeemed somehow.

            Cutie marks normally have a vaguer meaning though. They usually relate to a pony's ambition in life,  rather than just what their talented at. (look at the mane cast's and Cheerilee's marks)
<p></p>Apple Bloom's mark was INCREDIBLY restrictive,  ALL the marks spawned by the cutie pox were. So yeah,  I'd say that while hula-hooping isn't a lame TALENT,  it's certainly a lame CUTIE MARK

            The moment Apple Bloom entered the Everfree Forest,  I thought "ZECORA!!"  It's great to see her getting more screen time this season.
