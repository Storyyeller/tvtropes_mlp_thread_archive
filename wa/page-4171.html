            <div class="quoteblock"> Honestly,  I prefer Pinkie's singing voice to her normal voice.
<p></p>She just sounds so much kinder </div>
For me it's ruined by knowing that it's the same voice as <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathNote" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathNote">Misa Amane</a>.  Considering how similar they are in their <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PingPongNaivete" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PingPongNaivete">Ping Pong Naïveté</a>,  maybe this is why it became so popular to paint Pinkie Pie as a serial killer.
<p></p>I would pin "Evil Enchantress" as the surest bet for being sung by Andrea Libman,  since not only is it very short,  but it wasn't meant to sound all that "good" anyway.  Or maybe she sang all the songs that weren't worthy of being listed <a class="urllink" href="http://danielingrammusic.com/songs">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>?  One other observation I had about Pinkie's speaking voice as I was reviewing those is how she gets so excited right before singing "Pinkie's Gala Fantasy Song",  she starts to sound like Russi Taylor,  who was in the original My Little Pony series!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> This one's even worse! How is that possible you ask? Well it's partially because the animators FORGOT TO ANIMATE THE MOUTHS! </div>
I think this was an unfinished version; it's also missing sound effects,  and the end credits are from "Pinkie Pie's Special Day".  (The main idea is that Sweetie Belle does random magic whenever she burps,  and it's kinda lost without all that.)  I couldn't guess where this Youtuber happened to find an in-progress copy of the cartoon,  though.
<p></p>And to be honest,  I've been soured on watching this "Bronies watch" stuff when I know the video they're watching has problems that are the fault of the uploader and not the original production—like when they did the version of "A Very Minty Christmas" from <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishFaerie" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishFaerie">Wish Faerie</a>'s account with the missing scenes,  even though The Hub's website lets you watch the whole movie in good quality for free.

            Well,  ain't this just odd. My Zap2it and Cogeco listings say that Swarm of the Century is supposed to be playing on Treehouse right now,  but all I see is Winter Wrap Up. But by now,  you've probably stopped caring about my complaints.

            But... so does Pinkie's regular voice. I don't really get obnoxious from her voice at least,  so much as what she says. A different VA wouldn't change that.
<p></p>Also,  sorry to hear things are going bad for you Apple. Hopefully they'll start looking up soon.

            @kegi There's just... a piercing harshness to Pinkie's regular voice that her singing va doesn't have. Her singing voice sounds... softer,  less manic.
<p></p>Misa has said much worse than Pinkie,  yet I found her so much more likeable.
<p></p>I found a <em>serial killer</em> more likeable than Pinkie purely cuz of her voice

            Wait,  which Conan,  freeman?  The novels,  the comics,  or the movie?  While all three mediums have their own merits,  I'm guessing the movie.  The best freaking movie!  I kid of course,  but it was still fun.

            @Freeman Have fun cleaning those glasses. I usually forget,  so little smudges dot my vision for the rest of the day.
<p></p>@Shota I don't really think it's possible to make a stage production of an animated show and not have it turn out terribly.

            I suppose there is the squeekiness. I can sort of see that.
<p></p>But to be fair,  you have a multitude of issues with Pinkie that may be colouring your perception a bit here.
