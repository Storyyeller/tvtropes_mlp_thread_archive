            Yeah.  I sincerely doubt Gilda is secretly a gryphon princess. =D
<p></p>As it is,  it seems like pegasi provide the best mix of blocking power and mobility.  Earth ponies would obviously make great land guards,  but they can't fly,  and <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">unicorns are more fragile than earth ponies<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">.  So an even mix seems like the best choice.

            Whoa,  that Gilda thing was just a joke.
<p></p>It seemed to me that there <em>were</em> primarily unicorn guards in Canterlot (see Call of the Cutie,  Twilight's section),  pegasi is just what's convenient for Celestia to take away for visits. And we've only seen her visit Ponyville which is close to the capital anyway,  so she probably only takes a minimal amount of guards with her.

            To be honest,  it seems like if Celestia really did encounter something that was a threat to her,  she'd throw down personally anyway.  If chess has taught me anything,  it's to respect the Queen - even if she is a Princess.

            Well,  there're differing levels of formality.  It's pretty clear in "Bird in the Hoof" that Celestia just wants to sit and talk with her subjects,  but everypony's extremely on edge and the guards are there,  because they have their own concept of 'informal with the Princess',  and it's basically 'formal'.  Celestia seems the most comfortable at the end of "The Best Night Ever",  when she manages to get away from everyone and gets to spend time with Twilight and her friends in the donut shop.

            My point is,  I very much doubt she insisted on the royal retinue accompanying her to Ponyville.  Her comfort seemed more like a matter of being able to relax and stop being the Princess for a bit rather than the fact that she was safe in Canterlot; the palace is visible from Ponyville,  and anything powerful enough to attack the Princess and actually pose a threat in Ponyville would definitely still pose a threat in Canterlot.

            If anything attacked that was dangerous enough to threaten her the guards wouldn't be any help,  but they're probably useful for keeping minor theats from bothering her.
<p></p>We did see her visit without any guards in Feeling Pinkie Keen.

            Spike looks so high in those comics.  There are a few new ones out,  in one of them the ponies want to go to the lake because it's really hot out,  but they're to tired to walk there.  So the decide the best solution is to <em>construct a water slide</em> to get them there,  as if that is somehow less work.
