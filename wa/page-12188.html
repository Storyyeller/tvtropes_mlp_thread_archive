            I liked this ep. Funny jokes and premise,  but the clones could've been disposed of a bit more humanely,  and Pinkie forgetting that she was the real one seems weird to me.

            I honestly found the whole "What If I'm not the real me?" thing interesting for two reasons:
<p></p>1. It's dead obvious that she's the real Pinkie,  which gives the whole thing some great irony.
<p></p>2. It shows that Pinkie's friends aren't the only one's who were affected negatively by her antics.  It gave her an identity crisis.  Which is really totally in character for her.  She wanted to have fun with her friends and ended up accomplishing entirely the opposite,  so she starts doubting herself.
<p></p>@Enlong: I sort of interpreted it as if someone created a computer program to imitate someone's voice.  It's not quite perfect,  and it doesn't really have any personality,  it's just a construct meant to look like something else. Only it's magic rather than a computer program.

            Also she totally wanted to "punish" the real Pinkie by making her join the clones in watching paint dry.

            Instead of watching paint dry,  would you think the test should've been something more direct toward her friends? Like,  fighting them and seeing which ones resisted?

            No,  I don't think so. Considering how hyperactive Pinkie is,  doing something that requires them to sit and watch without doing anything else is more the right thing to do.

            As soon as I noiced that the copy didn't know anything off the bat,  I immediately started equating them with <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalesOfTheAbyss">Replicas</a>. That made the test scene a good deal more disturbing,  to me.

            Anyway,  like I did last time,  let's write down the obvious Fanfic ideas from this episode.
<p></p><ul><li> More cloning,  with the other ponies. (Including the inevitable Rule 34 variants...)
<p></p></li><li> History of the mirror. (Possibly including Granny pie finding it.)
<p></p></li><li> The last Pinkie realising she was in fact a fake.
</li></ul><p></p>Hmm,  anything else?

            I guess one of the things that made the whole thing odd was that the way the Clones/Constructs/Facsimiles/whatever were behaving is pretty much how Pinkie would behave in any other episode. That's why I found the scene unnerving,  since to me it seemed like they could have quite easily banished the real one without them noticing. Oh,  well. At least it did leave the best one at the end.
<p></p>I wonder if the dark fics are being written now?
