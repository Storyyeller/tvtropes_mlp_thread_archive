            Well a lot of people seemed to just be staying by their presentations (and I was one of them,  XD) but I had two non-teacher people come to my table and look through the powerpoint,  plus my teacher and an assessor. Hopefully they'll try the show out xD

            About the issue of Blueblood being hated more than Chrysalis,  looking at what they each did objectively,  I personally think that Chrysalis is worse.  Blueblood merely annoyed and disappointed Rarity (and rejected Applejack's food) while Chrysalis locked Cadance in a crystal dungeon with no food or water,  impersonated her,  brainwashed her fiance and sent her army to terrorize an entire city (and that's disregarding what she does in the comics).
<p></p>However,  there are a few reasons I can think that many fans would see Blueblood's actions in a worse light than Chrysalis's.  One is probably that Blueblood's actions seem more real to viewers than Chrysalis's,  simply because the average real-life person is much more likely to have met a person who they admired who turned out to be a snob rather than a magical evil Queen who has magical brainwashing powers,  although Chrysalis's behavior when she was disguised as Cadance could also easily be something that could strike home for viewers as well (being rejected by someone you used to be friends with who has become not so nice over the years).  It may simply be easier to hate a character who reminds you (general you) of someone who you personally hate rather than someone whose crimes are unlikely to be recreated in the real world.
<p></p>Another is <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy">Evil Is Sexy</a> combined with the fact that Chrysalis is female (with there being many male bronies) and also very seductive.  She is also mentioned as feeding on love like a vampire feeds on blood,  and that gives her sympathy points with many fans who see her as only doing it to survive and then they imagine that she would be able to feed off of mutual love (and maybe imagine themselves fulfilling that role to her).  Prince Blueblood,  because he's male,  is not likely to appeal to heterosexual males in the same way (I have no idea if there are pony fans who are attracted to males,  such as gay males or heterosexual females,  who are also attracted to Prince Blueblood as a character as well).  Also,  his motivations for treating Rarity the way he did aren't mentioned at all,  while the fact that Chrysalis and the other changelings use love as some kind of food or energy source is mentioned on the show.  Needing something for food is a motivation that typically generates sympathy in others,  which is another point in Chrysalis's favor.

            @Librarian: Glad to hear that it went well.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I agree that Chrysalis is way worse than Blueblood,  but she's also far more interesting than he is.  Chrysalis gets treated better because more people are willing to take the time to explore the character more,  whereas Blueblood wasn't really intriguing enough for people to bother making more content about him.

            Really Rich Burloew summed it up when discussing Xycon.
<p></p><em>Writing a story centered around your main antagonist is sort of difficult,  because you risk "devillainifying" them. Yes,  I just made that word up. What I mean though,  is that once an audience has read all about a character's life,  with all of their personal struggles and trials and tribulations and such,  it's more difficult to see the character as the Big Bad. My challenge here was to tell the story of Xykon's life without making Xykon even slightly sympathetic. I mean,  he's wholly and unapologetically Evil,  but more to the point,  <strong>he's kind of a dick</strong>.</em>
<p></p>notice the bolded part.
<p></p>That's really the issue. yes Chrysalis was EVIL,  but blueblood,  was just a dick. People would understand or at least theorize why Chysalis was doing what she was,  deeding her children etc... needing love. Bueblood,  was just a douche for the sake of being a douche.

            Plus Chrysalis's actions were about her survival. Yes,  it involved pretty much destroying a whole city,  imprisoning the inhabitants and enslaving them,  but she only did so out of either desperation or hunger.
<p></p>Blueblood's just a knobface.

            Chrysalis is just more interesting as a character,  which is one of many ways to get a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">a nice pair of leather pants</a>.
