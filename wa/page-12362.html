            Bear in mind that in that series,  alicorns are <em>weird</em> and that that kind of power is standard issue for them. Luna and Cadance are about as powerful (though Cadance has forgottn how to use most of her powers). And there are characters who are <em>far</em> more powerful than them.
<p></p>And yeah,  I don't agree with them having that kind of ower either. I'm just pointing out that my interpretation is actually rather conservative compared to some.
<p></p>EDIT: The sun has a mass of 333000 times that of Earth. Celestia should be ables to crush Earth to dust with a thought.

            Sorry,  Sereg,  but I think that's kind of ridiculous. =|  I agree that Celestia is crazy powerful; I'm with Ace in preferring her power level in <em>The Song Of Syhlex</em>,  in which she assumes her aspect and glasses an ancient dragon magelord and his seven sons,  and most of the surrounding area,  just by standing there.  (I actually like the explanation that she was holding back; given Celestia,  she might not have many options above that beam that wouldn't kill Chrysalis and/or cause collateral damage).  Still,  deciding she can pulverize the planet with a thought feels like too much to me; I'm sure she could do it if she <em>tried</em>,  but something about it feels wrong both for what she is and who she is.

It's obviously not meant to imply that she has telekinesis powerful enough to actually move an object as dense and huge as the sun.

            The Princess would not want to raise the sun directly on top of her subjects just to turn Chrysalis into carbonized ashes.
<p></p>In any case,  ponies have better naturally (magic augmented) physiology,  but humans have a more matured tech base and are better at fighting in all other aspects.

            @Blue: Yeah,  that's my take on it.  We still can't say for sure whether or not the Princesses <em>actually</em> lift their celestial bodies with something as simple as telekinesis,  whether it's a specialized spell,  whether it happens just by them willing it... not to mention that,  as Death said,  we don't know how big or far away the sun is.
<p></p>Let's face it; if she's that powerful,  she could do whatever the fuck she wanted to anyone.  She wouldn't need the Elements of Harmony and she surely wouldn't have sent Cadence,  Shining Armor and her star pupil to deal with some rock-obsessed jackass she could literally starblast off the northern side of the planet.
<p></p>Edit: Unless it takes two solar-system-crushing-level alicorns to seal away one mortal unicorn who got into the dark magic books.

<p></p>As much I prefer Sci Fi over fanstasy I'm not fan of putting to much science in magical setting.
<p></p>In other news,   after listening to  One Bad Apple over hundred times  I put it as best song in season so far,  and songs from opening episodes were great.

            Yes,  Sombra and Chrysalis were <em>even more powerful than Celestia</em>. I don't see why this is an issue at all.
<p></p>And yes,  Isee Celestia movingthe sun as the show showing us that Celestia telekinetically moves around an object <em>identical</em> to our sun with barely any effort!

<p></p>Not true. Twilight informs us that the constellations are identical to our own. Meaning that Equestrian Earth is n the same point in space as our Earth,  which means that we can reasonably extrapolate that the solar system contains the same bodies as well.
<p></p>The thing that there sn't any proof of is that it's any different from our Sun (apart from the fact that Celestia moves it around).
<p></p>All the attempts to show Celestia as weaker than I claimed are based on her ffights with thers which simply show them as powerful rather than her as weak.

<p></p>And trivial for the alicorns to deal with as well. So there we go. I don't think he's <em>much</em> stronger than Celestia. And she had Luna's help. So Sombra gets his flank kicked.
