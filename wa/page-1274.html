            I don't get anyone can have against Pinkie. She's a fun girl. If she'd be worrying about people's feeling instead she'd be Fluttershy.
<p></p>FYI let me rant about the Halloween episode a bit,  because people asked and I think the patting each other on the back over not hating on new!Luna may have died down by now. (I swear,  the anticipation for fanrage was waay worse than anything that actually happened. It's sad because it's like people were looking forward to unleash themselves on those who didn't like canon!Luna in the name of love and friendship. Oh,  yee errant fanboys.)
<p></p>I thought the episode was very unsatisfying. Not badly done; just...Unremarkable.
<p></p>Pip could've been a good character (people were really pumped up to see him) but I agree with what someone else already said some pages back,  that if they were only going to do only so much with him there was no need to create a new character,  and if they did,  he should've have been more unique and likeable. As it was,  he was more of a moutpiece for the plot than how I was able to accept that a person would actually act.
<p></p>Luna,  oh Luna. Or maybe there is some hidden joke here with the Voice and the royal behavior that I'd have to be UK-born to "get",  but the "large ham" and "tolerance for the scary" shtick was already done a lot better with Trixie and Zecora. I wanted there to be more to her personality.
<p></p>Now,  my other concern about her is not as much a complaint as a concern. Good!Luna scares me more than Discord did.
She's basically Nightmare Moon reformed. So I'm afraid that now since she's by far the darkest character around,   she'll be too scary for a children's show,  and will be used max once every season. I can see her living in the old castle rather than Canterlot,  too. (Maybe there'll be a Hasbro set for it,  too.) And I really do not want more "sympathy for the dark sister" episodes. When it is done with Zecora,  it seems like a reasonable lesson about tolerance. I do not know what there is to gain from it in this case.
<p></p>I'm aware that there is nothing that enough fansplaining couldn't make work (like the "thousand years old yet doesn't have a single friend/never had fun" thing,  which also bothered me a bit),  and I know that this is "good enough" for kids who are exposed for cartoons for the first time. I really don't get the adult viewer's reactions,  though.

I thought she was better as a character than Fanon!Luna ever was. I never get tired of Large Hams either,  so I didn't have the same fatigue problems that you seemed to have.
<p></p>Pip was pointless,  but not distractingly so,  so he didn't bother me.
<p></p>She's already friends with everyone in ponyville,  so I don't think we'll be seeing more episodes like this one.

<p></p>Luna is more than welcome to show up more in s2 and the almost-inevitable s3. Her complex canon personality is something I want more of.

<p></p>People who don't worry about others feelings are the <em>least</em> qualified to entertain others. Only wanting to have fun without worrying about others comes off as jerkassishness in my opinion. But as I said,  she's grown on me a lot.
<p></p>As for the episode,  that's opinion so YMMV. Personally,  I found it incredibly entertaining and that's the reason I'm watching,  so I consider it one of the better episodes.

            I didn't think that Luna was really scary,  except for maybe her entrance scene.  And I like the fact that she's basically "Nightmare Moon reformed"; it makes more sense for their personalities to be similar than for Luna to be a completely different character.  It's much more entertaining,  though.
<p></p>I agree about Pip,  though (I think I might have been the person who first brought this up).  He's not a bad character,  but I just found him sort of gratuitous.  They go to the trouble of introducing him as somebody who's new to the town,  but they don't really do anything with it that they couldn't have done with another character.

<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Agreed completely. As for Pip,  I <em>hope</em> they do something with him,  because he has potential and is cute,  but this episode,  he wasn't particularly necessary. A CMC could have sufficed.

            Appearing in anothers dream is creepy only if done so. Hell,  how fun would it be to be lucid dreaming <em>and</em> having a friend over your crazy dream?
<p></p>EDIT: Assuming that <em>if</em> Luna would have appeared in someponys dreams,  they would have regarded the whole thing as that: a dream. It's like someone would never remember meeting you,  even if you have many times. That or ponies don't remember dreams too well. So Luna would have been in a cycle of being forgotten the whole time.

            I can sorta agree with Vree; I enjoyed "Luna Eclipsed",  but it doesn't have quite the same zing as some of the best episodes.  Then again,  not everything can be Totally Awesome,  and there's nothing wrong with going low-key for a bit (especially after how the first three episodes of the season went all over the emotional spectrum).
<p></p>And I definitely don't get the anti-Pinkie hate.  She might be a bit oblivious at times,  but she never has ill intent towards anypony.  If Pinkie had known that Luna was getting upset at everyone screaming at the sight of her,  she'd be the <em>first</em> to organize a "Hooray Luna is The Bestest Princess" party.
<p></p>As for Luna,  I expect any future appearances from her will be limited to cameos with a handful of lines,  probably similar to Celestia but with Ye Olde Worlde English thrown in.
<p></p>Finally,  despite what some fans think,  I <em>don't</em> think Pip's part in "Luna Eclipsed" could've been replaced by anyone,  <em>especially</em> not the Cutie Mark Crusaders. If the CMC were featured in this story,  we'd eat up 10 minutes of air time with Scootaloo trying to fight Princess Luma,  Sweetie Belle lamenting the end of Nightmare Night,  and Applebloom trying to form the CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS CANDY CHAMPIONS or somesuch... taking time away from Twilight's attempts to solve the problem. Instead,  Pipsqueak comes in,  establishes himself as a Nightmare Night newbie,  tells Luna that being scared is part of the fun,  and the story avoids being derailed by the CMC's schtick.
