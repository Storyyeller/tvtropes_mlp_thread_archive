            Y'see,  here's the slight problem I have with people instantly jumping on "stage magician."
<p></p>By all indications in the dialogue,  she's just a unicorn who's prancing about proclaiming herself better. I think there's a fair amount of taking the <em>aesthetic</em> of the stage magician and taking that to mean,  at face value,  "oh,  she's a stage magician."
<p></p>I know the last time I did this someone jumped on me for "claiming that the stage magician isn't a stage magician, " but look at it this way - the show uses the aesthetic and the trappings of the stage show - someone pretends to do magic,  but they really aren't,  as a sort of foreshadowing - Trixie is claiming to be an immensely powerful magic-user,  but she isn't. Just a bunch of pyrotechnics.
<p></p>If she was just being presented as a stage magician,  it wouldn't be pushing the idea that she was a fraud (and the episode does push that).
<p></p>Like I said - Harold Hill.

            It isn't like you need a permit or something to be a magician.  She has a stage,  and she's performing magic for a crowd.  All her dialogue is what you'd expect from a magician ("come one,  come all,  come and witness the amazing magic" etc.)  Even if she is doing it solely for the attention,  that doesn't make her not a magician.  It isn't like they're immune to being egotistical.  Hell,  Chris Angel gives me the impression that he's more stuck up his own ass than Trixie could ever be.

            I found a REALLY terrific spanish fansub of the first episode! And the adaptation was really good! The only weird(Not bad just weird) that it Translated Big (Gran) Machintosh,  Granny(Abuela) Smith and these are apple names and no one else got their name translated,  only explained in a Translation Note Except Rainbow Dash,  Rarity and Pinkie Pie whose names were not explained (Rainbow=Arcoiris Dash=Impulso Rarity=Rareza Pinkie=Rosita).Oh and the Wonderbolts (Relampagos,  This one is a Woolseysm,  correctly said it would be Relampagos Maravilla).
<p></p>Oh and it handled Everypony and Anypony satisfactorily,  too!

            I don't see why it should be necessary to warn if you're linking human versions of the cast. It's not like the pictures are violent,  vulgar,  NSFW or generally offensive. If the picture does happen to be one of the above than yes,  warn,  but if human versions of the characters offend you to the point where you absolutely can't stand to see it than you seriously need to lighten up.

<p></p>I'm still always surprised whenever I see human fluttershy. To me yellow is such a dominating colour and when I picture her all I think of is yellow,  so seeing her with pink hair (I know that's her mane colour) and no yellow on her at all is kinda weird

            I don't really have an opinion on the second set of humanized fanart; I liked delinquent!Rarity,  though,  but that was the only part that I did like.
<p></p>^How much you like Gilda really depends on whether you view her behavior as immature and jealous or knowingly possessive,  I think.  She's a huge jerk in ways that don't have anything to do with Rainbow Dash,  but I suppose it all depends on whether her attempted redemption was due to her actually having something to redeem inside her or just an attempt made for the episode's Aesop.

            I don't whant to see Gilda redemption episode. This show and RD do not need her. We have Spitfire who is similar but minus part making her unlikeable (and she is pony but being griphon wasn't problem).

            ^^Spitfire's not anything like Gilda,  not really.  And I'm not saying Gilda should become a permanent member of the cast,  either; she just has potential to become better than she was,  like Trixie (who should also perhaps make a return in S2).  We'll find out... but I do want to write that fic,  I think.  Maybe.

            I think Gilda should at least leave RD on good terms. Even if they don't become friends again,  Gilda does care for RD (even if it's mostly posessive) That's a trait none of the other jerks in this show have,  and they do seem to have fun when their together
