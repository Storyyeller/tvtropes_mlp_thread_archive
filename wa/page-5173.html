            Parents do it all the time you know.  Let a kid wander off on their own but follow discreetly... waiting to swoop in if something does go wrong.  Its how kids explore the world.
<p></p>The ponies were acting as Spike's parents,  allowing him to discover things for himself but being there for whatever may happen.  Spike is a child and no adult in their right mind would let a child go off into a dangerous situation without some sort of safety net.

            Well ideally the kid doesn't <em>notice</em>.
<p></p>I don't think my parents did either,  but it was probably something simple. Just roaming off to play wit the parents watching in the background. This is a pretty large scale thing,  but eh.
<p></p>It's not like we can really expect you to become comfortable with it. Some things bug people. But it wasn't really disrespect,  just concern. They do give him respect... though not necessarily in the way he'd like.

            Kids don't need respect,  they need support and guidance.
<p></p>Anyway,  the trend seems to continue: I figured I wouldn't like this episode,  ended up loving it (aside from a few parts that were painfully corny,  anyway).  Great soundtrack too,  I don't if I just noticed it more cause I was listening to headphones or what.  I bet the music guys had fun producing a metal My Little Pony track.
<p></p>Anyway,  I've got a lot of work to do so I don't think I can actually talk about the episode today... See ya.

<p></p>Exactly.  Twilight and everyone else assumed that Spike would be in over his head,  and it turned out that he kinda was.  As for the fact that he's on his own a lot of the time,  he certainly is,  but he's in <em>Ponyville</em>,  where everyone is maybe kind of a jerk at worst.  They might not know much about dragons,  but "dragons are dangerous" isn't exactly a bad assumption to make.
<p></p>TL;DR they decided that Spike's safety was more important than his sense of empowerment.

<p></p>Also,  I think the reason that Rarity's costume was so atrocious is because she had to make it in a rush.  I mean,  if they had to follow Spike they didn't have long to throw it together.

            Yeah,  it's not like Rarity to make stuff that bad looking,  but then again,  her dress was quite atrocious too.  Maybe she just needs whatever the fashion equivalent of a good editor is?

<p></p>Well,  considering that they only had about five minutes of prep time before hitting the road,  she actually did pretty well.  Although I think the balloon is a bit conspicuous if you're following a bunch of dragons.
