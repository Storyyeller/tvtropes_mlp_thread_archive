            Yeah,  if nothing else the good and the bad is an oil and water situation. Some will seep through,  but for the most part it's very seperate,  so you can ignore the worst of it.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_down.png" alt="[down]" title="[down]" height="16" width="16">Well,  that's rather the point. It's never been that the show itself doesn't like AJ,  she's regularly shown to be the most competant and stable of the girls. It's the fandom ignoring her that's the problem.

            Gah,  I missed a bunch of stuff while I was at work.  Here's my 2 cents on everything:
<p></p><strong>Art stuff</strong>: My basic attitude towards my own writing is summed up with this quote: "<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CSLewis" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CSLewis">I wrote the books I should have liked to read,  if only I could have got them. That's always been my reason for writing.</a>"  Specifically,  the reason I enjoy writing is the idea of putting something together that isn't already out there.  The whole "pandering to fans" mentality bugs be because most of the time it crops up,  it's in the form of "why can't you make it more like this other thing?",  to which my reply is usually "because we already <em>have</em> this other thing and I don't want to just make it again".  That isn't to say that an author should ever totally disregard the fans (the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a> prequels are a good example of what can happen in that situation),  but at the same time,  the author shouldn't be totally subject to the whims of the fans either.  There needs to be balance; namely that the author takes the fan's desires into consideration and ultimately choose to whether or not to go with it based on what's best for the story.  I don't see anything wrong with throwing fanservice in,  but I don't think you should ever do that to the detriment of the story (like if it creates a plot hole or makes a character OOC)
<p></p><strong>Discworld</strong>: I've been meaning forever to start reading these.  To those who have read them: What's the best place to get started reading the series?  There's like a zillion books and I want to start at a logical place.
<p></p><strong>DMOS</strong>: I don't really care for the fact that it exists and I wouldn't mind seeing it go,  but it's certainly better to keep all that crap over there than in this thread.  No matter how well-received an episode is,  there's always going to be <em>somebody</em> that doesn't like it.
<p></p><strong>Derpy and AJ</strong>: Yeah,  it's unfortunate that the fandom focused so much on the Derpy scene,  but on the other hand,  it's pretty cool that the writers wanted to acknowledge the fans like that.  All the complaining about "OMG Derpy didn't exactly match how I thought of her!" bugs me as well; the people who made the show pretty much made that scene as a way of showing that they care about the fanbase,  so all the bitching about how it's not exactly what they wanted just strikes me as a bit ungrateful.  Looking a gift horse in the mouth,  so to speak.  I'm also a bit confused by the "Derpy is offensive!" camp as well; I didn't get an "mentally challenged" vibes from the scene.  Watching it we know that she has a dopey voice,  and she's clumsy.  Neither of those things necessarily imply that she's mentally challenged,  just that she's a klutz with a speech impediment.  If anything assuming that she's retarded based solely on her voice and clumsiness does a disservice to anyone in Real Life who's clumsy and has an odd voice but is otherwise normal.  It's just making a mountain out of a molehill.
<p></p>And as far as the spotlight stealing,  I honestly expected it to be a lot worse.  And AJ is getting another episode next week anyway,  so that should help her a lot.
<p></p><strong>Clopfics</strong>: I don't mind that they exist,  I just prefer that people keep that kind of thing to themselves,  mainly because it doesn't exactly reflect well on the fandom (I realize it's true of other fandoms as well,  but bronies seem to be more in the public eye),  but also out of respect for the fans that don't like seeing the characters sexualized to that degree.
<p></p><strong>Memes</strong>: Mild stuff like Trollestia doesn't bug me too much as long as it's kept separate from canon.  Some of those jokes can be genuinely funny.  My only issue is when people start applying to canon,  where it just doesn't fit.  Pure shock value things like Sweetie Poo and Sweet Apple Massacre can die in a fire.  I've never liked <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInVulgarity" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInVulgarity">Refuge In Vulgarity</a>.
<p></p>Okay,  I probably missed some stuff,  but this is long enough as is and I have to go to dinner.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            Bringing up a topic for discussion!
<p></p>Drinking Bawls Guarana Cherry (can't believe the stuff exists),  and I can't help but think that this drink would fit Pinkie Pie (as far as both purpose and taste goes - for taste alone,  I'd think Fluttershy might be a nice fit).
<p></p>So this has me thinking: what non-alcoholic drinks do you think fit ponies?

            Yup. Awesome AJ episode with great Pinkie exploitables and a nod to the fandom nobody would have <em>ever</em> expected (Well,  it's not like I told it was going to happen :p),  something that very few shows ever displayed.
<p></p>It's just that Derpy (and Whooves) are my favorites background ponies,  so it really hit home to have her speak :D. Then a bunch of wild haters appears. <em>Let the hunt begin *take shotgun*</em>
