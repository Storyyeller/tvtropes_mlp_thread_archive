            Fair point about the others going against their elements. It just bugged me to see Applejack do it for some reason.

            But she <em>did</em> want to try something new. She didn't want to go back home. Again,  not lying. Telling a truth that you know will be misinterpreted - or at least assume. Not a lie,  a misdirection. Still technically honest.

She's probably the most consistent pony out of the cast in how she reflects her element,  so it's more jarring when she goes against it.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I still think it counts as deception though; she wants the other ponies to believe something that isn't true.  It's not a <em>lie</em> per se,  but the opposite of honesty isn't necessarily the act of lying.

If Rainbow Dash had tried that,  the other ponies might have anticipated it.
<p></p>They weren't being stupid so much as they just didn't expect Applejack to attempt to trick them because she practically never does that.

            To be fair she'd never wanted to answer them at all. But they insisted on an answer,  so she simply told them what they wanted to hear. I still say it isn't a true lie,  and one can be ultimately honest while still deceiving and misdirecting. In fact,  honesty is often the easiest way to deceive someone. Tell them a truth they won't believe,  and they're in the palm of your hand...

            Many may take it as such,  but by strict definition,  it isn't. She's still telling the truth,  after all,  just a truth that she knows they'll interpret differently. If anyone is going to be a stickler to definition,  it's the element of honesty.

            @Keg: What definition of "honest" are you using?  Because as far as I know,  being honest and actively attempting to deceive someone are mutually exclusive.  She's not lying,  but she's knowingly tricking someone into believing a falsehood.  She's trying to get them to believe that she's only working for Cherry because she wants a change of pace,  when that isn't the truth.  Hence,  she's trying to get them to believe a falsehood (that she has no ulterior motive),  hence she's being dishonest.

            That's not the kind of honesty that fosters friendship,  that's just rules-lawyering.
<p></p>We should probably be clearer on how we're using our terminologies,  for the purposes of this particular discussion.

            @Ginger: To be fair "back where you began" could be interpreted any number of different ways.  Twilight's actually kinda lucky she figured it out.
<p></p>Also,  just to note the definition of "honesty" that I'm using is something along the lines of "is always forthright about the actual state of things".
