It's fairly well known in the U.S.,  although I don't know how popular it is elsewhere.
<p></p>Re: Biggest jerk:
<p></p>Gilda is probably the most willfully jerkish.  Trixie was extremely arrogant,  but she did have a good amount of skill; it was just that her inflated opinion of herself bypassed the limits of her actual abilities. Blueblood was a jerk,  but he wasn't a malicious jerk in the same way that Gilda was; all the annoyance that he caused was just a byproduct of his selfishness; he wasn't <em>trying</em> to hurt people.  Gilda was obviously hostile to Pinkie Pie and a good number of other ponies for no good reason.

            I rank Gilda as a Jerk Ass of Jerk asses. The episode she's in says it all about her. How did RD end up with such a loser for a former friend???
<p></p>Trixie...is just a pathetic,  one-note strawwoman who thinks she's God at what she does. There's nothing more sad than running into someone in real life like that who thinks themselves a Mary Sue/Gary Stu. Sad,  indeed.
<p></p>Who cares about Blood's-his-name? Another worthless strawman that Rarity stupidly fondled over. More Proof she should get with Spike (I'm kidding,  even thoguh I'd love to see Spike,  even if that means him being with someone too old/mature for him. I say this because Spike is my Favorite character on this show BTW and I like seeing him happy as it wrms my dark soul ablaze).

            I really want to know why Celestia lets her nephew get away with being such a massive tool.  That seems strangely neglectful of her.

Based on the assholes from Sonic Rainboom and Cutie Mark Chronicles I could see them both being social outcasts when they were younger.

It'd hopefully make for some interesting storytelling. Even if I NEVER want to see Gilda again. I hate her character that much...As much as any character we're labeling as Jerk Asses around here.

            The reason I really didn't like Gilda (other than being a huge enough bitch to make Fluttershy cry) was because of her really cliche <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">Totally Radical</a> style of speech.

            In jerk order,  Gilda,  Blueblood,  and Trixie. Gilda was intentionally cruel—trying to get rid of Pinkie,  who was trying to include her right away. Pranking a senior. Stealing stuff. Bullying Fluttershy. Hitting a little kid (Spike). Blueblood was self-centred,  and walked all over Rarity and insulted Applejack's treats. Trixie,  to her credit,  only went after those who "challenged" her and did try to get rid of the Ursa. That being said,  I'd love to see Trixie vs. Gilda!
