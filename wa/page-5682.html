            also,  keep in mind,  every time we saw the CMC approach another pony after they were uncovered,  it was explicitly to try and get a new story out of them. The other ponies might have not reacted quite so badly if it wasn't for that.

            Yeah,  the force field was definitely overkill.  Like I said,  I thought the general reaction to the CMC was too harsh; yeah they did some nasty stories but they're kids.

            People are really taking things too seriously on both sides.
<p></p>The town didn't treat them that badly.  All they did was give them the cold shoulder for like <em>one day, </em> and pour some rain on them (just RD).
<p></p>The CMC didn't do much either,  its not like any of the things they published were awful secrets,  all it did was cause some embarrassment.

            Wait,  now we have Celestia posting on this forum? Oh boy.
<p></p>As for the characters shunning the CMC,  I can understand why they would do that. The CMC went to some pretty deep lengths to get the "juicy stories" that they needed to get. Then again,  the harshness of the characters' cold shoulders is coupled by their quick forgiveness in the end. So,  I'm not complaining.

<p></p>This episode was probably my favorite so far. Great animation and BGM,  and it managed to make me both happy and sad. All the continuity nods were nice as well. The only problem I have is the intro makes Sweetie Belle and Scootloo seem incapable of functioning without Applebloom. Is that all they did before Diamond Tiara's <strike> mark mitzvah</strike> cute-cenara?

            Eh,  I still think it would have flowed better if the reaction was toned down a little.  I mean Twilight doing something like blocking off the library entirely over something like that is kinda OOC for her.   The other thing is that there's no way the CMC wrote embarrassing stuff on literally <em>everyone</em> in the town.

            @ginger For a second I thought you said she was OP,  which makes sense. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16"> I dunno,  she didn't have many,  if any,  friends before she came to Ponyville,  so she's probably a bit sensitive to being portrayed as a snob.
