            I agree with Blissey. Though I'll add that she didn't care much about the other side.
<p></p>Still,  yeah. In Zebrica,  it was eternal day.
<p></p>And also annoying due to the increased heat.

<p></p>Hmmm... Good question. Celestia's probably quite high here. So is Rarity. Fluttershy would normally be lower but her moe and her stare are quite the trump cards. Pinkie might be considered low due to her annoyangness,  but her ability to use it to her advantage,  her manipulativeness and her ability to make others happy gives her a big boost. Twilight has the advantage of background and a gift for beurocracy.
<p></p>Hmm... Tough call.

            @Sereg: I'd question the "has control over a certain concept as well",  outside of the "certain ponies have affinities for certain skillsets".  I personally don't think Celestia's connection to the sun is any stronger than Rarity's connection to gems,  or Applejack's connection to apples. Yes,  it's an important part of their identity,  but it doesn't define their set of abilities.
<p></p>But anyway,  yeah,  Celestia probably has an absurd amount of diplomatic skill.  A thousand years of learning how to read people can't hurt.
<p></p>Twilight: Was probably below average at the start of the series,  but probably around average at the moment.
<p></p>Applejack: A bit above average. She must be a decent salesmare.
<p></p>Rainbow Dash: Awful,  for obvious reasons
<p></p>Fluttershy: Also awful,  for the exact opposite reason as Rainbow Dash.  RD would suck at compromising,  whereas Fluttershy would be far too willing to compromise
<p></p>Rarity: Probably pretty good.  She's pretty good at socializing.
<p></p>Pinkie: I have no clue.  For all we know she could be the best or worst out of the bunch.

            I'd guess it's more complicated than simple diplomacy levels: there's several different types or schools of diplomacy,  with different cast members having different specialties.
<p></p>Twilight is intelligent and very logical,  so she's going to be very effective with any party who respects those traits. Rarity is a master of the "disarm the other party by complimenting them" technique. Rainbow Dash is definitely more skilled with intimidation than traditional diplomacy,  but I'm sure her skills would come in handy in dealing with some Proud Warrior Race.

I personally don't think Celestia's connection to the sun is any stronger than Rarity's connection to gems,  or Applejack's connection to apples. Yes,  it's an important part of their identity,  but it doesn't define their set of abilities. </div>
<p></p>Right. It's just headcanon anyway. Of course,  I think that Rarity's talent is "finding and creating beauty" rather than "finding gems",  but yeah.
<p></p>Also,  you make good points on the diplomatic levels.

            Yes. Plus,  her Jump is probably through the roof already.
<p></p>Hm... it occurs to me that,  if doing 4th edition,  Applejack would probably have as high an Athletics score as allowed,  and Dash would instead have a maxxed Acrobatics. Each would still have a high score in the other,  though.

            @Sereg: Yeah,  I agree with that take on Rarity's talent.  My point is that just because Celestia has a sun for a cutie mark doesn't necessarily mean that she has complete and utter control over all things sun-related.
<p></p>And I have very little knowledge of D&amp;D,  so I have nothing to contribute now. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

<p></p>Actually,  I agree. I don't think she does. More like if it's possible to do something related to the sun,  Celestia probably knows how to do it bynow or at the very least can learn fairly easily.
<p></p>Also,  quick explanation: Diplomacy is a skill you can use to convince people to become friendly orin exreme cases,  willing to die for you. There's a way of substituting other skills to have the same effect. Substituting <em>jump</em> is the most famous,  but their are many hilarious examples.

<p></p>Autohypnosis: If I convince myself I have friends,  I will!
<p></p>Knowledge (Nature): I know so much about nature that people love me!
