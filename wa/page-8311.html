<p></p>Exactly! They were thriving on each other's attention. And if anypony is okay with interspecies romance,  it's Fluttershy.
<p></p>Also,  checked the new Lunaverse fic. Looking good.

            @Sereg I think they don't. You can see by some faces Cheerilee face in that episode that she is tired of people,  friend or family,  asking them about a boyfriend and maybe over and over. Maybe she's gay. Maybe just didn't find The One. Maybe both things.
<p></p>The episode is funny because of the kids knowing so little about adult world.

            They've mainly teased Lyrabon on account of being so popular in the fandom. I only hope that they don't have Vinyl Scratch and Octavia show up next to each other.
<p></p>My favorite background pairing is Daisy/Colton. Totally canon - they show up with each other all the time.

            meh I doubt they'd even bring relationships up at all just to avoid it,  H&HD was the exception since can't have a V-Day episode without it.
<p></p>and they have GOT to be smart enough to avoid putting the Mane 6 into one unless it was something that was clearly limited to a single episode had a damn good reason.

            They've generally avoided relationships,  as per Lauren Faust's original intentions. Hearts & Hooves day is an exception,  and even then that was really only a ship tease in the end.
<p></p>Maaaan all the butthurt Fluttermac shippers. Embarrassing.
