            I'm still stumped about how to set up the starting premise of my game.
<p></p>Basically since even before Celstia can remember there has a been a magical wall at the edge of the lands of equestria,  it has come to be known as the edge of the world as not even the god ponies can penetrate it.
<p></p>For some reason Dash has to go there
AJ has got a story reason to leave ponyville and to the last known settlement (she is transporting some supplies)
I can see Celestia sending Twilight to investigate the wall to see if the Element of Magic can discover anything of use
And if 3 are going should all 6,  and if all 6 why? Rairity i suppose could be with AJ,  heading to the same town for rare supplies but fluttershy? Pinkie Pie? Celestia know if they left Pinky Pie behind we might end up with Cupcakes comming true with the rest of ponyville by the time they get back.

            Pretty sure wood and metal are part of the Chinese elemental lineup.
<p></p>If we're throwing light and dark in there,  I'd give them to Celestia and Luna.  I don't think dark really fits Trixie,  since she isn't really evil or associated with night.  If you're allowed to double up on elements,  I'd probably give her and Rainbow Dash lightning,  since both are flashy showoffs.

            actually it was more of a context thing i'm giving Dark to Trixie.
<p></p>I'm going to have Trixie be a reincarnation of Nightmare Moon. She's like Nightmare moon's evil filtered through the light of the elements of harmony,  making a new pony who's a jerk,  but not out and out EVIL. I was going to have her embrace the elemental force of darkness as a last resort to defeat the Mane cast with their elements. The existing evil of Nightmare Moon would combine with Raw darkness and bring Nightmare moon back at full power,  using Trixie as a host instead of Luna

            I don't think you really need any elaborate reasons for everypony to go.  They are all Elements of Harmony after all,  it would make sense for Celestia to send all of them.  Trying to give all of them a unique motive for making the trip might just bog down your opening.

            I personally find it hard to believe it took Celestia <em>a thousand years</em> to find just the right ponies.

            Well the element of magic is like Captain Planet.  You need the other five elements to make it appear.  Still,  if you need a reason for everypony,  I'd suggest Rarity going for some rare gems that are only found in that area.  Fluttershy could be interested in the local wildlife,  but would never have the courage to go on her own.  As for Dash,  maybe the Wonderbolts are putting on a show there.  You said that AJ is delivering supplies.  And Pinkie...  I don't know.  Maybe she just wanted to tag along?  I could see her going with the rest just so as not to feel left out.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">We still don't know what the deal is with the stars aiding in her escape.  Maybe Celestia found dozens of groups over the years that would have worked,  but she had to wait until whatever it was let her out of the moon.

            What do youthink of my games Cold Open
<p></p>MLP LAD
<p></p>Act 1: Rainbow Dash
<p></p>Dear Princess Celestia, 
As per your request I have made it to outer colony of Trottingham to investigate the World's Edge. To my surprise my friends,  the other Elements of Harmony,  (and me Spike!),  joined me for the journey. Rarity had been meaning to come to Trottingham for some time to get some newer fabrics to experiment with while Applejack,  much to my surprise said she had business out here as well,  and it was not Sweet Apple Acres business. It seems she had saved the fragments of Nightmare Moon when we purified her,  they were a strange material and incredibly heavy,  but a pony by the name of Iron Forge said he might be able to do something constructive with them. The problem was that to get them out of the castle Applejack needed the help of her entire family so transporting them halfway across the world has always been something a low priority. When she learned the rest of us were headed this way she asked if we could help transport the good,  and we agreed. Fluttershy was curious about the Trottingham wildlife,  and Dash said the Wonderbolts were giving training lessons to the Pegasi of Trottingham. Pinkie Pie insisted on coming along to make sure we had fun,  so I got to undertake this journey with my friends,  for which I am eternally grateful.
Dash and I have just reached the World's End,  the others busy in town so I will begin studying it immediately and spike will keep you up to date.
<p></p>Your Faithful Student, 
Twilight Sparkle.
<p></p>“Ok Spike you can send it now.” The violet unicorn nodded as she finished her dictation.
<p></p>Spike,  the purple dragon,  rolled up the scroll and in a puff of green fire it vanished.
<p></p>Rainbow Dash  moved left and right,  tilting her head her and there,  “So this is the end of the world huh?” she said pawing at the field of black energy that rose as high as she could see,  and yet it seemed to have a tangible end just beyond the edge of her vision. “I could just fly over it.”
<p></p>Twilight Sparkle moved over to her friend and looked up,  pulling a small book magically from her saddle bag,  “Other Pegasi have tried, ” she related as she read,  “It's some kind of illusion,  it seems to end but the higher you go,  the higher it goes. I don't think flying is going to cut it.”
<p></p>Rainbow Dash smiled cockily,  “No other Pegasus has been me! Watch I’ll go find out for you!”
<p></p>“Dash wait!” Twilight called out as the rainbow maned unicorn shot straight up.
<p></p>“You know even the violet dragons could never break the barrier, ” Spike mused in a unusual moment of reflection,  “My grandfather once tried though.”
<p></p>Twilight looked to her friend,  “Really” she said intrigued as she leafed through the book,  “I don't see any mention of dragons in here.”
<p></p>Spike got quiet,  “We aren't very...talkative with non dragons about our history.”
<p></p>“This has something to do with the Dragon Civil War doesn't it?” Twilight raid raising a brow.
<p></p>Spike gasped,  “How did you?”
<p></p>“We have met a few dragons,  and your all not the same. You don't even get along with each other in some cases,  it just made sense.”
<p></p>After a moment Spike nodded in shame,  “We dragons aren't as...united...as I would like.” the sorrow in his voice could be cut with a sword.
<p></p>“I can see it!” Rainbow Dash called out excitedly,  “Just a little higher!”
<p></p>It was true Dash saw something just past the edge of the barrier,  and so she ascended but it was hardly close,  rising higher and higher,  faster and faster she grunted,  'No stupid magic barrier is going to best Rainbow Dash!'
<p></p>As she picked up speed and focused it happened,  for one brief instant Rainbow Dash saw a ocean on the other side of the barrier,  what's more she saw a ship,  the figures on it indistinct but clearly they were fighting. And she was not about to sit idly by.
<p></p>The sky exploded in light high above Twilight Sparkle,  and the barrier seemed to flicker for only a brief moment,  in that moment Twilight Sparkle and Spike saw a boat on the ocean and a rainbow contrail rushing toward it before the wall once more became opaque.
<p></p>“Dash? Dash!” Twilight called,  Spike joining in a moment. “DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASH!”
<p></p>But there was only silence.

            Okay,  so working on Chapters 7,  8,  and 9 of my fic. Posted a bit of chapter nine of the previous page.
<p></p>Chapter 7 will focus to Constable Brownie,  8 will be about Phoenix and Kite,  and 9 you already saw some of.

            Should we perhaps spin off a separate topic for fanfics?  It seems like all of us asking for CC are getting drowned out by the people who just wanna talk about the show.
