            @perpetual I was trying to be general so it could be reusable I guess. Though in a sense,  E3 wasn't terrible as it were,  just developers are playing it very safe at the moment. So not a lot of reveals or new stuff,  I actually liked a lot of what Nintendo has in store,  though I am admittedly saddened at lack of word relating to anything coming out after 2012. That and even if the 3DS presentation was VERY light on news,  at least we got more footage and we know the 3DS is well supported for the rest of the year....but the vita....oh dear

            Secret of Nimh?
<p></p>Someone mentioned my favourite movie of all time?
<p></p>Oh man oh man,  I LOVED Secret of Nimh. I saw it for the first time in school after reading the book,  and it just... gah,  it's so amazing. I LOVE Mrs. Brisby,  I love how she's so tiny and scared and weak,  but she still fights her hardest. I think that was the movie that made me fall in love with animation,  actually.

            @ginger had Valve been at E3 with Half Life news,  you would of heard about it by now. So no. It was pretty much a washout bar one or two announcements as news goes. But I think this has an awful lot to do with shitty economy and mass over-reliance on a fickle casual market ect.

            Valve refuses to announce anything because they don't want to say <em>anything</em> until <em>everything</em> is set in stone. They actually got burned really bad by Half-Life 2 leaking,  so they're cracking down on details hard. Also,  Valve's corporate structure consists of "work on whatever interests you" so they're in no rush to complete anything and no desire to move additional people to the project. They have infinite money thanks to Steam,  so they get to do whatever they want.

            Yeah,  the pendant was... well,  it was a time saver. In the original book they solved the problem differently,  although I can't recall how.
<p></p>Also,  it's difficult to say what Valve is up to with <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HL3" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HL3">HL 3</a>. They're... odd,  as far as companies go.  But the smart money says they're polishing the <em>fuck</em> out of it,  and they're probably getting some small projects together to bundle it with,  too.
<p></p>The thing about valve is that steam makes them effectively independantly wealthy. They're their own publisher,  too. It means that they can do whatever they want for however long they want. They've cornered the PC industry,  so even if their games started to blow they wouldn't have to worry. but they won't because Valve is made up of <em>only</em> the most dedicated and talented individuals. the studio is one giant passion project. So if they're taking a while to release something it isn't a marketing stunt; they want it to be GOOD.

            @Lurker The whole concept behind making the game episodic was that so they could bring out the games at a cheaper price and complete them quicker than they could a full game -_-

            Actually,  you know what my quibble with the Secret of NIMH was? Nicodemus. As a concept. And also the pendant/necklace/whatever. I can understand the rats doing some pretty outlandish things because they have (stolen) electricity and technology and whatnot. But there here comes this dude that does some pretty outlandish things with <em>magic</em>! And since he's the only one,  he feels very,  very out of place.
