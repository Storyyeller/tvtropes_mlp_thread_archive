            "So,  recently Past Sins was finally finished.
<p></p>Seeing as it has somehow become so critally acclaimed that some over-eager have called it better than canon and demmanded a movie made out of it,  I have to ask: am I the only one who thinks it's a overly-predictable,  idoit ball filled disaster? "
<p></p>Didn't think it was <em>that</em> bad. There were a lot of cute moments and a few scenes were pretty fun (Rarity teaching Nyx how to drink tea for instance),  but once the plot kicked in,  it sorta went downhill <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YMMV" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YMMV">in zerky's opinion</a>. The plot was,  like you said,  pretty predictable (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Especially the end,  where Luna took away most of Nyx's abilities/memory/age and then turned her back into kidNyx. The *exact* same ending was used in Creeping Darkness,  another fic by the same author.</span>) and there were a few <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">plot holes</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">idiot balls</a> that could have been handled better. There were also a ton of typos and some of the grammar was a little off,  which normally zerky wouldn't comment upon,  but there were apparently at least 6 people reading it over and checking for that sort of thing,  which makes it a little more egregious.
<p></p>It was <em>still</em> definitely better than 90% of the stuff out there,  although at least in zerky's mind,  it would have been best off as a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> sort of dealio with just enough plot to keep the story moving.

It is,  in fact,  very possible. You can't please <em>everyone</em>,  after all. Trying to assert otherwise would be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanMyopia" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanMyopia">Fan Myopia</a>.

<p></p>Either give those 3 idiots their cutie marks and make them background side-orders (That's all they'll end up being once they get them anyway,  as I'm sure (AND WE SHOULD ALL BE AWARE OF BY NOW) that they're just Executive Mandates the creators had to put in the show for greedy-ass sounding reasons),  or risk having them become the "D.W.-class"(Scrappys)characters in a series that doesn't need nor call for it!
<p></p>Other than that,  here's to Season 2 hopefully not sucking without its true creator...

            I think they kept them in the show because they were named off of canon characters from the previous generations of figurines.  And Lauren,  I suppose,  is too much of a filly to resist.  But the only episode they starred in that I enjoyed was "The Cutie Mark Chronicles",  and that's because they only appeared in the framing devices around the mane sixes' back stories.

            ^To each their own,  of course,  but I don't think they're that bad.  Obliviousness aside,  they're pretty cute,  and they make an interesting contrast to the main six.

That's what made them tolerable. They were just framing devices. But also,  they were in a position wher they actually learned some shit instead of acting like dumbasses and nearly dragging the show down arounds them,  not just the episodes they were in where they did do that,  in the episodes they starred in. Neither of which were that good,  sadly. I almost thought these three were going to be this show's downfall - and worse still,  they STILL could be if not given a direction to go in,  other than an obsessive one over something that takes age and skills to obtain in their world!
<p></p>Not to mention,  they have yet to prove themselves in a positive light as characters worth giving a damn about,  which is even worse.
<p></p>Without the right writers or motivations for them,  they'll end up too pathetic to root for,  or worse,  SCRAPPYS. Scrappys on a show that does not need to be weighed down by such BS.
<p></p>I know they're kids,  but come on. Give me a goddamn show where the kid(s) is actually smart enough to not act this stupid for something he/she needs to earn through actual aging,  practice,  skill acquirement,  and above all else,  experience,  PLEASE!
<p></p>Thank you.

            If we're taking a 'come on guys,  these characters are obviously Executive Meddling personified' stance on it,  you should probably just go ahead and apply that to the whole show. Whatever the creative team*
Lauren Faust didn't do the whole thing herself,  you know!
feels about the show as a whole,  it's a commercial enterprise designed to sell toys from a strictly corporate view,  so there's no reason singling out one subset of characters or another if you're taking that stance.
<p></p>^I'm not agreeing with you,  to be honest.  I like the CMC for their own sakes,  and I hope they get a few more episodes of character development that actually sticks.

However,  I wasn't taking any kind of stance on Executive meddling. At all. As for the CMC,  with some improved focus on them,  I'm sure the CMC could be likable characters worth rooting for.
<p></p>But I'll agree with you on that - The CMC need development that sticks. Development that will actually make me like them more than I do now...

            I don't mind the CMC that much either.  To be honest,  the Cutie Mark Chronicles isn't really one of my favorite episodes.  Other than Twilight's and Pinkie Pie's,  I didn't find the flashbacks all that interesting because they were a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a>.  Those two were the only ones where we really got information about the characters that we didn't already know.
<p></p>I can see how some people might be annoyed by the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs">CM Cs</a>,  but they really don't grate on me too much.  And yes,  they need some genuine development.  You can only ride out the "attempts to gain Cutie Marks" plot so many times before you need to mix it up a little.  An interesting idea that I heard once was to give one of the CMC's their cutie mark and see how it affects their friendship.  Would be a step up from "random CMC shenanigans".

            I actually like all the CMC episodes so far,  but I agree that their shtick will get old quick if they don't start learning anything.  They seem to work best when not pursuing their cutie marks,  my favorite moments from them are when they are just being themselves,  not trying something ridiculous.
