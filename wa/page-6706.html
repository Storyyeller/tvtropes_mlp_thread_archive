            Hmm,  if murder is that horrifying and rare,  maybe a lesser crime would be more appropriate. But it would still have to be something serious,  so I don't think eating a cake would suffice.

            I felt Cadance and SA worked fine,  yes they could use more fleshing out,  but we saw nothing to indicate they DIDN'T have more to them,  just that we didn't have time to see it. But people need to stop picking it apart becuase it doesn't fit into cliche X,  or expected narrative act Y. Screw every other work,  any normal expectations,  all I care about is if the show remain consistent with itself,  not "the great big list of how shows should be made" as long as it makes sense within the established cannon and logic of the show,  I'm fine with it.
<p></p>And sure,  would be nice to have each and every pony get the same exact amount of screen time at all times,  but it's not going to happen,  all of them were there,  yes the plot focused more on Twi,  Cadance and SA. But it didn't ignore the rest,  there was no reason they needed to do more other then becuase said "great big list" said they needed more screentime,  nothing in the actual episode was hampered by them not being in it more.

            @Ginger: Yes,  I have no problem with that,  the real issue was that we've never really been able to see the limits of Celestia's abilities before,  so it comes off as a bit... anticlimactic.

There's a flashback scene there where she tried to fry Discord with the sun,  but he shifted the planet so that the beam would hit Luna instead. Celestia was able to get Luna out of the way in time,  but then she was hit instead.

            As far as the Season 2 Finale goes the only problem I had is that the solution was very anticlimactic beside that it was a fun wild ride.
<p></p>Yeah they made two new character,  a protagonists and with a great relationship with Twilight,  so what?
<p></p>To me it was entertaining from the beginning to the end,  and that what only matter,  how fun the watch was.
<p></p>Of course,  In my opinion.

            ohhh she was holding back becuase she couldn't unleash her full power without innocent casualties caught in the crossfire...I like it. Goes with my theory that Tia has the more raw power,  but Luna has better fine control over her power.

            <div class="quoteblock">Glaring flaws. Like what?</div>
<p></p>Okay,  first the whole <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">Remember the New Guy</a>. That one was obvious,  and ripples through pretty much the entire episode,  ruining much of the good stuff. And really,  it made no sense whatsoever. Not being able to tell your sister in person is one thing,  but surely he could spare a few minutes to dictate a letter?
<p></p>Then there were the actual main characters being completely sidelined,  and acting rather OOC. As mentioned before,  Applejack wouldn't suffer anyone dissing her treats without comment,  for example. The fact that no one seems to listen to Twilight despite Candence's behaviour is just weird. They have been best friends with Twilight for a long time now,  and no amount of 'wedding nerves' could justify the extend of the bride's rudeness.
<p></p>The resolution felt lacking in impact. Partially because it revolved around those two new people,  partially because it was too sudden. You can't have something cheesy like that with characters that we don't know. (I am suddenly entertaining the idea that I'd rather have SA punch the Queen in the face,  or something. Less supernatural cheese,  more mundane awesome)
<p></p>It did a whole lot of good,  but its ambitions reached further than 44 minutes would allow. The show runners should have kept that in mind when they wrote this,  and I consider that a fault.

            Supes did have an episode where someone complained that he was holding humanity backwith his sheer awesomeness.
<p></p>Anyways,  I like to think their Alicorn Lasers aren't as powerful as their Talent-related magic,  but the Talent skills all have too much splash damage to be usable inside their own castle.
<p></p>@Kayeka: Some of that could be chalked up to Fae-Changeling Glamour glossing over the flaws and preventing most of the ponies from noticing what's wrong.

<p></p>As for Applejack:

<p></p>B: She's been learning that that's a bad attitude to have for a while now.
