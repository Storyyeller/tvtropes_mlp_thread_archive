<p></p>Well,  I was born premature 3 months before I should have at one pound twelve ounces. Thankfully I was intact,  except for my eyes which were missing the Maculas. I also had to be given steroids and be put on a lot of machinery for 6 months before I could function on my own,  but that's another matter. Also my family had some sort of eye disease that slowly deteriorates the lenses over time,  but I never did much research on that. Basically the combination of all that just screwed up my eyes. Surprisingly,  my left eye was able to function after being stabbed by a five year old who was on a sugar rush and didn't listen to me when he wanted to play Jedai with me. But anyway,  when my retinas detached for the fourth time,  they weren't able to save my left eye and I lost my sight in that one. And two years later I got the Cataracts. My parents didn't have the insurance to pay for the surgery to remove them,  so they told me a lie at the time that I'd have 5 years to have the same level of vision before things went south. I was 14 at the time,  but I insisted I knew enough to make my own choices and wanted it done. Needless to say it didn't happen and I only found the truth when I hit my head hard on an iron pole because I couldn't quite see it. Still they never treated no matter how much I begged my parents to and now  today my doctor informs me I'll lose the rest in 4 months time.

            Thanks everyone. Sorry,  wasn't trying to come off as mopy. I've just had one really,  really messed up life including child abuse,  drug addicted parents,  and a host of other things I'm trying to get over. If anything,  it's preventing me from creativity for some reason. I've always wanted to be a writer but these last few years I've had a major mental block. But that's probably enough about me,  I don't want to get anyone down here.
