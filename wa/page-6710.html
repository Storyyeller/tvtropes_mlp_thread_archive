            If there was a spell that could stop a Changeling's magic,  don't you think Celestia would have used it. Thus severing the Queen from her battery and being able to defeat her.
<p></p>And if even Twilight can't use the spell,  then who can? With Celestia was taken out then the only one left would be Luna and she can't run around Equestria constantly casting it on everyone. Even if both of them were active they couldn't.

            @Mio I think he means that the story didn't feel the need to explain EVERYTHING,  but the scenario also didn't negate the possibility that a reasonable explanation exists.

<p></p>Hmmm,  Pinkie was able to spot the lesser Changelings disguising as her friends and herself,  yet she didn't realise Chrysalis was pretending to be Cadence. Makes sense,  she knows her close friends better and prolly chose to give "Cadence" the benefit of the doubt.
<p></p>On top of that,  the lesser Changeling simply could not capture the perfect image of Pinkie <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16"> you cannot comprehend the true nature of the Pink! ...ie Pie.

            I... honestly don't think the princesses knew much about the Changelings,  if anything. Twi's dispel spell worked,  but I don't think she knew that until she tried to use it.

            @ Mio,  the simple fact that it doesn't serve up all the answers,  it doesn't contrive itself to make sure the audience knows stuff just so the audience knows it instead of becuase the Mane 6 need to know it. We see what the Mane 6 sees,  and the world is vibrant and living enough that we know more is going on that we never see,  but it never fels the need to indulge that. Yes it's not that big a deal for most shows,  but for the genre it's in that's big. Most other shows of it's type,  if it isn't on screen,  it doesn't happen,  they don't trust there audience to fill in the gaps from there imagination instead they spoon feed it to them.
<p></p>Basicly that fact that they DON'T assume <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">Viewers Are Morons</a> and have to be spoon fed every little detail/
<p></p>also,  what Ginger said

            @Seraphem: Hmm,  I guess.
<p></p>I admit it is very easy to assume that if it was not explicitly stated that it didn't happen.,  and I typically assume a Doylist stance on these issues instead of looking for an in-universe reason so I'm more likely to call out the writer even when I shouldn't.
