<p></p>Ah. Well,  I don't really consider our foods <em>bizarre</em> (then again,  I guess I'm biased),  though there are less mainstream foods here which are strange which I don't eat. Most infamously Mopani worms.
<p></p>I guess the most unusual by outsider standards is basically our biggest delecacy. Biltong(Now my mouth is watering.) Which is dried,  cured,  salted,  raw meat. Which might sound odd for a delicacy,  but it <em>is</em> expensive and <em>is</em> delicious.

            Yup,  because student-teacher romance was never enough for the shippers,  we now need adopted insest.
<p></p>But anyway,  I'm glad they're bringing back the seaponies. Maybe they'll bring back the breezies,  but that's a bit much to hope for.

            That would be... interesting. Perhaps they have an equivalent? I'm hypothesizing that all hooved and equine-related creatures have some sort of Mark denoting some special aptitude or  semimagical talent. I also think that the unique qualities of the Mark can somewhat transcend the pony's nature and are magical in their own way. So Pinkie can do what she does because she's so strong in her abilities that her magical talent is very strong indeed. I'm sure if she was a pegasus or unicorn,  she'd still be just Pinkie as ever.

            maybe donkeys have their cutie marks in some inconspicuous place,  like on the bottom of the back left hoof.

            @Sereg: Any obscure food that crosses cultural lines tends to become bizarre.  Although the thing you mentioned just sounds kinda like beef jerky.
<p></p>Like one of the things my grandma makes is basically rolled up dough filled with butter and sour cream. It looks like a giant slug,  but it tastes really good.
<p></p>As for the cutie marks,  I'm pretty sure that so far the only species we've seen with them are ponies.  Donkeys,  griffons,  buffalo,  etc don't seem to have them. Zecora is the only exception,  and even that isn't a traditional CM.

<p></p>Fruit Bats,

<p></p>Yeah,  I've heard that biltong is similar to jerky,  but we've got loads of varieties from different meats and methods of preperation. Ostrich would probably be the most eyebrow-raising meat we use (it's delicious).
<p></p>That doughy thing sounds like it could be nice.
<p></p>We have some doughy things as well. On the sweet side,  koeksusters (which means cake sisters) which can be made with a doughnut like dough,  or with a much harder pastry. They're sticky. Covered in syrup in the latter case and icing sugar in the former.
<p></p>On the savoury dough side,  there's this dough that's deep fried in oil we call vetkoek (which means fat cake). Typically cut open and stuffed with a filling,  most commonly mince,  but syrup,  jam and various other fillings are ommon.
<p></p>Simplest thing to copy we have is bunny chow which is basically a hollowed out section of a loaf of bread stuffed with curry.
<p></p>Our unusual grains are samp and sorghum (though I've only eaten sorghum in cookies).
<p></p>Speaking of which,  what grains would they have in Equestria? They seem to have maize (we call maize mielies is SA) and I <em>think</em> I've seen wheat,  but according to the German comics,  they don't have barley (though a neighbouring country does).
<p></p>EDIT: Yes! I also want camels and llamas and alpacas  an more zebras and more horses and giraffes and deer...

            There's also Timber wolves and Cerberus(Though he's more a 'the' than an 'a' so he might not count).  Depending on how canonical the comics are there's also trolls,  giant spiders,  pony-eating flowers(Again,  for arguable definition of creature).
<p></p>And of course we have griffons and changelings as a species. Draconaquises <em>maybe</em>,  but I'm in the camp that Discord is the only one of them.

            Pinkie's cake recipe in Applebuck Season calls for Wheat Germ,  so they definitely have wheat.  I'm pretty sure they have oats as well.  There were probably a few others mentioned,  but I can't think of any off the top of my head.

            Ah yes,  they have wheat germ and oatmeal,  so that's wheat and oats.
<p></p>I am in the "draconequii are another species's equivalent for alicorns" camp.
<p></p>EDIT: Huh! I've just realised! No barley means no beer! And seeing as thouh historically hard cider and beer competed with each other,  that would explain why cider is so important in Equestria!
