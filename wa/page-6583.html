            The one time I remember watching/playing something and then loosing slee over it was the Chzo Mythos. Five Days a Stranger isn't actually that bad,  but then I saw Trilby's Notes. After that I was too scarred to get a good nights rest.

            I am really interested in Cabin in the Woods,  but I have never handled horror well. Stuff sticks in my head and it can stick hard.
<p></p>Oddly though,  I'm good at imagining my own horrific scenarios without getting too freaked out. I guess it's because I'm in control of it at all times.

            I've also been curious about The Cabin in the Woods.  It helps that nearly all the reviews have been positive.
<p></p>I've always been a bit interested in the morbid and horrific,  even as a child.  I remember Bluebeard and The Masque of the Red Death were two of my favorite stories.

            I'm not a huge fan of horror,  actually I stay far away from th stuff. So imagine my confusion when the most highly regarded Doctor Who episodes just happen to be the horror ones.
<p></p>And it's also probably why I have t finished Majora's Mask yet,  besides,  you know,  the snow mountain dungeon being impossible and confusing. It's a wonder I even made it through the shadow
Temple of Ocarina of Time,  for all intents and purposes I should've had a heart attack mid game.

            There were definitely some things about Majora's mask that I found creepy - the happy mask salesman,  the mood,  etc. - but on the whole I didn't find it too bad. The worst parts were the mask transformations,  and that was because of the <em>noise</em>.
<p></p>Interestingly,  I thing I take that as a sort of general rule of 'scaryness'. I can watch anything,  and it will barely phase me. Give me blood,  guts,  violence,  sure. Doesn't bug me. As long as it's silent. It's the <em>noises</em> they make that get to me. The screaming,  the pain,  the misery,  it just... eugh.
<p></p>Like case in point,  near the end of cabin in the woods,  you see some shots of people getting killed in <em>insanely</em> violent and horrific ways,  but you see them on computer screens and without noise,  so they honestly didn't bug me. Those same faceless people dying in equally horrible ways on screen with noises freaked me the hell out.

            Scary movies,  hm? Let's see... The most recent one I can think of would be Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark and The Descent. I'm also a huge fan of John Carpenter's the Thing. Now that I think about it,  I really like films involving Pseudo-Lovecraftian Horrors. Not a big surprise,  all things considered.

            I've seen the descent,  I'm not sure I'd call it lovecraftian at all.
<p></p>I only watched that movie because I was staying at a friends cabin with him and his asshole dad. They both liked horror movies. The friend was fairly accepting of others dislike of the genre. His dad? Not so much.

            I haven't seen the remake of Don't Be Afraid of the Dark,  but I should at some point.  I also loved Carpenter's The Thing.  I'd say my favorite though might be The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari.  Even in terms of a film without much violence,  the atmosphere that's created is incredibly chilling.  Pan,  have you seen Videodrome?

            Not so much Lovecraftian as it is the sense of the unknown,  inhuman terror. Though Lovecraft's definately a favorite.

            Heh,  the scariest movie moment for me was from Inception,  in that one scene when Mal turns and looks at the camera. I knew it was gonna happen and it still jolted me like crazy.
