            And it's not like we don't see enough of Sombra to know he's a threat,  just from the traps and other stuff he left behind to gaurd the Heart,  you can tell he is the most intelligent and competent villain so far. Yes he didn't get much characterization on screen,  but just through seeing what he's done you know he's a force to be reckoned with. Yes I would have loved to see more of him in the present and had him make a bigger impact beyond ominous force of evil,  but there wasn't time for that. Plus it's possible he's not actually gone.

            I do have to agree that Sombra could easily not be gone. His horn was clearly intact in the end,  and he demonstrated the ability to corrupt things that a broken piece of himself comes in contact with as well as regenerate said broken piece.

            I can kinda see how it might have been rushed a bit.  It wasn't so much the plot set up,  so much as it spent a bit more time expositing about the Crystal Empire than it did actually showing how it works.  It felt at some points like there wasn't much at stake,  since we never really get to interact with the Crystal Ponies in any meaningful way.  Out of all of them,  only the librarian felt like a real character.  The others were all sort of interchangeable.

            Sombra really has been the most competent villain so far - he didn't lose because he got cocky and just stood there/wouldn't shut up. Those traps he devised were pretty devilishly clever.

Well,  apart from the fact that he hid the powerful artefact that could defeat him <em>in his own throne room</em>,  on the basis that nopony would have been brave enough to search there.
<p></p>And not only that: even if he for some reason had no better place available what reason could he possibly have had to put that gem <em>on display</em>,  at the centre of a big room in a tower with <em>open windows</em>? I mean,  the trap idea was great,  I've got nothing to say about it,  but couldn't he have used a fake gem for the trap and hid the right one,  I dunno,  inside a spare chamber pot?

            So,  upon rewatching the episodes,  I've noticed that there is a <em>lot</em> more potential foreshadowing going on than just Celestia's plans for Twilight.
<p></p><ul><li>When Twilight triggers the Nightmare Door trap,  notice that during the entire bit where she tries to chase down the door,  her magic aura gets progressively darker as she gets angrier until she lashes out with black magic,  which backfires. That could easily become a problem for her later on down the line.
<p></p></li><li>When Cadance activates the Crystal Heart,  she is identified as "The Crystal Princess" by a pony and <em>her cutie mark glows</em>. There's definitely something important about that,  and since the episode doesn't touch on it again,  it'll probably be important for the next time the Crystal Empire becomes important.
<p></p></li><li>As I stated above,  the focus on Sombra's regenerative abilities and the fact that his horn was intact in the end.
</li></ul><p></p>While some of these might just be neat details,  they're certainly ripe for expansion and elaboration later in the season.

            @Carc: Honestly,  it was a good plan because 1. noone knew where it was anyway,  and 2. even if they did they wouldn't want to go in there to attempt to get it.  Keep in mind he probably devised all the traps on the basis that <em>he would be living in the castle</em>,  and therefore around to own anyone who tried to steal it.  And keep in mind that not even the most powerful unicorn in Equestria could bust his magical ward on the heart anyway.

            Fair enough. Still,  I think that it was in blatant violation of the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlordList" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlordList">Evil Overlord List</a> <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>But in any case,  I can certainly agree that Sombra was a far more careful villain that Nightmare Moon or Discord.

            Also,  I find it interesting that Celestia and Luna decided to just brute force Sombra out rather than using the elements or the heart or something.  I wonder what the significance of that is.
