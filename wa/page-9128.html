            And if Lauren had stayed and presided over a crappy third season,  then what?
<p></p>Remember also that she also helped check scripts for season 2.

            You just can't make an "examples of how this show is going downhill without her involvement" list and then include something that's completely hers.
<p></p>Personally,  I think season 2 was better. Better humor and better animation,  and it had a bit less of the "our target audience is elementary schoolers" feel.

            Yeah,  on the whole I found more episodes of season 2 enjoyable than season 1. Yes,  I disagree with the humanized bits as well,  but they were few and far between.
<p></p>Season 2 had it's duds,  but so did season 1,  comparatively. It's just that now that we're growing used to this show's baseline level of quality it's easier to pick out which episodes are bad in comparison.

            Season 1 had stuff that I liked,  stuff I disliked,  and stuff I was meh about.
<p></p>Season 2? Same deal. That's just how it is with TV shows. It comes down to what works for you and what doesn't.

            I mean yeah,  Lauren had some bad ideas and made mistakes (wanting the show to be more of an action-adventure series for example,  which thankfully got overruled)... but its increasingly clear that most of the first season's amazing quality was due to her.
<p></p>When Lauren was there,  we got Sondheim musicals and eighties rock.  When Lauren left,  we got typical kids shows songs.
<p></p>When Lauren was there,  we got ponies pulling a train and a consistent low-tech universe which seemed like it was credibly built by Ponies.  When she left we got "Ponies drive tractors!" and the most blatant toy plug in modern animation: the Friendship Express.
<p></p>When Lauren was there,  we had plotlines and characters that could actually be taken (relatively) seriously by an adult audience.  When she left,  we got "Rarity gets into a fight with her sister!  Pinkie Pie annoys a donkey!  Rainbow Dash learns reading is cool!"  (though that last one was kinda cute I'll admit)
<p></p>It's kind of reminding me of Dragon Ball GT.

            I liked the second season more,  but that's mostly because I got the feeling that they were more sticking to their kids/girls demographic for the first half or so of season 1. Somewhere during the middle of season 1,  they kinda <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">grew the beard</a>.

            @ Moe: I'm not a musical fan so I can't really contest that point except by saying I liked all of the series two songs.
<p></p>Twahlaght Spahkle's Bahlloon wasn't as blatant as the Friendship Express?
<p></p>And when we had Lauren we had such gems of lessons as,  don't jump to conclusions,  don't hang out with people who are jerks and the plot of everyone goes to the Wild West to be superfluous.

            <div class="quoteblock">I mean yeah,  Lauren had some bad ideas and made mistakes (wanting the show to be more of an action-adventure series for example,  which thankfully got overruled)...</div>
<p></p>Personally,  I'd have <em>liked</em> that.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> but its increasingly clear that most of the first season's amazing quality was due to her.
When Lauren was there,  we got Sondheim musicals and eighties rock. When Lauren left,  we got typical kids shows songs.</div>
<p></p>I've liked Season 2's songs. Especially This Day Aria,  Becoming Popular and Smile.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> When Lauren was there,  we got ponies pulling a train and a consistent low-tech universe which seemed like it was credibly built by Ponies. When she left we got "Ponies drive tractors!" and the most blatant toy plug in modern animation: the Friendship Express.</div>
<p></p>No. Pulling the train was more stupid than just driving it. And <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a> is a real life phenomenon.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> When Lauren was there,  we had plotlines and characters that could actually be taken (relatively) seriously by an adult audience. When she left,  we got "Rarity gets into a fight with her sister! Pinkie Pie annoys a donkey! Rainbow Dash learns reading is cool!" (though that last one was kinda cute I'll admit) </div>
<p></p>Um,  I consider the plotlines of season 2 better overall. Admittedly Sisterhooves Social isn't my kind of episode,  but it's still well regarded.
<p></p>But of course,  you and I have very different opinions on this stuff.
