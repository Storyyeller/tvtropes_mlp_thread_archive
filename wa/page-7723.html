<div class="quoteblock">so I don't even know what you're complaining about here.</div>
<p></p>RECAP TIME:
<p></p>I said "Ponies don't poop."  Chadaman said they do because we've seen them do it.  I say "the show's canon isn't even internally consistent so my headcanon can't be jossed."  People ask me to provide examples of in-show inconsistencies.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Cutie Marks haven't changed in concept at all since their introduction</div>
<p></p>So do you get a cutie mark when you <em>apply</em> your special talent,  when you <em>realize</em> something is your talent,  or does it have to be brought on by something external?  The same episode implies all three things.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">issue is to many poeple are so used to shows that sit you down and spoonfeed you every single peice of info compleltly and un missably becuase they Assume Viewers Are Morons</div>
<p></p>Oh,  that's nice.  Call me an idiot because I question inconsistencies.  How considerate of you.
<p></p>For what its worth,  I don't even watch TV that much.  Most of my entertainment is anime,  books and video gamesâ€”mediums where you often have to figure things out for yourself.  So you can take your "you're a victim of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">Viewers Are Morons</a>" rhetoric and eat it.

            The only "contradicion" that I can think of is the age of Ponyville,  which is easily explained by Twilight reffering to earth pony towns in general rather than just Ponyville. (There are other explanations too,  but that's the simplest one.)
<p></p>EDIT: You get your cutie mark when you acknowledge that you have performed your special talent. Nothing has contradicted that.

            Re: Greed growth: My best understanding is that dragons age normally (at whatever rate they tend to),  but if they're allowed to hoard and have that impulse repeatedly fed into,  they will undergo greed growth to take advantage of the (presumable) glut of resources.  So the oldest and most powerful dragons aren't always the biggest,  but they're the wisest (or the most canny,  at least) and the ones with the greatest self-control.

            @Red Agreed. I believe that dragons can age at different speeds and different ways depending on circumstances,  so Spike <em>can</em> become that knight from his fantasy if he's careful.
<p></p>EDIT: It's <em>not</em> a contradiction if it's explainable by extra unknown information. All your :contradictions" <em>are</em> explainable.

            @Red: That's how I see it.  Dragons <em>can</em> grow up into mindless beasts if they give into the hoarding impulse,  but they don't necessarily have to.  There's also the fact that Spike is pretty obviously a different species of dragon,  so who knows what biological differences there are?
<p></p>Anyway,  Moe can have whatever headcanon he wants.  If it contradicts what we see in the show,  that's fine as long he doesn't expect everyone else to go along with it,  or complains that show doesn't agree with the headcanon.
<p></p>Also,  I'm <em>really</em> glad I missed the pooping discussion.  Ick.

            I think we're getting a bit too specific with the Cutie Marks; the show never confirms that it's specifically any of those things.  All it says is that a pony's CM is related to their special talent,  and outside of that the epiphany that results in the mark appearing might be different for different ponies.  Given that the marks themselves are pretty heavily up to interpretation,  I don't see why the events wouldn't also reflect that.
<p></p>TL;DR the show is vague on these things for just that reason; it never explicitly addresses the mechanics behind the cutie marks so that it won't look inconsistent if they utilize them differently from episode to episode.

            we never said you were bashing the show,  but that the "contradictions" your point out,  aren't
<p></p>You get your cutie mark when you,  at the very deepest level of your being,  recognize what it is that makes you special and that you love doing. HOW you do that varies from pony to pony. yes the circumstances that caused that epiphany are different for each pony,  as are the reactions to it,  but that is what happened in every one of those tales of how a pony got a cutie mark.
<p></p>and the only "outside influence" part I can think your thinking of was Twi's and the Rainboom dind't give her a cutie mark,  it made her nagic go nuts,  and that combined with being accepted as Celestia's personal student cuased her cutie mark.

            Hey,  marston.  Please don't let us scare you away - this is rather an odd discussion we're having.
<p></p>As for cutie marks,  I would guess that what causes them to appear is as unique and specific as the marks themselves (hush,  Sereg!).  The cutie marks symbolize an epiphany; you can't lay down a solid set of rules for when a pony realizes what they want their life's work to be.
