            Twilight Sparkle was the main character in season one and conceived as being the focus of the show. As of now,  she's still important with the whole magic thing and the hints we've been given of what we're building towards,  but there's much less of a focus. But this is just the process of a show growing and developing as the people involved with it find what it's really about.

            @shipping Zecora and Spike: That made me think,  if Zecora wrote Spike a love letter,  and it was in rhyme,  coming from her,  would that be a poem or her normal prose? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>@the episode in general: I liked it,  and thought it was pretty funny,  especially when the CMC got involved and the part with Winona being blow-dried.  I also noticed,  unless I'm wrong,  if they did have Winona chasing Angel like I thought they did,  then that's pretty accurate for a dog.  All of my dogs like to at least try to chase rabbits,  and I'm pretty sure that rabbits are actually an instinctual prey animal for dogs.  And I also liked that they cleared up what happened with Peewee,  rather than making people wonder where he was.  I also realized,  after someone here mentioned it,  that Spike being given gifts makes him greedy for even more (especially if it's something like gems) is a consistent trait of his from "Secret of My Excess" although luckily he didn't start stealing random objects again (having to give up his gems probably prevented that,  and Zecora knew it,  which is why she took one and gave it to charity instead of just using it in a potion for herself or something).
<p></p>Interestingly enough,  considering the way Spike was being pulled in different ways by trying to walk all the animals on leashes,  soon after I watched the episode,  my mom and I took the two Pomeranians for a short walk (Luna and Lily).  Like in the episode,  they ended up both wanting to go different ways,  and we ended up going home sooner than intended because Lily got scared of something (she's the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a> of my dogs) and wanted to run home while Luna also got stubborn but she wanted to keep going because she likes going on adventures (and she also wanted to eat something out of the grass that we took out of her mouth).  So even with two people and two dogs (who are both small enough to carry),  pets can certainly be a handful even if one is experienced in taking care of them.  Just an interesting coincidence,  considering what happened in the episode.
<p></p>I also watched Sisterhooves Social with my mom,  and she said that she thought that the artwork in the show was very well-done,  which is a big compliment because she's a graphic designer/artist and knows what good art looks like.  She also seemed to like it in general and also praised the voice acting.

            @Lopiny: They do,  although it's also a coincidence because I named Luna after the cat from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorMoon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a> and I think I chose the name Lily before I knew about the toyline Lily Blossom pony (or Lily Valley from the show itself) and probably chose it because of the connection to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a>.  But because of my dog Lily,  I imagine that Lily Blossom (from the toyline) would have a personality like my dog Lily.  Lily also reminds me of Fluttershy sometimes,  because she's not only the shy,  sweet one,  but she's also kind of tall and graceful for a Pomeranian,  kind of like Fluttershy as a filly.  In fact,  I almost called her "Fluttershy" yesterday by accident! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16"> And one of my nicknames for her is "Flutterpom."

            Speaking of dogs,  I was glad to see that Winona got a little bit of characterization. Also,  Applejack scratching her stomach reminds me of a scene in Toy Story 3 when Buster,  the dachshund,  goes up to Andy and gets him to scratch him to serve as a distraction. Not sure why it reminds me of that,  of all things.

            I wonder what would have happened if Spike had asked Winona to help herd or round up the other animals. Although that could have caused even more problems if the other animals just ended up fighting with her.

            Well Winona wasn't being particularly cooperative,  Spike doesn't know how to herd,  and some of the animals were flying.

            Just finished it. Not a bad episode,  but definitely not one of my favorites. Nice to see that they brought dragon greed back into the spotlight,  plus Sweetie Belle squealing over the Crystal Empire was adorable ^^
<p></p>Also,  I can sympathize with Spike here. Taking care of a number of animals at once isn't as easy as it sounds. Trust me,  I have a Great Dane/Something else mix in my den right now barking at a cat that she's been watching for like ten minutes straight.
