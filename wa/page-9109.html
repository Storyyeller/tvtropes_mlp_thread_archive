            Well,  the antagonists are strong-willed and competent,  particularly Juror #4,  and they're won over by argument in the end.

            It's... I don't know quite how to describe <em>exaclty</em> what I dislike about 9. Because to a certain degree I <em>do</em> like it... I just don't like it <em>enough</em>,  I guess.
<p></p>9 was what I always wanted in a movie as a teenager - a very dark,  very adult animated film. I wanted it to be as good as it could,  and while it does things <em>right</em>,  it ultimately wasn't enough.
<p></p>The story in it ultimately ends up being very pointless. All that's really accomplished is dwindling the numbers of the 9,  despite the movie's implication that life returns to the planet,  which a moments thought will tell you would not work,  since all that ever happens is it <em>rains</em>. Woo. The earth has still been burnt and salted,  and most,  if not all,  like is dead. There's no real room for regrowth there. At the beginning of the movie the 9 have a single enemy that they're easily avoiding,  but thanks to the rock-stupid protagonist over half of them die before they can return to essentially the same place - especially when you consider that the one enemy they had at the beginning would have been killed by 7 soon enough <em>anyways</em>,  well before it would have done any major damage to anyone. Hell,  even 2 might have made it out alive if it weren't for 9.
<p></p>So in the end we get a circular plot in which nothing is resolved except for murdercating half the last living things on the planet,  and the vague and silly promise of hope that a moments thought denies. The art and animation is gorgeous,  the concept is fantastic,  and the original short was beautiful. I wanted so badly to like 9,  but I just couldn't. It had so much potential and it just fell on it's face. I was in fact SO dissapointed by 9 that I consider it the main reason I have any taste in movies.

<p></p>Yeah,  Fielder is in it. He plays Juror #2 and the part fits him like a glove. That movie is really amazingly well-cast. And yeah,  Juror #3 was the angry father.

I think he's fascinated since he's starting to discover that Bronies are kind of a big deal.  I don't think he's actually interested in watching it though,  but I have been thinking about letting him know I'm a fan.</span>
