            More ponies. Family Appreciation Day.
<p></p>Granny Smith is a fun character.
<p></p>that's a sorry looking broom...
<p></p>Oh,  <em>zap</em> apples...ok,  sure.
<p></p>Filthy Rich? Not quite as bad as Fancy Pants...but still pretty bad. and Damnit diamond tiara! No wonder you're such a daughter of a dog!!
<p></p>Damnit Tiara!
<p></p>ok,  so wait. The zap apples come about via weather phenomena that <em>aren't</em> controlled by the pegasi?
<p></p>the glass cracked when she put her hoof down but now when she threw it against the wall?
<p></p>wait,  so zap apple trees are separate from normal trees? So they're just completely barren until a freak storm rolls around?
<p></p>if ponies don't eat meat,  than why does the farm have pigs?
<p></p>ok,  granny smith could give pinkie a run for her money.
<p></p>Prismatic laser apples!
<p></p>Timber wolves? Wolves made of wood? I really do like what this show does with animal names. Not so much pony names.
<p></p>Good episode,  especially Granny's flashback. Even if it did raise a few more questions than it answered.

            Actually,  I wonder that too.
<p></p>Or more specifically:  would the Elements ever be able to work on someone who embodies the virtues they're named after?  Like what if Discord suddenly became a really nice guy,  would they work on him?

            I cannot fathom what would cause Celestia to snap other than actually killing her subjects.

            I like to think that the Elements have somewhat of a will of their own,  choosing their bearers. If the bearer willfully betrays their Element,  then they either A: stop functioning for the bearer until they are redeemed,  Paladin style,  or B: abandon the bearer altogether and return to their dormant state,  depending on the severity of their betrayal. You could <em>try</em> to use the Elements against the likes of Luna/Celestia,  but more likely than not,  the Elements would veto your abuse of power unless the situation justified the action.
<p></p>Of course,  that's all headcanon,  so yeah.

            Well when used on Luna,  they only purified her,  so presumably they wouldn't affect her if she wasn't evil at the moment.
<p></p>Seeing individual uses for the elements would be neat,  but I'm not really sure what they would do.  They represent friendship and all that,  so it makes sense they need to be together to do anything,  but Celestia was able to use some or all of them by herself,  so who knows.

            @Ginger: Eh,  I don't know. given how insanely powerful they appear to be,  it's kinda hard to someone inventing that. They're powerful enough to defeat an anthropomorphic personification of their polar opposite,  which is probably a much greater degree of power than <em>any</em> creature could ever exert... so where you you even being trying to make that?
<p></p>Still,  headcanon is headcanon. My husks of an ancient god is no more valid than your ancient technology.

            Hmm..... I'm thinking about reading the fanfic known as "Romance reports". I know that it's a clopfic and all,  but I have a rather strong tolerance towards that kind of stuff {It doesn't bother me as much as it should},  and I've heard that this fic actually has a story to it too. Has anyone here read that fic,  liked it and might be able to reccomend it to me? Anyone at all?
