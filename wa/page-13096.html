I've read that media and ads aimed at children tend to have the audience-surrogate character(s) a year older than the target audience—close enough that the audience can identify with them,  but slightly older so the audience can look up to them a bit,  too (and because the audience would prefer to identify with a slightly idealized version of their selves).

Anyone think which ponies would fit in that's roles? Personally I'd go for Shining Armour and Cadance for Nathaniel and Beth if only for the line about "what good is love when it comes to the fight?".
<p></p>Twilight or Luna should work for the astronomer.

            @Kalloon: I know how that is.  I've been mulling over an original idea for a few years and I can't get all the details settled enough to actually start writing it.
<p></p>@Apple: That's overstating it; I don't think we've really been scared of getting in trouble for months now.  Everything's been perfectly fine for quite a while.  Heck,  I don't think any of the regular posters have even been thumped in the past few months.
<p></p>@Story: Yeah,  and only like 20% of it was actually relevant.  The rest of it was stuff like the tea party or whatever.

<p></p>And no new poni stuff to talk :/

            Yeah,  other threads aren't exactly on the precipice of disaster,  so why would this one be? The only one in recent memory that I can remember getting that bad was the LOK shipping thread,  which was either a great or terrible idea. I'm not exactly sure.

            I'm not going to name names,  but most of the in-thread drama was the result of a certain few posters who don't really post much anymore.  From what I've seen,  arguments in the thread have generally been rather civil,  so I really doubt there's anything to worry about unless somebody deliberately tries to piss off the mods.  And even in that case they'd probably just get whammied and the rest of us would be fine.

            If you mean the <em>The Last Roundup</em> debacle,  some <em>very</em> vocal minority got up in arms about the portrayal of Derpy potentially being offensive to retarded people. Oddly enough,  those people that <em>should</em> be offended by it actually... weren't.

            Derpy's current status in the show itself is unclear at the time. She's all sorts of popular in the merch,  though,  so she's probably never going away,  even if she never cameos again.

            What wigs me out about that is that one of my favorite episodes was damn near completely overshadowed (at least at the time) by the whole thing because of some overzealous moral guardians in the fandom.
