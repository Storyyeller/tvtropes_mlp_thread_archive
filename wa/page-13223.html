            This was almost the only episode I was going to skip because I don't like Discord. Though I do admit I had an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">Actually Pretty Funny</a> moment or two with rolling the eyes and candles.
<p></p>I still don't like Discord by Angel Bunny getting hurt made up for it. If the preview said "ohh and Angel gets hurt." I would've been saying "I am so there"
<p></p>I'm surprised Fluttershy managed to make it work.

            Something tells me this is going to be the most polarising episode yet...
<p></p>Also,  the writers either need to learn how to pace over 22 minutes better,  or somehow get longer episode lengths. I do love this episode,  but it's abruptness of the ending was irritating...

            I wonder whether the showrunners were planning to reform Discord all along,  or if this episode was a response to Discord's popularity among the fans.

            At first I thought the ending was a bit abrupt,  but thinking back there were a few spots before the end that he seemed on the path towards reformation.  I just wrote them off because he's a good enough actor and manipulator that it's <em>really</em> tough to tell when he's being sincere.
<p></p>And now,  a riddle for the ages: Who would win in a fight,  Discord or <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aladdin" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aladdin">the Genie</a>?

            I´m glad to see on twitter that so many people disliked this episode. See,  I´m not crazy!
<p></p>Now seriously,  I really didn´t like it. I wan´t expecting much but the episode itself was boring. And exactly what was Fluttershy "great performance"? She did NOTHING the entire episode. Nothing. And Discord suddenly deciding her friendship mattered was lame,  especially since she turned her back on him in a second.
<p></p>This episode sucks.

            <strong>Whatshis</strong> - thank you! Glad to know that next Saturday will <em>not</em> be free of a new episode. I knew that there was one that was out of order,  but I forgot about it. So this is the one that they said when we see it,  we'll know why it's delayed. I'm very curious.

            @Whatsis: Wait,  if Episode 8 appears out of order,  that would make this episode 10,  wouldn't it? so there are three episodes left?
<p></p>Unless I've missed an episode,  in which case...
