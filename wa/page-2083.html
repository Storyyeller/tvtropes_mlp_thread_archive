<p></p>@Mousa: Just had a thought. In most humanized!ponies pictures (I THINK in yours too?),  Spike is a human boy,  maybe with elf- or trolllike features. How would one handle this episode in such a context? Have him just become a huge troll? Could work just as well.

            Great episode. The part where Rarity covered Spike's mouth was the heartwarmingest thing ever.
<p></p>Also,  does this mean that non-greedy dragons don't grow up <em>at all?</em> That would be a good explanation to Rarity/Spike shipping: He <em>is</em> a baby dragon,  but in dragon terms,  this only means "a nice,  innocent,  generous dragon",  not necessarily immaturity.
<p></p>Also,  suddenly Wonderbolts.

<p></p>Neither did I,  but you can almost always Google a poorly worded laconic description only for the real trope to pop up.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">does this mean that non-greedy dragons don't grow up at all? </div>
I think that dragons are shaped by their emotions and personalities.
<p></p>Heroic!Spike would become a dragon knight,  insane!Spike would be a Dragonequus,  greedy!Spike is,  well,  you've seen this already.

            Started with the second season,  although I'm not sure if she showed up in the 2nd half of the pilot.  But I consider them to be one big episode anyway.
<p></p>As for the growth cycle,  I feel like the hoarding jumpstarts it,  but he'd age normally otherwise.  Like the hoarding triggers his growth hormones or something.  That's why all the hoarding dragons are jerks; they were too impatient to wait to grow normally and just jumped right to adulthood.  Sort of like willingly letting their hormones take over.

            I think the first real deliberate use of cameo Derpy in Season 2 was Luna Eclipsed? Could be wrong.
<p></p>Wow,  the great dragon speculations just keep coming @fran @Teeth! Sound nice!
<p></p>However,  the Draconequus thing REALLY confuses me. I  mean,  they are apparently a seperate species or breed,  if Cheerilee is to be believed but... is Discord one of them who somehow acquired his godhood? Is he a God who just took that form? I don't get it.

Discord might be the only one who looks like that,  but because the vast majority of ponies are out of the loop,  they identified him as a species.
<p></p>Also,  I'm pretty sure Derpy's appearance in Lesson Zero wrestling the Mayor was definitely intentional.

Also,  that triggers some <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> regarding the other dragons; hormoned!Spike didn't have any compunctions about basically robbing his friends,  so one has to think of whether those other dragons got their stuff from.

            @Teeth: Great Draconequus explanation!
<p></p>Also forgot about Lesson Zero!
<p></p>Well,  there is A LOT of Fridge Horror and other problems with our other two dragons (especialy the green one,  whom I still consider the most horrible villain of the series),  but at least most of their hoard was gems,  which we can now also headcanon as being like vegetables,  so that's not TOO bad. However,  just realized that the red one also had jewellery... Yeah,  definitly stole them.
<p></p>@Jawa: Also a possibility.
<p></p>@Mousa,  Thanks for the reply! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin"> Hmm,  that should have been something to ask your Tumbler/Blog/Thingy,  but I have no idea how that works and I think you have a huge backlog as is <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">.

            I like to imagine that Peeler and the PPD tried to confront Spike offscreen,  but just weren't able to put a dent in him because of his size. (I do reckon that they redirected him from raiding a school or something at some point though <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_wink.png" height="16" width="16" alt="wink" title="wink">.)
<p></p>Then Gravy Train suggested that they call in the Wonderbolts.
