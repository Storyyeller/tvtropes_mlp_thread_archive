            Sigh,  I really don't want to click the links again to copy the URL,  but all of them on that page are bad,  so just pick one...
<p></p>Also,  I seem to follow NSFW links more times that can possibly be called sane. I'm not sure if insanity is the product of clicking these links,  or the reason I click them in the first place though.

            You know,  what <em>really</em> freaked me out was that one picture of the Apple family devouring meat with bloodshot eyes. This is a LOT worse than it sounds,  so much that the first time I saw it,  I closed the tab before it had loaded halfway! It doesn't scare me as much now,  but still...

            I...I think I'm going to have fun exploring that page later today.  My relationship with creepy stuff is...undefined.  Sometimes I think it's awesome (see my avatar) and sometimes I'm a total pansy.

Oh,  and the world seems to be a mixture of Generation 4 and future-Generation 1. Also,  Spike has been kidnapped and taken <em>somewhere</em> (probably some part of the dragon-lands) for "re-education purposes" and thus,  starting and driving the plot-line. Plus,  it seems that there were six original bearers of the Elements of Harmony that got somehow corrupted in a way,  and also influence the plot.

            God,  I have no idea why,  but it seems that I get some weird enjoyment out of mind screwing myself,  with scary pictures,  or messed up storys,  or even by thinking some messed up things myself (e.g. A Dystopian future ala <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraveNewWorld" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraveNewWorld">Brave New World</a>,  but removing some of the flaws,  which I cannot truly argue against even though my every moral fibre screams that it is wrong) I'm sure this cannot be good for my sanity...

            OHHH Pony dreams I actaully had one....kinda,  it was  cross between a dream dream and a daycream I was only kinda half asleep.
<p></p>I was at work,  when suddenly a bright white light and the Mane 6 were standing there,  I went over,  and somehow (it being a dream) we all knew we couldn't understand each other without any of us saying anything,  so started getting into a charade's match trying to "talk" to them. Then some MIB types showed up and I wa trying to help them run,  when Twilight ported us all to a field. I think at some point we were walking through the local Wal-Mart looking for the toys to show them. Then I knew we needed to make sure more poeple knew about them before the military types made them disappear,  so went to the local schools and recruit all the kids (kept switching between Elementary and high school) to help protect the ponies while we tried to get everyone alerted....then I woke up

            @ Bagof  My problem with it is fact that Derpy and other backgrounds are in Mane Six age in my headcannon.  All parent ponies look little or more older.  Also similar colors are not reason to any blood relations (just look at canon families),  Dinkie and Derpy don't have single  scene togher to support any kind or relations.
<p></p>And fandom have that obsesion with turning everypony  into mother.
