            @ Kegi: For the map I just assume it doesn't show every settlement in Equestria. Besides we knew there were other nations from as early as Dragonshy I believe where the dragon was told to leave Equestria. Would be tricky if there was nowhere else for it to go.

<p></p>That is why I was wondering about "armed conflicts <strong>since the events depicted in Hearth's Warming Eve.</strong>"
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Well there was the whole Celestia-Luna fight. That seems like it'd be a major conflict. The thing with Sombra I doubt was settled in a day,  he had a whole empire and all. </div>
<p></p>I highly doubt that it involved more than just Celestia and Luna. Since we don't have any evidence that there were any supporters of Nightmare Moon,  the possibility of any civil war is not likely. As for Sombra,  all <em>we were shown</em> were the ponies suffering under Sombra and as we saw in the premiere,  they were more than happy to participate in vanquishing him.
<p></p>If you want to bring up this "History is written by the victors.",  well,  I can't say anything on that matter.

            The Crystal Ponies still accepted Sombra as their king until literally the last minute when he was defeated. It's pretty easy to assume they'd fight for him.
<p></p>I very much doubt there were no ponies who sided with Luna solely because they thought she'd win and wanted get rewarded for backing the winner.

            A lot of fanon I've seen for the Celestia/Luna conflict has it being an actual war,  but I've never thought that made much sense.  If Luna had enough support to have an army,  why did she feel so neglected she felt the need to rebel?

            Luna was really powerful as shown by the fact she was winning before Celestia used the Elements. She presumably wanted to be loved but settled for feared to gain support.

            Its possible Nightmare Moon may have had an army made up of other creatures. Griffons,  Diamond Dogs,  maybe even borrowing some changelings. Ursa Majors for those times you want to trash a city with a giant star-bear. Luna wanted love from her own ponies,  but how did the other races of the world view her?

            I'm too lazy to read through the entire discussion,  so I'm just going to leave my 2 cents here:
<p></p>1. There's no indication in canon that Luna and Celestia's conflict was an actual war.  All we know is that there was a conflict between the two of them that resulted in Celestia blasting Luna with the elements.  Aside from the initial cause and the outcome,  we have no clue how events played out and it's all up to headcanon whether it was war or a fight between the two of them.
<p></p>2. Just because Sombra ruled the Crystal ponies doesn't mean they liked or supported him.  If they did fight for him it was likely either due to mind control,  or because they were too scared to oppose him.  He could be king without them accepting him; he'd just have to be powerful enough to enforce his will on them.

<p></p><span class="blue">I think the Celestia-Luna fight was a personal one.  Luna wouldn't have <em>had</em> any followers since all she wanted was to screw over everyone,  and normal ponies wouldn't have the power to go up against them anyway.  In all likelihood they just had a one-on-one duel.</span>

            I could by them fighting in the past,  but after Celestia took over I couldn't see them doing much war stuff.  <em>Maybe</em> occasional conflicts with other species,  but I think it's all far in the past by the time the show happens.

            @ Pan: <strike> And then she does. She's forced to use the Elements of Harmony. Thus she's weaker. Otherwise she wouldn't have to do the whole banished to the moon thing.</strike>
<p></p>Edit: wait this isn't the argument at all. Facepalm
<p></p>I still think Celestia would confront Luna fairly quickly.
<p></p>@ JT: Exactly they don't have to like him. They just have to fear him. And they do,  it's ludicrous to think they wouldn't fight for him if he forced them.

Banishment was the best long-term solution,  as well as leaving the possibility for future redemption for Luna.

            @ Pan: How would Celestia even know she could use the Elements? Before then she's only used them with Luna. It makes far more sense that it'd be an act of desperation than her first resort.
