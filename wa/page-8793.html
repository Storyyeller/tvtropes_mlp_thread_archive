            I could see an episode where its a big family reunion festival.  And all the ponies families are there,  but Apple family is all depressed because mom and dad are missing,  then suddenly they appear near the end of the festival and everyone is happy.

            I think if the documentary is going to be honest they should touch on the Clopping thing but not focus on it.  Sweeping it under the rug probably isnt the best,  it'll just fester and gain momentum and take over some day.
<p></p>I think thats what happened with Furries,  we tried to keep it quiet but it eventually broke free and went on a rampage.

            @Turtlebutter  I wish for such episode for months.  It could be ocasion to introduce rest of families,  allow to return other and allow them intreact,   also it could allow character like Breaburn to return.
<p></p>@CDRW  Now Granny Smith is 20% cooler.

            @Death. Well,  that's not exactly fair. It depends on how it's done,  especially if it was before canon happened. I remember reading a short fic a while ago,  before season 2 premiered,  about Rarity that had her parents basically abandon/leave her and her sister(s). It's completely wrong now,  obviously. But it was well-done.<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> The fic was "Simply Rarity" if anyone was curious.</div></span> <br> <br>@ Turtle. I could get behind an episode like that. Might be a bit busy with a lot of characters,  though. <br> <br><div class="quoteblock">Hey,  wouldn't it be funny if Prince Blueblood fell for Applejack?</div>
No.

            I think if any of the Mane 6 started a relationship they'd become less flexible as a character.  They'd have less time to hang out with the others and stuff.  At least thats what has happened to most people I know who have gotten into a relationship,  they tend to put their friends on the backburner.

            I'd normally agree that I wouldn't want to see romance here,  but if there ever was a show that could make it work,  it would be this one.

            Hi,  I'm back,  to say that I'm going to leave the thread for at least a few days,  after embarressing myself like that earlier.  I'll lurk,  but I'm avoiding the conversations.  Give you all a break from my problems and antics.
<p></p>One last thing...I'm not sure about a mane 6 gets a boyfriend episode...but I'd love to see a mane 6 <em>tries</em> to get a boyfriend episode.  I even have a way for AJ to do it.
<p></p>Anyway...bye.

<p></p>Well,  it only adds <em>nothing</em> if it's done poorly. If done right it is a powerful tool for storytellers.
