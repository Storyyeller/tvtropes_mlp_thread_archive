            Kinda backtracking in the topic a bit,  but another point about the whole "Twilight should have been severely punished for what she did" thing that started this that I don't think was brought up. For all we know,  Celestia <em>was</em> going to pass <em>some</em> sort of judgement. Then the rest of the mane six barged in and begged her not to do anything to Twilight. I wouldn't doubt that that display moved her somewhat.
<p></p>Also,  if Celestia thought that Twilight needed to learn more about friendship,  then wouldn't taking her back to Canterlot and isolating her again be the <em>last</em> thing that she'd do?

            it's the fact that someone would go and assume that of COURSE the ponies must be evil and hate filled and all the crap humans deal with,  and they just don't show it,  despite the fact the very fact they are ponies makes that almsot ridiculous from any biological level.
<p></p>Humans are predators,  we evolved looking out for number one and our genetic relatives. but are smart enough that some of us can put those instincts down at times and go past them.
<p></p>Ponies are herbivorous herd animals. they have no reason to be wired to be as selfish,  greedy,  self-centered,  insular,  and distrustful as humans in the first place. Yes they have some issues like that, . but in those cases it the exact OPPOSITE of humans.
<p></p>Humans can sometimes overcome our negative basic instincts and nature via our intelligence. Ponies sometimes ignore there more benevolent instancts via there own intelligence. But as the very basic nature of ponies as as herd animals that are for more dependent on each other then humans are,  saying they'd be anywhere near as big of bastards as humans is just rediclous.

            I pretty much assume that their are some really bad areas in Equestria and that we don't get to see them,  but also that for the most part they wouldn't be any worse then what you see in the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperMario" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperMario">Paper mario</a> games,  or <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMarioBros" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMarioBros">Super mario bros</a> in general. Yes,  I know it's an odd comparision,  but what are you gonna do?

<p></p>Although I wouldn't be surpised if Equestria actually was a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack world</a> during the time period that Luna was banished,  but it got better over the decades. That's just my headcanon,  though.

            @Seraphem: Exactly,  that's why all the dystopian pony darkfic stuff just feels strange to me.  It's basically trying to turn the ponies into realistic humans,  which they <em>aren't</em>.  They're very similar,  but I think there's a difference there.  Although it might just be me being really picky.  I consider a story's place on the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVsCynicism" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVsCynicism">Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism</a> to be one of defining aspects of it,  and I'm not a fan of sliding it around much in either direction.

            I think MLPs have an overall more resilient mind than the average human.  Three catastrophically bad events including threat of dying slowly and painfully by running out of supplies that require a sun to produce and twice nearly enslaved by a crazed god and a shapeshifting queen respectively.  On top of that: nearly mauled to death by large,  horrific creatures?  Mind raped by Discord?  Turned into a dead piece of rock?  They shrug that mental trauma off like a boss.

<p></p>I can deal with darker fic and stuff like that long as the story itself is decent,  cause i just lumb all fics into AU's. Its when people start trying to make the cannon Equestria that way i get pissed.

            The ponies do seem rather unnaturally durable.  I mean,  if Twilight can get clobbered by a <em>piano</em> and be fine the next day...
<p></p>But seriously,  I think one of the fundamental differences between reality and Equestria is that Equestria seems to bounce back more from difficulties,  and progress seems to stick a bit better.  I mean,  the mane cast have repeatedly undergone things that would probably scar a human for life and they're fine.  The negative consequences aren't quite as massive because they have a faster recovery.

            @ Kuroi,  well there really wasn't time for the true horror of a night which never ends would bring,  they never reached the starvation phase,  or even the need to ration supplies phase. Realy the "never ending night" was little more then a single day. scary but not enough to really traumatize them.
<p></p>But the rest yeah,  they do tend to be more resiliant....to....mental...trauma.....
<p></p>HOLD ON
<p></p>Live a quite rural life
<p></p>Love gardening and making things grow
<p></p>Quite peaceful life with little major crime or nastiness
<p></p>All generally get along with each other,  though some frictions do arise

            Something to note is that the depicted political and cultural situation in Hearth Warming Eve wasn't exactly pretty. The ponies were jealous,  petty,  and overall Xenophobic,  only tenuously working together thanks to what was essentially MAD sans nuclear weapons. Earth ponies needed the sun and weather to grow their crops,  and the other two races needed said crops to live. If any one race were to cut out of the arrangement,  it would more or less spell doom for all three. They all still hated each other's guts,  though. Of course,  several thousand years later,  things are in much better condition,  but the historical precedent is still there.

            @Perpetual: True.  Although that still fits with the idea that forward progress just sticks more.  And even then the tensions between the races were portrayed more as mutual annoyance than "we're going to intentionally let the others starve to death".  I really have to wonder just how historically accurate that play was.  But yeah,  the world used to be a lot worse than it is now.
<p></p>Okay,  going to bed for real now.

            @Lurker: I like to imagine the fallout from the Love Poison Incident was what caused the Three Tribes to be so badly segregated. Pegasi instituted martial law to protect their kind from the "vile rumors" about the Love Poison,  Platinum took the crown while technically underage since her relatives were either down with the Poisoning or busy plotting too much,  and the Earth Ponies essentially took the brunt of bad administration badly and became separatists in that time.

            not really,  i'd bet. And it still plays into my "herd instincts" thing. it's just back then they only considered there tribe to be their "herd",  not all ponies.
