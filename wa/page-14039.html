            @Bad: Why does being in love make any difference? Yes,  it does add an unaccounted-for variable,  but assuming it's irrelevant is pretty much the same as assuming it's relevant at this point. There's no real evidence for either. We HAVE seen an earth pony stop an out-of-control bus,  pull a locomotive engine and cars,  wrestle a buffalo... all of which are pretty impressive.
<p></p>Plus,  depending on how you count the legitimacy of the books,  we've basically been outright <em>told</em> about their strength.

            Yeah,  I don't get why everyone assumes that the love potion also inexplicably involves a strength boost.  There's no reason for it to do so.  It's much easier to assume that he's just that strong,  and simply doesn't <em>use</em> that strength very often.
<p></p>Ditto with Cheerilee; she busts a hole in a wall that episode. I'm guessing she's normally capable of that,  she just doesn't <em>need</em> to most of the time.
<p></p>@Apple: It's not a case so much of "Something they can do that no other race can" so much as "no other race can match the <em>result</em>".  I mean,  Trixie and Rarity demonstrated that unicorns can do weather control; they just suck at it.

            @Badwolf: Even if that <em>is</em> the case,  the love poison obviously isn't the real deal.  That and I think that any love powerup would be more blatant; whenever a metaphysical powerup appears,  it's always in the form of a single,  explosive affect.  I.e. the elements blasting somepony,  the Crystal Heart activation,  the fires of friendship toasting the windigos,  Cadance and SA's uber love shield explosion; it's never appeared as a passive power boost.  The only exception is Chrysalis,  who as noted explicitly feeds on love and obviously processes it differently.

Didn't <em>Twilight Sparkle and the Crystal Heart Spell</em> outright say that earth ponies have greater strength? Also something about "pure hearts".

<p></p>I don't think it's reasonable to think that the love poison is doing the same thing,  even if love is magic.

<p></p>Also,  there's absolutely no basis for this,  but I like the headcanon idea that Celestia and Luna were EP's before they became alicorns.  Makes little sense,  but I like the idea of there being ascended EP's in the setting.

That smacks of stereotyping. <em>Positive</em> stereotyping,  but still.
