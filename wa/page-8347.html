<p></p>Alternate universe,  timeline separates during Nightmare Moon incident. Here Nightmare Moon was gone,  but Celestia and Luna ended traped in their celestial bodies,  those can't move on their own now,  but also Elements of Harmony got lost. Almost millennium later Equestria is less perfect and idealistic society,  but still pretty nice. Technologically more advanced,  while still with connection with magic. And involved in big war what was reason for it's downfall. When Equestria won war,  pony responsible for this success (Robotnik Expy) started his plot to takeover Equestia and world. With his deception,  allies,  army of robots,  technology and robotisation he take over most it,  and only few ponies and other creatures remained in untouched region,  forming resistance,  resulting in Sat AM like setting. For moment I was thinking that Robotnic Expy just like in Sat AM (or more like Archie comic) should be from diffrent species who was enemy of Equestia,  but I think it's should be pony. Also I was thinking about Zebras being said enemy race,  but we don't need more fics with Zebra nation as evil enemy. I was thinking about rest of characters being expy of Sat AM or MLPFIM character or both,  but I'm think character from FIM should remaind (as AU version). Twilight as Sally,  Rainbow as Sonic,  AJ as Bunny,  CMC as Tails. Not sure about other,  exept Disqord who would be like Ixis. Story could be close to Sat AM,  with no gore,  death and other adult stuff.

            @Death:
<p></p>Hopefully you'll be able to come up with roles for the rest of the mane cast to do. You remember Rosie,  from the "Blast to the past" two-parter,  right? Cheerlie might be able to fit that role,  given her status as a teacher and how I'm sure that you could expand on her charector as more then just a two-episode appearence {Or the fanfic equivelent of it}. Just a little idea,  that's all.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            I missed the S3 wishlist earlier due to having to go out before time to reply so:
<p></p><ul><li> Scootaloo episode.
</li><li> In addition I'd maybe like a bit more <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivergentCharacterEvolution" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivergentCharacterEvolution">Divergent Character Evolution</a> for the CMC,  they sort of have separate personalities,  but a lot of their episodes they almost seem to be interchangable.
</li><li> A Big Mac episode would be interesting to see work out,  even if it plays different to the one that was planned before.
</li><li> I agree with some more AJ stories,  especially personality centric ones,  she was a bit too much in the background last season. Some awesome moments would be welcomed too.
</li><li> Granted Rarity could do with some more awesome moments first. Hell how about some awesome moments for Spike? He's a baby sure,  but there must be <em>some</em> cool dragon stuff he can do.
</li><li> I agree with a previous comment about RD having some more <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moments,  more specifically however,  I'd like some moments where her own unique positive aspects come into play (it's cool she's the Element of Loyalty,  but it's not as if any other pony is a trecherous weasel). Hurricane Fluttershy did a decent attempt at this with her Determinator traits and Big Sis mode with Fluttershy so it would be cool to see some more <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>. That said still keep her as an aggressive braggart.
</li><li> RD and Pinkie prankster team again. This has to return somehow.
</li></ul><p></p>The <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatAm" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatAm">Sat Am</a> crossover sounds interesting,  just as long as you hold off from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Seasonal Rot</a> (eg. Twilight doesn't become a Canon Sue/Spotlight Stealer,  AJ doesn't become a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl">Faux Action Girl</a>).
<p></p>It's hard to really think of someone for Antoine,  he's a guy consisting nearly completely of negative traits which sorta goes against FIM's development,  unless you put a little of Archie's development in there. His Load qualities and some personality traits remind me a bit of Spike,  even if the latter has far more redeeming qualities.

I kinda liked how she seemed the most determined to get AJ back,  considering how they usually are.
<p></p>I admit Griffon The Brush Off gave at least something of a notable use of her Loyalty traits. While some may have had at least had some emotional conflict about who to choose,  RD had no doubt who her real friends were and used her tough girl persona to back Gilda off.

<p></p>I would stuff from Archie too,  but I'm much familiar with it.   And no,  I wouldn't never in any crossover ad bad things from show.  So no Dulcy and wasted potential of characters.

            @Death: Thanks for the compliment.
<p></p>Mixing "Blast to the past" with "Cutie mark chronicles"? I wonder how that would work out.
<p></p>I'm also wondering this: Your having RD take Sonic's place,  and Twilight take Sally's place,  correct? That kinda puts shipping implications in my head,  not that this is a bad thing per say.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
