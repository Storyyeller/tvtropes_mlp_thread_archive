            Remember,  Twi is both looking back on her brother through nostalgia goggles,  so maybe he wasn't AS godly as she made him out to be,  and I think that Cadance was replaced by the Queen at around the time the marriage was first announced

<p></p>except your making just as many,  your basing your criticism on what you assume..you even flat out said "assuming" your reaching just as much as anyone else. unless you have 100% of the cold hard facts of every single detail,  then any conclusion you draw based on incomplete data will be flawed.
<p></p>We just choose to pick the assumption that explain stuff without making ponies look stupid,  you seem to be going for the more negative assumptions.

            @Kayeka: When was there <em>any</em> indication that Cadence was only relaced for days. For all we know,  it could have been <em>years</em>!
<p></p>@Ginger: And I agree with you. I'm just saying thatI have a younger sister who's stronger than me,  so such things don't bother me.
<p></p>EDIT: For all we know,  Twilight <em>did</em> know that Shining Armour was dating Cadence. She didn't realise that she was the same pony as Princess Mi Amore Cadenza,  remember?

            So it isn't Ema after all? What a twist. I initially suspected that it wasn't really Ema,  but the game continued long enough that I thought it actually was. I wonder how to prove it.

<p></p>exactly my point,  proof? how do you know WHEN they switched? how long SA and Cadance had been dating? Does everyones big brother keep there little sister up to date on who there dating? we don't know. Except we choose to give them the benefit of the doubt that is a good reason we just don't know becuase we know we don't know the whole stroy.

<p></p>Oh,  come on! The queen couldn't even not act bitchy for a single day,  let alone for years,  no matter what kind of Glamour she'd have.
<p></p>Not to mention that Cadence was actually aware of a wedding happening,  and sings about having looked forward to it. They couldn't have switched sooner than after she agreed to the marriage.

            Well I just finished the entire thing.  Overall I thought it was pretty darn good.  I liked the fact they introduced a proper villain for the finale and brought some element of danger to the proceedings.  I think that it was a bit of a mistake by those who got an early viewing of the episode  to suggest that the finale was on par with a Disney epic though.  It wasn't,  and that raised expectations a bit too high,  I think.   Unfortunately,  I spoiled myself a bit by hanging around here a bit longer than intended while watching part two and learned of Cadence's true nature as the Changeling Queen.

            It's probably a good thing that I came into the episode without holding it to any preconceptions. Just sit back and enjoy the ride,  for whatever it turns out to be.
<p></p>And honestly,  it feels like one of the most enjoyable episodes I've watched this season,  or the entire series even. I can probably still find a couple things to nitpick,  but overall it was just... amazing.
