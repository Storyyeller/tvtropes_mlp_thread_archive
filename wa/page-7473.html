            @Mio Yes. I enjoy villains because they're entertaining,  not because they're evil. I find their evil entertaining but the physical ACT of being evil isn't what I like.

<p></p>My employer is a crafty person.
<p></p>We get 'paid' breaks...meaning those little fifteen minutes are not deducted from our wages.  However,  that means we're still on company time...so breaks are given at his discretion.
<p></p>It's an abuse of a loophole.

            @Kyler: Very simple actually. When villains are being evil it is simply a function of their role in the story. Thus when the heroes act evil it is a much bigger turn off.

            @Kyler I laughed at ASOIAF when a 5 year old got his head smashed in with a mace.
<p></p>I laughed,  not because I thought the death of that child was funny,  but because it was abrupt,  and the people commiting it were SUPPOSED to Complete Monsters and unrepentent assholes. It didn't EXPECT me to sympathize with them.

            Because when a villain does something wrong,  you know it's wrong. It's when you don't know that it's wrong,  when the story says that maybe this wrong thing is right,  it's a bit of a trickier issue? I mean,  it's just because you were supposed to agree with Scoots,  right?(Bearing in mind I have no idea what's goingo n,  I'm just making guesses based on what I know of Ginger)

            @Kegi because ultimately,  Scootaloo was treated as a force for good. It expected us to like and to smpathize with her (she even becomes kind of a role model for Pip)
<p></p>Evil doing Evil,  I an comprehend and enjoy. Evil doing good,  I can get behind too.
<p></p>Good doing evil I just can't accept unless they're punished SEVERELY for it. Scoots died eventuall but she wasn't PUNISHED or called out on what she did. She didn't think she was wrong. Her death would've happened whether she'd done it or not.

            Mm... the rare times when he does get a moment of sympathy are when he's <em>not</em> actively murdering something horribly... although it's trying to give more depth to his murder,  which is questionable.
<p></p>The artists other comic,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeastICouldDo" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeastICouldDo">Least I Could Do</a> is a bit of a better example. the protagonist is a selfish,  assholish man child,  and the comic seems to want to paint him as in the right. Whenever it does it becomes obnoxious and irritating,  to say the least.

            @Steve: Best I can figure is: The party has found their mythic city,  managed to defend it from an invading army. Richard has to go on some quest through a contract of some sort. Meanwhile the orc(Who's name escapes me) is trying to find some hidden library,  and the elf is off to try and rescue Richard.
<p></p>It's not so bad if you don't try and hammer out <em>all</em> the nuances.

            @kegi She locked up all the ponies she PERSONALLY blamed for the war and said she'd keep them there and that none of them would be let out... ever. Even if the surface turned back to normal the stable would remain locked. The doors of that stable would never open until every soul there was dead (and bear in mind she was expecting the nigh-immortal goddesses to be in there too)
<p></p>All as a petty,  pointless act of revenge.

<p></p>Well,  that does seem a bit... pointless. I mean,  what good is that going to do,  the damage is already done. All she's basically doing is petulantly damning them. Not to mention punishing Celestia unduly,  since she's the only one who would survive.
