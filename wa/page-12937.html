            Thanks for the name of the trope everyone.
<p></p>Yeah if I were Twilight IÂ´ll be all "Hey what gives? Yo go into Scootaloo dreams but you let me be all terrified of a zebra? Thanks a lot Princess!"
<p></p>I know its silly headcanon but it bothers me and hey,  half of you believe the clones of Pinkie were alive when the episode showed they lacked her memories and later they were incaple of saying anything other than funfunfun. It was pretty obvious they were simply magical copies with no soul.
<p></p>But its cool. In the name of friendship check out this lovely video

            again...what? She only spoke up to Scoots after her second nightmare in as many nights,  seeing a pattern and helping her get to the source of them. She doesn't just make nightmares go away,  she tries to help you find the underlaying cuase of them at stop them that way.
<p></p>no secret reason for her having a single bad dream about something that just happened that would require Luna to help Twi.

            And what does that have to do with being scared of her? Large,  royal pony with the power to crush you under hoof swoops into down on a carragie from hell and begins screaming at you...
<p></p>...that's got nothing o do with them thinking she's NMM,  that has to do with her just plain scaring the crap out of them.

            Sorry Enlong I have no idea what that game is,  and donÂ´t game me a rough time I have plenty of game I havenÂ´t played so no idea what you are trying to tell me.
<p></p>Yeah that is a funny one too. Actually CR from Familiar Faces has a really funny half hour rant about how Luna eclipsed is a horrible episode. See IÂ´m not the only one who rants about something the show never really explains. I mean what is the deal with Nightmare Night? Did Celestia let her sister become a mosnter? How come nopony knew that Princess Luna was Nightmare Moon? How come nobody tell them after she returns? Agh too many questions! My head hurts!
<p></p>Well I better call it a night,  its really late on my country. DonÂ´t get the wrong impression I had fun today. I knew you werenÂ´t going to agree with me or anything.You just asked which episode I didnÂ´t like and its that one which aside from the Luna problem is a pretty good Scootaloo episode. Now how did Rainbow Dash was the only one who hear Scootaloo was in danger and she was wearing earplugs at the time...argh I did it again! Sorry!

<p></p>OF COURSE she would freak out everypony on Nightmare Night :V

            The only ponies that we ever see actaully act like she IS NMM,  and not just fucking terrifying in he own right,  are Pinkie,  who knows she's not and thinks shes just pretending to be to get in the NMN spirit and was playing along
<p></p>And Flutershy,  who is terrfied of EVERYTHING associate with NMN and was way to stressed to be thinking clearly.

            Clearly the others were scared because Luna was much louder and more in-your-face than Celestia,  and they're not used to it,  especially the Royal Canterlot Voice.

            o hai Orion.
<p></p>Some folks here wonder why y'all were scared of Luna that other Nightmare Night when she first showed up personally.
<p></p>...Come to think of it I don't remember whether we asked you anything about this year's Nightmare Night.
