<p></p>Windigo just looks better to me. Also,  if you know the actual story of the Windigos,  it's pretty trippy.

            Twilight is best pony,  Fluttershy and Rarity round out the top three,  and the rest of mane cast gets shuffled around depending on my mood at the time.
<p></p>The thing with the AJ/RD battle is that while RD is way faster,  I think AJ is both more durable and stronger.  RD would probably have to nail AJ a couple times to hurt her,  while AJ could probably knock RD out cold with one good kick.  And AJ has shown the capability to lasso RD in flight,  so I think they're probably even.
<p></p>Also,  I still don't get the issue with Twilight; she is really powerful,  but she's hardly a deus ex machina.  As often as not her magic makes the situation worse.
<p></p>Anyway,  what do you think would happen if Celestia got hit with Poison Joke?

On the other hand this isn't the kind of series where a character's "power level" will really have a significant impact on what happens in the show. In fact her "power level" and personality will probably mean that she will get her flank handed to her more often then not (especially if it's funny).

<p></p>If Mousa got hit with PJ...I think her horn would go limp,  her wings would flip upside,  and she would shrink down to a tiny size.  In other words...PJ is even more deadly to her than to a normal pony.
<p></p>Also,  the PJ those agents were using is a super fast acting <em>mutant</em> PJ...effects take hold in seconds,  not a day.

<p></p>So,  it's kind of like "Moammar Khaddafi, " in that there's really no right or wrong way to spell it. I'll just leave it as-is,  then.  Thanks.

            @ pvtnum 11,  Poison Joke makes random magical effects happen.  It was the episode where zecora appeared and Twilight's horn went floppy,  Applejack shrunk,  Fluttershy became Flutterguy,  Pinkie Pie's tongue swelled,  Rainbow Dash couldn't fly straight,  and Rarity...I don't remember what happened to her.

            Hold on there Fran,  I think that's a bit of a class issue,  isn't it? Like in D+D,  a sorceror can only take a certain amount of skills because those are the spells they're sort of 'born' with (bear in mind here my knowledge of D+D is fairly minimal,  largely relegated to what I absorbed when building in the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverWinter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverWinter">Never Winter</a> engine for school),  but a Wizard can learn any spell because they get them by learning. So in essence having 'magic' for a cutie mark means that your a wizard as opposed to the unicorns base sorcerer; you can learn any spell you like,  but you have to <em>learn</em> them. And to be fair Twilight did learn most of those spells through study,  rather than through just intuitively knowing them.
<p></p>Honestly,  the whole 'you only get magic that relates to your talent' thing sort of bothers me. There are spell books - lots and lots of spell books,  full of different sorts of spells. There are <em>classes</em> of spells. How common would magic as a special talent have to be for that? What I think it means is that there are a few spells you happen to know as an intuitive knack - as in,  an actual <em>talent</em>. A unicorn could still learn a spell with study the way Twilight does,  they just happen to know one or two right off the bat in a way a person who is naturally gifted at art knows one or two tricks intuitively. Twilight's 'talent' in magic just happens to be her hack-level power.

            @Kegisak: Yeah,  my take on unicorn magic isn't that Twilight has hax-level "I can learn any spell including those that other ponies can't".  I've always assumed that any unicorn can learn any spell,  including those they aren't inherently talented in,  but Twilight is just better at it.  Like how anyone can learn mathematics if they put the time in,  but some people are just better at it than others.

            Yeah,  but Twilight has been wrong about magic before. Almost consistently,  in fact,  for somepony who allegedly studies it.  To be honest I take a lot of what's <em>said</em> in the show with a bit of a grain of salt. If it's show,  that one thing,  but if it's only said... well,  they could be lying,  or wrong.
<p></p>It just doesn't make any sense that a unicorn can only have certain kinds of magic,  and then all of a sudden a pony comes along and say "oop,  looks like I can do <em>every kind of magic</em>!" It feels almost mary sue-ish. Especially when you consider how often Twilight lectures on how <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">Magic A is Magic A</a>,  for her to come along and suddenly be magic B just doesn't make sense in universe. I think it's still possible that when she said that she meant that they start off with a bit of magic related to their particular knack. Especially since I can't think of <em>any</em> way the system could work that some ponies would just get a spell,  but then other ponies would have to work for their spells,  but could get any one. It only makes sense if <em>any</em> pony can get <em>any</em> spell,  but have a hard time of it. Like Jteeth said - some people may have a knack for certain feilds,  but any person can pick up any skill if they try hard enough.

            Speaking of Boast Busters,  it makes me feel sorry for Twilight when people are angry with her character for being really good at magic,  considering she sacrificed pretty much everything else in the pursuit of her studies. It's like,  it's what she <em>thought</em> her friends would be like in Boast Busters,  before she was informed that nobody was that petty.

<p></p>I kinda like that thought. And after all,  trying really hard at magic is basically her life.
