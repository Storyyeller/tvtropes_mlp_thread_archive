Oh,  really? I was okay with those. Guess I won't see the problem,  then.

            Personally I don't like when reading a Fanfic for one of the characters to constantly be waving a sign at me saying "HEY,  HEY! REMEMBER YOU'RE READING A FANFIC?"

            Honestly,  I think that all the canon characters are slightly...off. But Pinkie's is the most extreme and RD's the second most extreme.
<p></p>As I've said over and over again,  this author is AWESOME when it comes to designing <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs">O Cs</a> and worldbuilding,  but his portrayel of canon characters is less than perfect. I really think that he would make awesome original fiction. We should let him know. And also let him know that his future fanfics should focus on <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCs">O Cs</a> as much as possible.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>EDIT: I think that Merriwether Williams gets a bad rap. I liked her episodes,  but I'll admit that she has a tendency to ramp jerkassness,  especially in RD up.
<p></p>As for the fourth wall stuff,  I think that it has a time and place and that place isn't in a gripping adventure drama.

            @Bad I wouldn't find it so bad if the 4th wall crap wasn't a PLOT POINT.
<p></p>Apparently,  because <strong>I</strong> find Pinkie's antics SO hilarious,  she has superpowers,  and the reason she can't just conjure food for them is because <strong>I</strong> wouldn't find it funny or joyful. -_-
<p></p>What an absolute crock of shit

            @Ginger: Interpret it this way,  she can only do things that <em>she</em> finds funny. It becomes easier to tolerate and then if you disagree,  she clearly is drawing her power from her own poor taste.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>EDIT: Though I must admit,  her powers aren't very much unlike those of a power ring from Green Lantern. Extremely powerful,  but dependant on emotion. Red Velvet's aren't very different.

            @ Ginger,  stop taking everythng so personal
<p></p>as to MW ok I loved HWE,  but MMDW and PYHD both ha the same issue,  s/he (still not sure which) puts the story he watns to write ahead of keeping it feeling like the other episodes. he tends to just have ponies,  esspecially the non-mane-6 acting in whatever way will be best for his story,  no matter how OOC it seems. And he's the biggest reason for the upsurge in RD is a Jerass opinions.
<p></p>Anyone ANYONE that wants to write anything involving RD needs to sit down and watch Hurricane Fluttershy before-hoof.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">wow..that really makes sense..lso like he said Ginger it's not what YOU would find funny,  it's what Pinkie THINKS you'd find funny which is just whatever she would find funny.

            @Ginger,  if you want you can always send me a PM or an email,  I'll gladly pass on criticisms :P Honestly I think he'd like constructive criticism since most of the time we don't really get any real interesting discussions in the doc chats or in the comments... those that do are few and far between sadly.

            @Sereg: That's really not an accurate comparison. The Green Lantern rings do have limits beyond their dependence on a particular emotion and they don't just allow anything to happen. . .most of the time.

            well like we've all said,  he is AMAZING with his OC's and world building,  just needs to work on keeping the established ponies in character.
<p></p>And well,  if you've been around at all you know ginger and Pinkie have a...rather peculiar relationship.
<p></p>PYHD was way better then MMDW,  but a lot of the non-Mane-6 ponies still felt a bit off,  and way more jerkish then they should.
<p></p>of course we could always attribute that to it being how Fluttershy sees it...
