            "Born with a silver spoon in your mouth"?
<p></p>If having a silver spoon in your moth means to be in a life of luxury,  then <em>being</em> the Silver Spoon presumably would mean you provide said luxury. Or,  that's my reasoning at least.

            I'm wondering how the hay these ponies even get such apropos names in the first place? They describe the personality perfectly,  but they clearly aren't given them after getting marks because they have the exact same names before they got them. The only thing I can think of is the parents have some way of glimpsing the future through an oracle or some such which assigns names to the ponies. But the only ponies who even have slight abilities of that nature are Pinkie Pie and Celestia.
<p></p>Pinkie can only know things in the immediate future via Pinkie Sense so that rules out long-term predictions. And Celestia according to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word Of God</a> only has urges and "huh,  maybe I should try that" kind of hints so they're most likely vague and nonspecific guesses. So I'm stumped.

<p></p>Generally only background ponies get the really descriptive names. And there's nothing proving that those are the names they were born with.

            I have a feeling that if you were born with a name like "Butterfly Kisses" and end up with a Squirrel or something for a cutie mark... you just change your name to fit it.

            Some of them are named because of physical characteristics that would be present at birth,  such as Pinkie Pie,  Rainbow Dash and Pumpkin Cake (she's pumpkin colored,  and unlike her brother,  she doesn't have any pumpkin-related hobbies or personality traits).  Others seem to have a bit of family theme naming,  like with the Apple family or the Cakes (and Twilight and her brother both have a part of their name that relates to light).
<p></p>Other than that,  I can't really think of a Watsonian explanation for why many of them have names that fit characteristics that wouldn't be apparent at birth aside from psychic powers.  I have read some people mention the idea that the pony's future cutie mark shows up for a little bit and then fades soon after birth,  but that raises the question as to why the parents of the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs">CM Cs</a> (at least Sweetie Belle's parents have been shown) wouldn't just tell them what their kids' cutie marks are.  Although one could also make the argument that no one is allowed to tell their child what their cutie mark will be because it wouldn't allow the child to discover it on his/her own.  On the other hand,  one would think that there would be at least some parents who wouldn't be able to hide a secret like that from a foal who was very curious.
<p></p>The Doylist explanation,  of course,  is that the ponies have had meaningful names since the series began in the 1980s,  and the writers didn't expect that there would be older fans in the 2010s who would ask questions like that (they probably assumed that the intended audience wouldn't think of such questions).
<p></p>On the question of whether or not ponies change their names,  about the only example I can think of is Aunt Applesauce from Apple Family Reunion who used to go by a different name,  and Pinkie being called Pinkamena Diane Pie as a filly.  In Pinkie's case,  her usual name is a nickname that has gotten to the point that probably most Ponyville citizens don't necessarily know her original name.  In the case of Aunt Applesauce,  that's probably a nickname too going by the way Granny Smith told the story.

            The appallingly appropriate names are really only fans' conjecture more than anything. Among the mane cast,  <em>none</em> of them have names that fit their occupation save for Applejack(Gee,  apple-themed name in a family that's famous for growing apples,  what a shocker). Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy both have names that fit their personality,  which is understandable as both personality traits would be easily visible form birth-on(Particularly given horses can stand and walk and run pretty much right out of the womb). Twilight and Pinkie Pie can both be said to be named for their appearance(And Twilight is questionable in that case),  and Rarity's name is only tangentially related to her career,  and not at all related to her appearance - though it does fit her adopted persona.
<p></p>Among he supporting cast,  Sweetie Bell's name is also fairly unrelated to her,  Scootaloo can also be accused of being an early-personality name and Big Mac and Applebloom have the same excuse as Applejack. Cheerilee's name is completely unrelated.
<p></p>The only times appropriate names are used are for,  as said previously,  very minor characters and toys,  who the writers and Hasbro couldn't be tossed to name properly.
