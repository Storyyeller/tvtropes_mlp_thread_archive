            @Chadaman that is NOT why I like it. Fallout Equestria could practically stand up on its own without assistance from either series canon which is a huge plus in my book for crossovers. Also The worldbuilding is amazing,  the plot is straightforward and yet incredibly deep,  the characters are relateable and quite enjoyable.

            I'm starting to sound like a broken record here,  but I might have actually wanted to read this if it didn't hinge so much on horrible things happening to the canon characters. It's one thing for the canon characters to be the main characters and to have bad things happen to them,  because then you get to see their thoughts and how they cope. When they <em>aren't</em> the main characters,  and everything that happens to them is a forgone conclusion,  it holds no value to me. Instead,  it <em>detracts</em> vale for me,  as their fates are simply plot devices and shock value as opposed to the core of the story.

            Yeah,  I have precisely zero reason to read FE.  I think the dark elements just move it too far away from the tone of the show.  If you change stuff so much,  it isn't really MLP anymore.
<p></p>@Steve: See,  my question is that in that case why not just make it an original work?  The fanfic I like are the ones that explore the stuff from the source material and see what happens when you extend it.  FE just jettisons too much canon for me to be interested.  Like I look at how the world is described and I just can't reconcile it with the canon MLP universe.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Also this.  And from what I've heard,  I don't know if the actions of the canon cast members in FE can possibly fit the canon characterizations.

            @Lurker Well,  each member of the mane cast has a fairly interesting arc that moves across the story,  and their ends are delivered with at least some amount of satisfying pathos. None of them suffer JUST for the sake of suffering.

            @Ginger: The problem is that I can't get that sort of thing to match up with what we already know of the characters.  Take Scootaloo's...incident.  When I read stuff like that I can't help but react with "Scootaloo <em>would not do that</em>."  Unless it explains in detail how she went from her canon characterization to doing that sort of act,  I simply can't buy that it's supposed to be the same character.  And that goes from <em>any</em> canon character.  If it were entirely built on OC's I <em>might</em> be able to read it under the understanding that it's a dark AU version of the setting,  but the fact that it apparently plays itself as following from canon keeps it from working.

            FO:E IS Dark,  but it is not Grimdark,  what darkness it has it uses as a tool,  not just for the sake of being dark. The overall story is VERY in tune with the main FIM,  at least in the broadest themes,  yes some nasty stuff happens,  but the overall theme of FO:E is hope. that no matter how deep and pervasive the darkness,  how unending it seems,  all it takes is the smallest spark of hope to banish it. Really the best way to sum up the overall feel of FO:E is with Tolkien
<p></p>Sam: It's like in the great stories,  Mr. Frodo... the ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger,  they were,  and sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy? (...) Those were the stories that stayed with you... that meant something,  even if you were too small to understand why. (...) Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back,  only they didn't. They kept going... because they were holding on to something!
<p></p>Frodo: What are we holding onto,  Sam?
<p></p>Sam: That there's some good in this world,  Mr. Frodo... and it's worth fighting for.
<p></p>this right here pretty much sums up FO:E entirely.

            tbh,  only 2 characters act OOC (and one of them is purely based off of my headfanon)
<p></p>Celestia and Scootaloo.
<p></p>Scootaloo is the only character who acts NOTHING like her show counterpart. but the others are actually nailed pretty well.

            @Seraphem: It has nothing to do with the level of darkness itself; I'm fine with darkness (I've read <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Berserk" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Berserk">Berserk</a>,  for goodness sake).  It's the fact that the darkness just doesn't fit into MLP's universe without making it seem heavily OOC for all involved.  From what I know of the fic,  almost all the canon characters have done stuff that I just can't imagine them doing.  And that utterly breaks things for me.  Unless the fic in question is a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackFic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackFic">Crack Fic</a>,  the cast needs to be in character.
