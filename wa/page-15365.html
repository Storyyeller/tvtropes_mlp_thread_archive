            Which pony from the actual series would I be?  Maybe Derpy,  although my personality doesn't necessarily match what was shown of her in the actual show.  She and I both have blond hair,  I have brown eyes (close enough to her orange/yellow eyes),  and when I was 10 I had one eye that was drifting but that was corrected with surgery but it's still something I had in common with her at one point in my life.  Also,  I used to be mistaken for a boy (or called a boy as a mean joke) when I was a young girl because I've almost always had short hair,  like how Derpy's voice actress thought she was a boy at first.

            @darkabomination: I think what others may consider to be work might actually be fun for Applejack,  at least in some ways.  Apple Family Reunion was a good example of that,  where she thought "fun and exciting" equalled doing things fast and being active and busy,  plus she seemed to consider the barn raising to be fun (and she actually made it fun for her family as well in the process).
<p></p>That does bring up something interesting,  that I think has been mentioned before: what would Applejack do if she had a day (or part of a day) that was completely free of any farm work or anything that she was required to do.  I would imagine she would be the type to make things as a hobby,  like the baking she does sometimes.  Or as was mentioned,  she might find herself to be surprised and confused as to what to do with herself if she couldn't do any of her usual jobs and farm work.
<p></p>Perhaps she might end up trying to help her friends with their chores or whatever activities they were doing.  Another idea would be a hospital-type episode similar to Read it and Weep where Applejack is injured and has to depend on others to do her usual chores.

In pathfinder I think Fighters get a new feat every level or two,  which over time could potentially lead to someone pretty fucking stacked. Especially if you go [1] Human.</div>
<p></p>The consensus I've seen from veteran char op people is that Pathfinder fixed the worst abuses in 3.5ed but did nothing to address the underlying balance,  and if anything,  the lack of supplemental metrial makes it harder to build viable pure martial characters.
<p></p>Also,  Fighter feats are pretty much worthless,  and there's a lot less to chose from in Pathfinder. The most notable problem though is that there's no Warblade. Warblade is basically the fixed version of Fighter in 3.5 after WOTC realized how badly they'ed screwed up. But it's not core so it never got officially ported.

            Huh. That's odd then,  because 27 attacks per turns sounds <em>pretty</em> broken to me. Then again,  I've yet to get up to such a level,  so it could wind up being not as bad as all that. I mean,  I'm pretty sure by multiclassing you can get yourself some pretty nuts stuff going on. Like a monk/cleric. Cleric spells to increase physical attributes,  plus bonus from taking a god who's chosen weapon is unarmed strike. Punch stuff until it isn't there anymore. And apparently you can take vows to make the whole thing ever worse...
<p></p>Yeah,  I don't have much experience in breaking characters as of yet,  admittedly.

<p></p>Well if you head over to the Giant In The Playground forums,  the people with lots of experience will quickly tell you how things actually are.
<p></p>Anyway,  27 attacks in Pathinfinder sounds like it probably relies on dubious interpertations of the rules. You can do that with pretty much anything. I remember one thread that claimed to be able to get 3 million attacks per round. But the thing is that stuff like that are theoretical exercises that have no effect on how the game is actually played. The Tier system on the other hand represents a real and fundamental flaw in game balance that will ruin the game if you're not careful.
