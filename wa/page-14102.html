            No becuase her making it is IC for her,  and no reason not to. it's imply her explanation for why she choose to do so was missing or off. The only one who behaved like an idiot at all was RD,  who even then,  doing something like that was fully IC for her.

            To me,  Dash doesn't need a reason to drink the potion because it's awesome, ... because that's perfectly in her character. What bothers me is that Twilight STATES that she has no idea what her new potion does!!  Why make something if you don't know why you're doing it??

            @seraph Still I can't imagine why she would want a potion like <em>that</em>. (Though maybe she wanted to help someone like Snowdrop?) And that whole "kindergarten project" thing was kinda far-fetched.

            I thought Twilight wasn't sure what the potion would do because somewhere along the way,  it reacted in a way she wasn't expecting. (Trollface smoke fumes,  anyone?)

            @Morning: That's explainable in that the episode was already really far along in production when "Magic Duel" and "Magical Mystery Cure" came out,  so they wouldn't have had a chance to add references to those things.
<p></p>@Seraphem &amp; Shota: It is in character,  but it's the absolute bare minimum of justification for it,  and it's definitely not enough to base the entire episode one. Like I said in the review,  it wouldn't have taken much; just one or two more lines to make it clear that they have reasons for doing it other than "why not?"
<p></p>And what irked me more about the potion explanation is that Twilight says she doesn't know what the potion does... and then explains it two minutes later.  You could interpret it as "I don't know exactly what it does,  but here's what I think it is",  but it comes across more as "Twilight has no idea what she's doing,  and then suddenly has the information."

            True.  In the canon show,  Dash would consider that Twi's her friend and that being obstructive inside her own home would probably not be considerate.

            Well i took her "I don't know what it does" as simply her not having tested it yet. She knew what it was <em>supposed</em> to do,  but had no way of knowing if it <em>actually</em> would have that effect,  or what else could happen if it was used.

<p></p>Okay so is it possible for the staff ('cept Zachery natch) to redo parts of the episode then?

            The pacing. Good God.
<p></p>This is the exact same problem <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLooneyTunesShow" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLooneyTunesShow">The Looney Tunes Show</a></em> has! Even if the jokes SHOULD WORK because they're just written well,  a poorly-edited version of it in animation can completely kill it.  Characters say a line,  then stop,  then stand,  then an action occurs,  then another line is said!  Guess what?  Thats boring to watch! Lines aren't supposed to be separated by 10-second-long cold spaces!  Scenes need to flow into one another!
<p></p>I love this fan episode,  but purely for the whole endeavor.  Audiences expect to see a visual language in film,  and that language is extremely hard to understand and get right. Japaneseteeth's reviews proves that even the canon show isnt perfect with their pacing,  but at least it's better than THIS!

<p></p>Well it's firmly within uncanny valley as 3d cartoon ponies usually are,  but it's amazing that they took the trouble to animate the entire thing. That must have taken forever.
