            'kay,  thanks for the comments on my analysis. I was going to reply to some of them,  but then realized that I now had enough material to incorporate it into a part two of the analysis,  so give me a few days for that because I really shouldn't have the time to write that now.

            My theory is that since Star Swirl is an expert mage,  his spells are designed for ease of use.  Or at the very least,  Twilight is on the same wavelength he is and is able to figure out his spells easily.
<p></p>Also,  I agree that the time travel stuff is quite limited in the setting.  That's honestly part of the reason I'm not big on Dr. Whooves.  The stuff concerning him that isn't <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrWho" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrWho">Doctor Who</a> shoutouts is usually time travel,  and I just don't feel like easy time travel fits into the setting.

            IMHO,  time magic should be (very) limited in any setting.
<p></p>I do like Doctor Who,  watch it regularly,  but time travel is UGH...  I always end up hating myself every time I am compelled to apply any bit of logic to time travel.
<p></p>Like with Harry Potter,  I was (facepalm) when time magic showed up in this 'verse so I am very much glad that we only saw it used once (so far),  just like in HP.

            Well it also explains why Celestia usually restricts the library wing with Star Swirl's works in it,  she doesn't want just any pony to potentially cast magic that could undo thousands of years of harmony retroactively.
<p></p>Of course,  Twi must have already been of really high standing for the guards to give her clearance to open the door on-sight. That and they know the guard captain's little sister.
<p></p>@JT: most fictional time travel has restrictions for ease of author. Even the White Chronicle can only work on the timeline of its bearer from the moment they receive it,  and Homura's Wish restricts her to the timeframe around the period she met Madoka.

<p></p>Time magic is like white elephant in room.  Once a 'verse says it's possible,  I always end up wondering why Voldemort and especially any of Doctor Who's (many many many) enemies not use time travel for their foul ends.

<p></p>Um. Discord <em>could</em> use time magic. He demonstrated it to Twilight in Return of Harmony part 2. And it explains how he knew somuch about the girls. He <em>was</em> using time magic to his advantage. But time magic can't do everything.

            I really don't like having the Doctor in the verse. He really just doesn't fit very well and seems to only be there  out of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule Of Cool</a>. However,  I will make an exception of the audio dramas as I think their done well enough that I can take it face value.
<p></p>As for Who,  I really think time travel has been mostly underused for the most art. It's treated more like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>  rather than genuine time travel and it's related tropes. You could replace half the instances of using the word with magic and nothing would be at all different.
<p></p>At least <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a> grounds time travel in a bit of realism so it doesn't feel cheap.

            Discord doesn't tamper with history because it is boring to him :V there's more fun in shaping the unpredictable future.
<p></p>Also I read some of the neat stuff in The Science of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Discworld" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Discworld">Discworld</a> and they do talk about time machines at one point and how theoretically  physics does not prevent closed-time loops,  but most proposed time machines have the shared weakness of being unable to take you to <em>before the machine was made</em>.
