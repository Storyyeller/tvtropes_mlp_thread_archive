<p></p>I saw this similarity too,  exept  Changelings are cooler that Wraith and  ponies are definitely cooler than Ancients (who are second my most hated Sci FI race).

            not the ONLY,  but I loved it,  and yes we know it goes against you Celetis head cannon
<p></p>though at least your not as bad as that one writer on Fim-fiction that through a massive rant about how the show is dead,  it's magic gone totaly and uttter trash that's horrid all becuase her head fannon of Celestia being basically GOD and completely omnipotent got trashed by her getting defeated by Chrysalis. I mean ye Goddesses does she take some MASSIVE assumptions and treat them as fact.
<p></p>Appearntly that book from the very first episode was the pony Bible (litteraly)
<p></p>Some how  Luna turning into NMM was how evil got introduced to ponies
<p></p>all these ideas about how EVERYTHING in season 1 all served to build up this huge religious iconography all centered around Celestia.
<p></p>Oh and she appeartly has proof the Lauren was forced out of the show by Hasbro becuase Hasbro wnated to wreck the show,  gut it of magic and JUST sell toys (cuase you know they asked them to put a train in the show)

            Ginger,  lame by your standards. I thought it was awesome,  and yes i know WHY you disliked it,  that's why YMMV exists.
<p></p>I've got a Fluttershy,  RD,  and Cheerilee from Mcdonald's,  and I plan on getting the NMM/Vinyl set as well as non-pinklestia once ti's released if I can.

<p></p>I have the Mane Six,  The CMC,  Cheerilee and some assorted <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">Canon Foreigner</a> s (Blossomforth,  Rainbow Flash,  Lily Blossom,  Sugarcup/Cupcake,  Lulu Luck and Dewdrop Dazzle and Ploomette)
<p></p>I have 17 more figurines to collects. Not including the Alicorns,  or the Collector Figures coming out later this year.
<p></p>Some figures come in sets though,  considering there is a Celestia and Luna set and I just want Luna (I will be caught dead before I buy a Pink Celestia). Which makes it tough :J

            @Seraph it wasn't just the Celestia stuff,  I just thought the final battle was really weak and lacked ANY tension,  the Season 2 references became real obvious and distracting and the Pegasus Enclave,  which were TERRIBLE villains

            As far as I'm concerned,  the final battle was between Red Eye and Littlepip.  I wasn't hugely interested in the Enclave battle,  I was far more interested in whatever was inside of the SPP.
<p></p>@Pipping:  I'm definitely getting just about all of the figures in the upcoming wave that includes Vinyl,  Zecora,  and Nightmare Moon.

<p></p>I plan on getting all the Collector figures. Apparently,  Trixie and Heartstrings are among them.
<p></p>Of course,  Vinyl Scratch,  NMM,  White!Celestia and Zecora are must haves.
