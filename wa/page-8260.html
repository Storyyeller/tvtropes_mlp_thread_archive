            I think the Spy is the most fun to play,  though it's usually hard to be effective with. Scouts are the fastest,  but medics are almost as fast and heal over time. If there aren't many players,  a medic and just run the flag back and forth with little resistance.

<p></p>If we're short on players I'd tend towards Soldier,  because we won't need as much healing. Medic I'd save for playing more serious matches,  where I'll be consistently needed and useful. Otherwise I'm just standing around like a bum.
<p></p>Although for huge matches soldier is still fun because of the concentration of scrubs. They just run right into the rockets.

You have no easy way to defend yourself,  unless you're a good battle medic,  and you generally have to rely on your teammates to protect you. A medic can grab the intel,  but they won't survive long.

            @Story: Very much so. It's geared much more toward teamwork in a lot of cases,  so except in the case of the scout there isn't really any one class that can hold it's own too much. I mean once you get good with any class you <em>can</em> hold your own,  but it's generally inadvisable. The medic really should be sticking around his team.
<p></p>Although I suppose if there were only a few people on the server you could get away with doing some solo flag capping,  bnut it's still best to have someone to watch your back,  and then you'll want him to have the flag.

            Well admittedly,  I only played TFC with my highschool classmates,  so noone was at pro level either. Though there was one guy who was annoyingly good.
<p></p>Edit: Looks like <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TvTroeps" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TvTroeps">Tv Troeps</a> agrees with me.
<p></p><em>Combat Medic: Far more so than his Team Fortress 2 incarnation. The Medic,  while not able to heal from a distance,  had a shotgun,  a BFG Nailgun far superior to its normal counterpart,  mobility comparable to that of the Scout's (including the ability to conc-jump),  and worst of all,  the ability to hit enemies with an infection attack. It's like being on fire,  except there's higher DPS,  it spreads to your teammates,  and it can never,  ever be put out,  except by an allied Medic. (Or death.) There was even a popular binded message for this: "Infected? Go to Resupply and tell your friends!".</em>

            Yes... that shit don't fly in <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TF2" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TF2">TF 2</a>. The Medic does have some useful combat abilities if you kknow how to use them,  especially with his alt weapons - a specific melee weapon gives you 25% charge on a hit,  and an alt of his primary weapon regains 3 health for every hit - and considering it's a machine gun,  this is not insignificant.
<p></p>However the primary is an arcing weapon making it hard to aim,  and he has one of the lowest health in the game. A skilled player can be a battle medic,  but ONLY a skilled player.

            I assume the Spy is completely different too,  due to the reliance on invisibility (which isn't present at all in TFC).

            It's actually not so much a reliance on the invisibility,  though it can be if you play him clumsily. The invisibility is just a good tool for finding you position. You primarily use your disguises as a spy.

            Even then a skilled combat medic vs any equally skilled other class (sans <em>maybe</em> pyro under the right circumstances) will still lose. Medics simply aren't effective in combat,  regardless of their theoretical damage output.

            You can also no longer do cool tricks like super grenade jumping (hold a grenade until it explodes,  which kills you in most cases,  but lets you get into weird places on certain maps).

            I don't know how the Spy functioned in TFC,  but in <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TF2" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TF2">TF 2</a>,  he relies on getting behind the enemy to take out specific targets. The invisibility is just one method he can use. It mostly just boils down to whichever weapons you use. A Dead Ringer spy can't turn invisible unless he gets shot and it's for a short period. A spy is a bad match in most 1v1s depending on whether or not you can backstab(which isn't helpful if they're at a distance) or aim your Revolver. And a Soldier vs a Spy at midrange is probably not going to end well for the Spy most every time. <br> <br>I wouldn't say that disguising or invisibility is more useful. It's based entirely on the circumstances. If the number of people on the server is large,  a disguise can be more useful if it's hectic. It's also easier to accidentally bump into people if you're invisible. Don't mind me,  Spy's just my favorite class.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">  <br> <br>With tricks,  you'd be surprised what you can do. Pyros can essentially rocket jump and the sticky jumper and rocket jumper allow you to rocket jump without taking damage.

            But there's very little you can actually do in cloak rather than just stalk. It's good for getting into position,  but the disguise is necessary to actually get anything done.

            Even if you're disguised,  though,  you do <em>not</em> want to be seen. Disguise or no,  you <em>will</em> be shot at or otherwise spychecked. Just because you have to uncloak to stab doesn't mean that you shouldn't be spending the majority of your time invisible anyway.

            not <em>really</em>. Each class has a dominant playstyle,  and finding those are fairly simple. From there it's just a matter of refining. The spy is the only one that requires strategy.
