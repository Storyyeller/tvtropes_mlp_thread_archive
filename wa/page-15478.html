            What I do is,  a circles and line layer in grey,  then an outline layer in black over it.  But...my lack of confidence on the lines make it come out scratchy.  I don't know if I should embrace it or stamp it out.

            For things like pony legs,  just a quick,  long stroke is fine. You just have to use the eraser to clean up areas where lines meet.

            RE: Rarity martial art
<p></p>I wouldn't be surprised. I find it interesting that she seems to practice a hard,  striking martial arts. Considering how she wouldn't like her feature getting roughed up,  I think it would make more sense if she took up a more soft martial arts.
<p></p>Soft and Hard martial arts:
<p></p>Hard - You strike with your own strength. This describes most striking based martial arts,  like boxing.
<p></p>Soft - You redirect your opponent's strength against him. Primary example is aikido and Jeet Kun Do (martial art created by <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BruceLee" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BruceLee">Bruce Lee</a>),  although the latter also fits Hard category.
<p></p>/martial arts over.
<p></p><hr>
<p></p>RE: Drawing - I can never try anything other than small sketches with my pencil and occasionally pen. I'm too lazy to give it enough practices. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            @d Roy: Well,  some soft martial arts still bulk you up a lot. Judo,  fopr example,  is based primarily on leverage and using your opponants weight,  but until you get really good at it it still requires a <em>lot</em> of strength.
<p></p>What she may have done is take Tai Chi,  in which the movements are primarily designed for fitness,  balance,  etc. over actual combat,  but which <em>can</em> be sped up for the sake of fighting.

<p></p>Also,  drawing is one of those things that I'd like to learn,  but it would require too much of a time investment on my part.  Especially since I'd want to get a tablet or something and I just don't have the money to spend on something like that that I probably wouldn't use much anyway.

<p></p>My biggest problem with the drawing is what Putinforgood said; her hips are way too small compared to her legs. Legs should not be thicker than bust in normal circumstances.
<p></p>@kegisak - Not really. You only need to bulk up when you are going for a higher weight class. Most of my buddies in wrestling and judo clubs are often struggling with cutting weight.
<p></p>Also,  aikido is rather similar in Tai Chi,  although more combat oriented.
<p></p>Besides,  absolutely ALL martial arts can be used for primarily fitness purposes,  so there really isn't any point of saying that one should take X for fitness purpose. Fitness boxing is pretty popular where I live.

            @Apple,  regarding AJ: Something to look into might be the difference between Soft Muscle and Hard Muscle. More defined muscles,  regardless of size,  are actually weaker than less-defined muscles of the same size. Muscles that look like they've got a bit of fat around are able to do more work.
<p></p>Think of the guy in a Worlds Strongest Man competition,  if you've ever seen one. They're a lot closer to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength">Stout Strength</a> than Bodybuilder - some of them even look outright fat. I imagine AJ would be similar,  not really have very defined muscle but looking more... generally big around.

<p></p>I might be getting fetishy but,  do you think AJ could be mildly stout strength?
<p></p>Big muscles hidden under a layer of fat (because she likes to eat)?

            Yeah,  height and mass.
<p></p>Still,  given some of the stuff we had to do in exercise drills,  I feel as though strength,  if only leg strength,  is still decently important. We used to do things like running around the dojo with a person on our shoulders,  etc. I suppose it helps with having a strong base and good balance.

<p></p>Just bear in mind she'd have to be an enormous <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a> or predisposed to a degree of fat to keep it on,  considering all the work she does. But then,  being predisposed to a certain amount of fat might lead to some natural strength. Or,  again,  that may be just me. I'm kind of a mutant,  I realize.

            @AL - Actually,  that doesn't sound too bad. Many strong farmers tend to be stocky and strong. I don't think she would have that much "layer of fat" though; I don't think her calories intake is that high,  although what we saw in AFR might disagree.
<p></p>@kegisak - Really? That's certainly a fascinating training method. I never did that sort of thing in either of my grappling club,  though. I didn't work a whole lot on leg strength,  but what we did work on,  and gruelingly often,  was drilling the basic form and footwork until quarter of my feet is covered with callus.
<p></p>I think when I go back to the club (I'm outside US,  so no can do),  I might suggest what you practice. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            It wasn't a regular occurrence. Generally the method was,  Start with basic warmups and a few drills,  usually practising falls and entries(That is,  moving in for a throw without actually doing the throw). Then we learned a new throw,  and sparred for about a half hour,  switching partners every five minutes. Then we learned a ground hold,  and did ground sparring for a half hour or so,  switching every five minutes. Then a cooldown to end it off. Basically,  most of training was sparring,  which is why we tended to do well in tournaments over clubs that only did drills. There was also the fact that we raised belt levels "When we had earned it" rather than having a standardized test.
<p></p>Every so often though we would have entire days dedicated to fitness training,  when we would do stuff like that. It was usually pretty brutal too,  squats and running with people on your back. One day we had to do verticle pushups with someone holding our ankles for support. There was one for agility too,  where two people sprinted at each other and when they met one had to drop into a guard position and the other leap over them.
