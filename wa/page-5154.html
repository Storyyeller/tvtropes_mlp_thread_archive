            L Mage: Yeah. She's a hard worker when it comes to magic. It's her cutie mark. That's what people with cutie marks do. And that's another flaw,  if you want to think about it,  too withdrawn and reliant on books. I believe that was the character trait that kicked off the entire story. So if anything,  it shows her has a more developed character than anything. If her cutie mark was collecting coins,  you can bet your ass she would be in that library researching every coin in the world. That's not a reliance on magic. That's Twilight Sparkle.

<p></p>Still,  it's a good lesson to learn for Twilight. All you've done is expand on <em>other</em> parts of her character not refute the position that she is over-reliant on magic and needs to learn her identity is not dependent on it,  and neither is her friend's opinion of her.

            But why is it a good lesson for Twilight specifically? She's had PLENTY of things to challenge her preconceived notions. If anything,  someone like Pinkie Pie or Fluttershy or RD might be better off learning that.
