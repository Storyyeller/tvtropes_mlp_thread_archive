            I think The Palace is in chapter 4,  yeah. Apart from Forest,  that chapter seems to base everything on the theme of fortresses - "Castle, " "The Palace, " "Babylon, " and "Tower." I've played every level in the original except "Forest" and "Hell."
<p></p>Not sure what my favorite weapon is. I use them all fairly equally,  but I am very fond of the shotgun (I always love shotguns in shooters) and,  of course,  the Electrodriver.
<p></p>Oh,  I loved the defective turrets so much.

            @ginger: As would I,  but it's not necessarily economic to pander to the more intelligent,  especially not in a larger scale game.
<p></p>There <em>are</em> ways to get around it,  though. Changing up attack patterns,  timing,  combining attacks... as little as three varieties of attack can lead to a good battle if used correctly. And a Boss can often be engaging for reaosns other than what it does to <em>you</em>. You're looking at this solely from an attacks perspective,  but that isn't even all that there is to <em>gameplay</em>,  let alone the actual battle. what if one of those attacks reuired you to do something very challenging and intesne,  like ducking into a piece of cover pretty far away while dodging between some stuff? It's simple enough to be doable but challenging enough to be consistently challenging. What an attack makes you <em>do</em> is more important than the attack itself.
<p></p>Similarly,  there' much more to a boss fight than the simple gameplay. there's the background,  the level,  both in how you interact with it and how you don't. A boss can have relatively <em>simple</em> attack that still look interesting if they're flashy enough.
<p></p>A game's 'job' is to keep you engaged and give you an experience. If you're <em>only</em> focusing on one element of it it's impossible for it to do it's job,  because you're stripping it of all the necessary materials to do so. It's like watching a movie,  but stripping away everything bu the lines and actors. It's just people talking to one another in an empty room. I can say a script was poor but still enjoy the movie quite a bit for what it <em>does</em> with that poor script,  because it gives me a great experience.

            Again,  I just can't agree with that.
<p></p>Whenever I'm fighting a boss I always end up going IS THAT IT?! at some point. It pisses me off.

            I'm afraid not.
<p></p>Although I have had battles where I stop and think,  "Is that all?",  but it's not for lack of <em>attacks</em>,  but for lack of challenge or creativity <em>with</em> the attacks. Or just the battle didn't have a good experience in general.
<p></p>But I'm curious what you're getting at with Colours,  here.

I'm just barely out of college; I can talk the talk but I doubt I can do much walking just yet. Need experience first.

            In a lot of games,  especially shooters,  "boss" battles largely seem to amount to "this one guy that has more health than everyone else."
<p></p>Or worse... cutscene boss battles.

            and for the record I'm not trying to sound like I know what you like,  I'm just going based on what you've given me. You told me that you like boss battles only when they have lots of attacks,  and I proposed why that's not generally feasible and why if that's all you're looking at you might try to broaden you view a little bit. I expected that there was more to it,  in fact,  but that was what you gave me to work with.
<p></p>Besides,  I was using 'you' in more general terms than you specifically.

            I've heard about how some folks have wondered where the humans are in <em>MLP: FIM</em>.
<p></p>That is an interesting question. In the first generation of <em>MLP</em>,  they had established that the human world and the pony world were separate worlds that could only be crossed by rainbows. Then it looks like human characters were dropped entirely from the franchise after the first generation.
<p></p>Still,  I have noticed that Equestria has pony equivalents to Manhattan and Philadelphia. Maybe Equestria is a separate world from the human Earth. I don't know,  and I get the feeling that <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaurenFaust" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaurenFaust">Lauren Faust</a> will never tell!

            Eggman at the end of Colours got on my nerves because for the most part I really enjoyed it,  but I just felt like he should've had more attacks
<p></p>This might have been more of a story related thing though,  since Eggman starts using dark versions of your powerups while you try to amass all the powerups again yourself
<p></p>Problem? He doesn't use dark versions of ALL of your powerups. Only about 4 or 5 of them

            This is admittedly an oversight on the designers part... actually,  not necessarily.
<p></p>In fact,  it's likely more an example of how I said that having lots of attacks isn't feasible. what likely happened is they had attacks planned for <em>all</em> of them,  but they could only <em>build</em> 4 or 5 due to time constraints.
<p></p>But in a situation like this what you're ultimately telling me isn't that you want more attack,  but that you want more <em>variety</em>. The boss felt stagnant compared to what it could have been. So,  if he had used the attacks differently,  or in different combinations,  it likely would have felt better.
<p></p>Of course in this case you have the issue that story and gameplay aren't syncing up,  which leads to my point about how holistic these fights are - you expected him to have more because of the <em>story</em>. If you had been dropped right into it,  it likely wouldn't have been as big a deal.

            umm Kegi,  no you do not understand the epic FAIL that was Madness of Deathwing,  it is stupid on every level,  there is NOTHING in that fight that anyone can see that makes it reasonable to think it's a end boss of a game. you literally repeat the exact same sequence of attacks 4 time over ~ 10 mins,  just losing one added buff each time,  and the majority of that "fighting" is everyone stadning still hitting the same giant pillar,  with one pack of "adds" that get AOE'D down in like 15 secs. Then the very final part,  the final battle against the biggest boss in the game,  the thing they had been building up to for over a year.....you stand there and whack on his wall swized head while he lies there doing nothing but summoning the occasional add or two that you burn down to quick to notice.
<p></p>FAIL!!!!!!
