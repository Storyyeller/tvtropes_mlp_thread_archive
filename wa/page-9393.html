            I'm kinda tempted to recommend <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leverage" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leverage">Leverage</a>,  but I'm not sure how much the heroes' smugness might grate on you.  They typically get messed up during the episode,  but they almost always end up winning in the end.
<p></p>Also,  I'm kinda curious about how a movie would work out.  Not due to the quality (I'm pretty sure it would be good; most of the epic episodes' main problem was that they were rushed and a movie probably wouldn't be),  but because the anti-brony media will have a field day when dozens of dudes show up at the theaters.

            @chad: Well,  before I got the game I actually did some reading into tarot symbolism,  and kinda came up with the mane six's arcana,  though ther'es a few that are more solid than others.
<p></p>Solid:
<p></p>Twilight: Hermet. the hermit arcana represents solitude,  retreat and the pursuit of wisdom and introspection. Twilight is pretty much the epitome of solitude,  burying herself in the quest for understanding. While she hasn't reached the wisdom criteria YET,  it's clear that bettering herself and understanding is priority 1.
<p></p>Fluttershy: Lovers. while most people reasonably assume the lovers represents romantic love,  in actuality it represents duality. It's the choices we make in life and where they might lead,  and opposites coming together. Fluttershy's personality is obviously very dualistic,  but it's also worth note that much of her personality seems to be a choice. She has very clear things that she shunts away,  meaning she <em>chooses</em> to be good and to put away her anger.
<p></p>AJ: Strength. the strength arcana doesn't represent physical strenght,  but rather strength of the self. It represents discipline and tempering oneself. AJ has very clear morals and values,  and has distinct rules for what she <em>must</em> be or do. She clearly defines the use of her own strength.
<p></p>RD: Chariot. the chariot represents agressiveness and conquest. It's also symbolic of moving forward,  striving to acheive our goals no matter what. In spite of her lethargy Dash is <em>always</em> working hard to achieve her goals,  and is undeniably agressive.
<p></p>Less solid:
<p></p>Rarity: Star. The star is the symbol of hope and self-confidence,  but it also represents generosity and altruism. It's less solid than the others because it represents peace and joy as well,  while Rarity is still clearly at war with some aspects of herself. She is,  however,  undeniably self-confident and literally embodies generosity.
<p></p>Pinkie: The fool. the fool is representative of many,  many things. In fact,  in many interpretations the fool represents limitless possibility. More solid readings however mark it as the symbol of creativity,  madness,  spontenaeity,  and most noteably of beginnings. Pinkie undeniably marks most of those,  but I;'m admittedly reluctant ot mark her something representing limitless possibilities. Another possible arcana is the sun,  which represents optimism,  joy and energy.

<p></p>I haven't seen all the episodes. I think I watched maybe 10-15 or so. Anyway,  there aren't many villians,  and there is a little romance.

            @blue: I... tried watching brotherhood,  and didn't get very far. I might give it another shot,  but...
<p></p>What I look for in a work are the characters. I love to watch mental arcs,  see characters play against one another,  just see how they act and react. What I didn't like about Brotherhood is how quickly it jumped into the plot,  without giving us time to get to know Ed or Al. I just didn't have much cause to care about them.
<p></p>My favourite anime was easily <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KinosJourney" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KinosJourney">Kino's Journey</a>,  because it was <em>all</em> character. I loved the somber tone of it,  and how everything was about Kino's experiences and how she felt about it all.

            Kino's Journey was fantastic.  I was less thrilled with <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllisonAndLillia" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllisonAndLillia">Allison and Lillia</a>.

But yeah,  I actually realised my mistake after posting.  It is a fairly compelling conspiracy story overall though,  and a decent adventure series with not a lot of physical conflict.  In many ways,  it is reminiscent of the old Incredible Hulk tv series.

<p></p>@Kegisak: I'd recommend you read the manga of FMA anyway; it's the best paced.

<p></p><span class="blue">@Kegisak: Yeah,  I can totally see that.  The problem with Brotherhood,  for those people who didn't watch the earlier series,  is that it wants to hurry up and get past all the episodes that were already covered by the previous show.  So it moves <em>very</em> fast at the beginning.  After about 10-14 episodes,  it finishes covering all of that,  and slows down to a much,  much more reflective,  thoughtful pacing.  Unfortunately it has a tendency of failing to hold newcomers interests that far.  It didn't bother me because I had already watched the prior show <em>and</em> read a good deal of the comic,  so I was in a hurry to get to the new developments myself.  But I can understand why it would annoy you.  For what it's worth,  it does focus very heavily on the characters,  their mental states,  their development,  and such things once it slows down.</span>

            Well,  to catch him them employ a similarly trained/raised/programmed individual and there are several times their plans to catch him work,  it's just the personal connections agendas some of the characters have that usually allow him to escape.  Besides,  while the organization they work for is evil,  the people tracking him develop into sympathetic characters.
<p></p>@Blue:  Nah,  it's cool,  I recognised that the chances of Ginger actually being interested in the show after I typed up the synopsis were slim.  I had forgotten to take his needs/likes into account fully.
