With regards to the sun and the moon,  the current comic arc seems to throw real-life cosmology out the window,  at least with regards to the Moon,  though we don't know the exact details just yet.</div>
<p></p>Interesting. What <em>do</em> we know so far?

I think you'd have to be a mad man to believe that Celestia is moving the Sun as in heliocentric model. </div>
<p></p>If the sun is moving <em>at all</em> it is <em>by definition</em> not a heliocentric model. It's geocentric,  but I ee no indictions that the sun isn't the same size and distance as our own.

            @Sereg: If she really was engaging in criminal negligence when they came up with their plan I might agree,  but they didn't. They came up with it before. The way the events are framed it makes it seem like they are doing it less out of concern fro the town and RD's behavior and more out of spite. In that way I see their tenure as MDW as contributing to Dash's negligence more then mitigating it (in the sense that she became more concerned with her reputation after she got a rival).

            @Sereg People have a problem with it because there's alot of <em>inferred</em> strength being thrown around as fact,  rather than <em>demonstrated</em> strength. Goku and Superman have been <em>shown</em> to be able to destroy planets. Celestia has been shown to be able to move the sun,  but she hasn't been shown to be able to do much else. Just as her being able to crush the solar system could be within her power,  it is <em>equally possible</em> that her extraordinary abilities extend to control over the sun,  with everything else being skills acquired over the centuries,  and all of that energy she's capable of harnessing to move the sun can't actually be used for anything else. Both interpretations are equally valid,  so if people have a problem with yours,  it's just because they see their own as more plausible in their own mind.

            @Mio: I disagree ith that interpretation,  but anyway.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">@Sereg: Both of those examples have canonical explanations; Superman and Goku explicitly have super strength. </div>
<p></p>A: <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> isn't enough to explain it.
<p></p>B: So do ponies (at the very least,  earth ponies).
<p></p>C: So,  for example,  pulling a house doesn't count as a demonstration of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> unless we're <em>told</em> they have <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>?

<p></p>Sure,  it's <em>possible</em> that the Sun is on  railway track and all Celestia does is turn the engine on and off and so it's not <em>her</em> power but the engines for example. My point is that their is no evidence of that andunless things are <em>incredibly</em> weird in a way that the show hasn't even <em>begun</em> to hint at,  her simply being that powerful is the simplest explanation.

If there had been a scene with them sitting Dash down and explaining that she'd hurt someone if she kept the showboating up,  and then resorted to the MMDW thing when it didn't work,  it would have been more palatable. It also doesn't help that they included that scene where they all pat themselves on the back by talking about how the MMDW is so awesome,  talking only about their own contributions. </div>

<p></p>There's also no evidence that it <em>is</em>,  which is the crux of the argument. Given all the other massive departures from real world science,  I find it <em>far</em> more likely that the sun isn't really that much like our own.
<p></p>Also what Perpetual said.
<p></p>@Sereg: 1. Nobody is talking about earth ponies; whether or not they have super strength is irrelevant to talking about the cosmology
<p></p>2. We <em>just</em> established that the exact circumstances surrounding the super strength is questionable anyway
<p></p>3. The point is what Perpetual said. We're willing to accept that Superman and Goku have super strength because it's repeatedly shown that they do.  With Celestia it's entirely different,  because there's no evidence that she's uberpowerful other than the fact that she can move the sun,  and there are other explanations for how she can do that besides "she has absurd magic abilities".  It's entirely possible that that is indeed the case,  but it's far from the only plausible explanation.

<p></p>It's <em>exactly</em> what you're doing. Physics says they can't do those things,  so their universes must run on,  as you call it,  "bullshit physics" and therefore their abilities must be discounted. All fiction must be treated equally or you start going,  "I shot you!",  "Nuh uh!"
<p></p>@JT: I was speaking in general there rather than cosmologiclly,  but whatevs. The edit still applies.

            @Sereg: It is relevant when you're comparing a d20/pathfinder character to one from GURPS or Exalted or something. Or a Ogre Battle Tactics hero to someone from FF Tactics (War of the Lions) and to someone from FF Tactics A2 (Grimoire of the Rift).
