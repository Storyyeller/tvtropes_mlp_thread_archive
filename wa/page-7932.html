            A bit of my own fanon is that Ponies naturally associate being an alicorn with being super-equine,  especially if they are stronger-than-normal. This extends into their culture and collective conciousness,  so their armor and some of their fashions will reflect this by also offering options for costume horns/wings to be added on.
<p></p>It also extends to my idea of a pony!<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Iji" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Iji">Iji</a>,  who would have artificial wings of glowing nano and a Nanogun "horn" fused to her forehead,  with glowing lines of nano and strength-amplifiers running down her face to give her the strength necessary to hold her head up while carrying the high-mass nanogun stuck to her head.

            @Ginger: Have you been taking your medicine?
<p></p>@Cookoo: I suppose they would look vaguely pony-like,  Tasen would be slimmer and Komato would be a tad hulkier with manelike serrated-fins.
<p></p>@Orion: You don't? Well I suppose it might tie into my idea of balance,  that normal ponies only have a certain amount of magic inherent to them so if they had all three forms of Pony magic it would be diluted and less powerful. Also I guess that super-equine ponies would not necessarily be alicorns,  you might get an Earth Pony with 300% power who has ridiculous strength and the power to do some things better than any ordinary pony.

            @Ace: We do like our alicorns,  seeing as how they have the benefit of having both magic and flight,  but to make outfits to emulate their physiology? I have yet to encounter this. Maybe I should ask Rarity about this.

            Anyways my idea was that pony!<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Iji" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Iji">Iji</a> would be an Earth Pony by nature,  only her cybernatic modifications turned her into a synthetic alicorn,  and she still doesn't get the racial magics because she's still basically an Earth pony and her modifications are mainly for looks and !science. She can't fly because her nanowings are too small to give lift and she lacks Pegasus racial magic,  but she can now jump much higher than any unaugmented pony,  for one,  and since her "horn" is actually a nanogun she lacks Unicorn racial magic and cannot do telekinesis.
<p></p>...Somehow I can picture Star Swirl trying to make an artificial horn she could wear to get the benefits of Unicorn racial magic. Thing is I doubt Pony racial magic works that way.
