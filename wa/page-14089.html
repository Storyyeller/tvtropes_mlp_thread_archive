            Had a G3 MLP dream that had elements of G4 MLP in it. The Ponies fought Nightmare Moon,  who looked like her G4 self and could be either a Pegasus or a Unicorn but not both at once. There was also Discord,  who looked like a male Nightmare Moon with a buzz haircut and glowing green/purple eyes. He used shadows as weapons.
<p></p>I’m not sure what happened to Nightmare Moon or if she was any corrupted pony,  but they combined the elements to blast Discord with a super rainbow and he reformed. He even wore one of Minty’s sock hats.
<p></p>The Elements were slightly different too,  I think inspired by G3 Spike’s list of castles that celebrate things—music,  kindness,  laughter,  families,  friendship,  and rainbows. He,  Kimono,  and G3 Cheerilee—the unicorn—teamed up to give advice as well. I think the fight spilled from Butterfly Island to Ponyville,  and they finished it in Unicornia.
<p></p>Element Bearers:
<p></p>Fun: G3 Rarity
Kindness: Wysteria
Generosity: Star Catcher
Rainbows: G3 Rainbow Dash
Loyalty: Minty
Friendship: G3 Pinkie Pie

They're both too... stable,  I guess. They don't clash much,  personality-wise. Although itd be kinda funny to see them jointly go overboard on something.
<p></p>In other news,  just read issue 5 of the MLP comic. This new arc is looking pretty good so far! Also,  I kinda hope the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorMoon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorMoon">Selena</a> pony from the background shows up again. Just because it'd be appropriate,  because I haven't seen Sailor Moon since I was a kid.

            @Kegisak: They wouldn't necessarily have to butt heads.  In fact,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ADelicateBalance" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ADelicateBalance">for my purposes it would be better if they didn't.</a>

I guess the best source for a clash is their slightly differing virtues. While AJ often shows an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a> method and will consider borderline killing herself than letting a friend down,  Twilight is more logical and sometimes has a colder 'tough love' approach. I suppose an intense situation could lead AJ to find Twilight heartless or the latter to think AJ is an imbecile.
<p></p>Alternatively AJ is <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette">The Lad-ette</a> and messy compared to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperOCD" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperOCD">Super OCD</a> Twilight. I'm surprised she didn't crack as much as Rarity over some of the stuff she did in her house in Look Before You Sleep.
<p></p>RD vs Twilight would likely be a similar 'Curmudgeonly Workaholic vs Mischevious Layabout' dynamic as against AJ,  only befitted to Twilight's less aggressive but more overintricate and 'nerdy' approach. For some reason I see the two clashing in a similar manner as Sonic and Sally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonicSatAm" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonicSatAm">Sonic Sat Am</a></em> albeit maybe with Twilight acting as flawed an extreme as RD rather than a clear <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a>.

            OK,  that sounds like an awesome battle. G4 Pinkie and Minty would be quite the pair of insanity. It's a toss up as to who should get rainbow,  G3 Rainbow Dash or G3 Rarity,  or both.

            The most effective way to create a conflict between two characters is to pit their strongest qualities and flaws against each other — and bonus points when they match!  The strongest qualities of Twi and AJ is that they're both generally sane and reasonable,  albeit from opposite standpoints (intellectual vs. straightforward).  Their greatest flaws are that Twilight is sometimes obliviously tactless and Applejack can be goaded into a temper — both of which can lead into an accidental vindictive streak.
<p></p>So put them both up against an external problem,  but give them each only half the solution...then watch them obstruct each other.  Twilight's perfectionism causes her to become hostile,  which touches off Applejack's pride and sets her into stubborn bullheaded mode.  Twilight goes all Magical Lone Wolf to do it herself and fails,  while Applejack pulls the town together into a group effort that degrades into a misaimed riot.

I love stuff where both parties are doing what they think is best but are screwing each other over.  What kind of conflict would merit that sort of argument though?  Maybe some sort of Winter Wrap Up Equivalent,  where Twilight thinks crafting a single uberspell is best because it means nopony else has to be inconvenienced,  while AJ thinks it would be faster and easier to bring in as many ponies as possible to solve the problem.

            Something that both of them have some degree of expertise in,  but could miss how it overlaps with the other.  My first thought would be a magical crop blight that reacts violently to both of their solutions.
<p></p>Also,  I might be subconsciously pulling from Contraptionology,  where the critical subplot between them is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">leadership jealousy</span>.

            That sounds impressively accurate for how a good Twilight vs AJ episode could work. They are responsible character but from two very different methods that don't always clash well. Not to mention they can be easily riled up under the right situation,  Twilight can be stuck up and neuroses prone while AJ is sometimes a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> just waiting to be pressed.

            I like the idea of an Applejack vs. Fluttershy episode where Applejack's methods of corralling critters and her being used to more organized farming come in conflict with Fluttershy's more laidback approach to the animals she tends to.  This was hinted at in Applebuck Season where Applejack accidentally made the rabbits panic because she aggressively herded them like cattle but it could be used again.  This was also hinted at in Keep Calm and Flutter On where Applejack needed Fluttershy's help with dealing with the beavers,  who were annoyed partially because Applejack just insulted them and didn't try to look at things from the beavers' point of view.  Basically,  Applejack is used to making animals do things for the sake of the farm,  while Fluttershy is used to doing things that the animals need even if it causes problems for her.
<p></p>Perhaps there could be some kind of middle ground between the two as well,  like reminding Fluttershy that caring for someone doesn't mean giving in to their every whim (or reminding her of the times she's needed to be tough like when she uses the Stare or of her assertiveness lessons).
<p></p>As for what I would like to see in season 4,  I would probably like it if they mixed together characters who haven't interacted much so far,  both within the main six and with other ponies.  It would be funny to have Big Macintosh interact with Pinkie,  they unfortunately didn't get to show that in Magical Mystery Cure and maybe they could have some reason for Pinkie to have to team up with him for some project.  Or he could be paired with Rainbow Dash.  They both have some kind of extreme athletic talent (Rainbow Dash is super fast and Big Mac is super strong) but they have very different personalities since Big Macintosh is so quiet and doesn't seem like the type to brag about his strength the way Rainbow Dash brags about being fast.
<p></p>And of course how Rarity deals with Twilight being a princess now,  given Rarity loves anything related to royalty.
<p></p>I would also like to see some of the Equestrian holidays be celebrated again.

            I honestly find it very unlikely that any of the others would easily come into conflict with Twilight now. I think with her being a Princess and all that they would be more likely to defer to her decisions. Might actually be an upcoming episode dealing with that sort of thing.
