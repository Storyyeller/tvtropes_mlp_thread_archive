            I wouldn't mind seeing more like this. They can't be perfect all of the time,  but what's more interesting is that they can overcome the mitigating circumstances and be generous/kind/honest etc. In fact that would also solve the problem with AJ. When you have a character who doesn't have a flaw that needs to be fixed,  have them face extenuating challenge. Or something.

            The thing that gets me most is that Rarity didn't catch on to what Sweetie Bell was trying to do.  She's always caught onto things like that before,  and Sweetie Bell wasn't exactly being subtle.

<p></p>Except for the her drawing. Rarity was just shocked that Sweetey had smudged her gems with glue all over to pay attention to the drawing.
<p></p>I mean,  how well does glue wash off from gems? A completely clear surface where even the tiniest smudge is visible.

            I'd like to think that despite Rarity being usually generous I don't think she always realizes what a pony might need or want. So while she might be more than willing to give of herself,  it will probably be what "she" thinks you need,  and not necessarily what you actually need or want.
<p></p>I also want to point out that throughout most of the series the Elements are not really referenced,  at all. In fact I would have dismissed them and logged them under <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a> if they weren't brought up again in Return of Harmony.

Her main problem isn't that she isn't willing to give,  it's that she doesn't know <em>what</em> to give,  so she offers what she would want if she was in that position.

<p></p>Couldn't have put it better myself.
<p></p>But you know how the fandom and fanon is...
<p></p>But yeah,  despite being the <em>bearers</em> of the elements doesn't mean they need to <em>embody</em> them 24/7. Hell,  Discord even referred to them being the ponies <em>strenghts</em>. So they're good at it when they decide to act like so.
<p></p>Though the pilot episodes made the whole "Honesty" bit really badly. That seemed more like a <em>trust</em> moment than <em>honesty</em>.

Well,  the upcoming DVD <em>might</em> be different from the other three,  since it's by a different company (<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutFactory" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutFactory">Shout! Factory</a>/Vivendi Visual).

            Rarity's frustration and irritation made sense to me because well,  sometimes you can have a real blind spot when it comes to interacting with siblings and family. Being generous towards the likes of the rest of Mane Six is probably easier sometimes given that they're peers.

<p></p>I hope that isn't the case.  Having sequential volumes of episodes in order is almost as good as having a season set.

            Maybe there's trouble with an uncertain market or something. Maybe they don't know much about the fandom? Who knows. It's different with toys because the parents would buy them for little girls regardless.

            Well,  I know that <em>we're</em> sticklers for keeping stuff in order,  but that's not necessarily the case with the show people.  Other than the pilots having to go at the starts of their seasons,  we know that they try to keep continuity to a minimum,  so they might not care too much about keeping them in order.  No idea if that's actually the case,  but it's possible.

            I was scrolling through the backround pony page,  and 2 things occured to me; 1) I REALLY need to read some fanfics about Octavia and/or DJ
<p></p>2) I was looking at <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DJPon3" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DJPon3">DJ Pon 3</a> and it hit me that she kinda looks like Rarity with a different mane on.......and that's when it hit me; wouldn't it be hilarious if it turned out Rarity and the DJ were really sisters?<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16"> That was just me being silly,  of course,  but then I started thinking about the fan reaction......think about it. If it turned out that Rarity and the DJ were siblings,  how do you predict the fans would react? Let's say they reveal it casually,  like Sweetie saying 'Hey guys,  I'm going to see my sister' (scootaloo or something): 'Rarity?' 'No,  my OTHER sister,  Vinyl.'
