            Ah,  Cupcakes.... I remember reading the first part of it thinking it wasn't so bad. I later found out that there was more. I avoided reading until it was reposted on ED. My curiosity got the better of me and so I decided to read it.
<p></p>After all how bad could it be? I was sure everyone was just exaggerating. That was a mistake.
<p></p>I got halfway through it before I realized that I shouldn't have fucking read it. But there was no turning back. I skimmed the rest,  but it was still terrible.
<p></p>I'm not joking when I say it made me feel physically ill. That abomination stayed in my head for the rest of the day,  even while I was at work. UGH.
<p></p>Fuck Sargent Sprinkles for writing that shit. Fuck me for reading it. Fuck everything.
<p></p>......Funnily enough,  his non-grimdark fics are some of my favorites. Go figure.

            I guess I'm desensitized to this sort of thing? I read it and I was like "Oh,  god. Damn,  this is kinda nasty. Let's keep reading."

            See that's the thing,  I thought I was desensitized to that kind of thing,  too. I'm not effected by violence in games and I can even stomach horror movies,  even though I still don't like them. Actually,  it wasn't the gore bothered me the most.
<p></p>No. It was the mental image of Pinkie Pie being an insane cannibalistic serial killer.
<p></p>That fucked with me. Of all the shit she pulled,  there three things that bothered me the most.
<p></p>1.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Her excitement at the thought of mutilating her friends and the implication that she had done so to <em>children</em>.</span>
<p></p>2.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Breaking Dash's spirit by showing her Gilda's skull and telling her broke her and killed her.</span>
<p></p>3. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Taking a bite of some of Dash's flesh in front of her,  and shoving some of it into her mouth.</span>
<p></p>I just...damn.  I'm still a sensitive guy,  even after all the years I've spent surfing the internet.

            I've got this morbid sort of curiosity about cupcakes,  but I'm a tad scared of reading it,  just from how infamous it is.

<p></p>I'm not really adverse to clopfics,  for the most part - being new to the world of fanfiction,  I see little difference between them and shipfics. So long as they're done tastefully,  That is,  and not written like some trashy harlequin romance bollocks,  or whatever they're called. I've read one or two that were really well done.
<p></p>@Pannic: I feel your pain about the fanfiction,  bro. I've been hardpressed to get a word back on one I've been working on too. Why not throw me a link,  and I'll give it a look?

            I've always had this idea of making an unofficial sequel to"Rocket to Insanity" where the events of that story were treated like some bad premonition of Derpy Hooves,  who goes on to kill Mayor Mare. That story is followed up by the events of that story being a bad dream Mayor Mare had,  who then goes out to kill Princess Celestia. her plan is foiled when it turns out that story was just a bad dream of Princess Luna. the dream shakes her so badly that she refuses to put the moon up,  leaving it daylight forever in Equestria. This unleashes the horror known simply as Daymare who goes out to drive Pinkie Pie to insanity,  so she kills Rainbow Dash. this then turns out to be a nightmare of Scootaloo who starts panicking but all is fine when it turns out Pinkie Pie was just making cupcakes from humans.

            So I've been watching this on Youtube.
<p></p>One of my favorite things are the comments that parody the letters.
<p></p>Like: "Dear Princess Celestia. Today I learned fuck griffins."

        <div class="post-content">
            @Pannic: Well,  on the whole I quite liked it. Ritarando is a pretty interesting Character,  and I'm pretty curious about how mysterious you've made him - Very much looking forward to reading more. That said...well,  you asked for critique,  so critique you get!
<p></p>The first thing that really jumps out at me is the formatting of the thing - that is to say,  the choice to have every thing distinct in a separate body of text,  like how this and my compliments above are separate. Now,  I realize it doesn't really matter,  as it won't be published professionally,  but it just looks odd to me. That,  and some of the bodies are awfully short,  especially during the conversation. If you're treating the breaks like new paragraphs,  I'd suggest  extending them by giving a bit of exposition,  talking about what the characters are doing and the like. This gives you an opportunity to move the characters around in the environment,  and set up for something. That way,  the piece flows well,  ass opposed to one character doing something,  then another doing something else,  and so on,  which feels...jerky,  I suppose is the best way of putting it. There's one line in particular that jumped out at me,  at that - "The thunder crashed again". It can work as an independent line,  if it's being used for something dramatic,  but that doesn't seem to be the case here,  so I'd suggest mincing it in with another line of exposition.
<p></p>On that note,  and the note of characterization,  when Gold Standard is introduced,  her dialogue doesn't quite match with her dialogue throughout the rest of the chapter. Her first line sounds somewhat disjointed and broken - not like broken english,  but like someone speaking in shorthand,  as opposed to voicing their entire though,  similar to Mordin from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassEffect" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a>,  if you're familiar with the character. Given that she immediately starts speaking normally afterwards,  I'd assume it was because she was focusing on something else,  but I figured I'd point out that it isn't quite clear.
<p></p>One final note is the use of interrupts. They are a few instances where you add an idle detail with brackets,  mostly confined to the beginning of the story. If it's meant to be a stylistic choice,  as though we're being told this by a narrator who occasionally stops to clarify himself,  then that's okay,  but it should be fairly consistent. As it is,  it just feels like it interrupts the rhythm of the story,  and a few of the interrupts aren't terribly pertinent to the story,  or could be eased in (For example,  changing "Gold Standard (or “Goldie, ” as some friends called her)" to something like,  "Gold standard,  whose friends knew her as Goldie",  or even simply replacing the brackets with commas,  which feels much smoother). Of course,  that's mainly a stylistic choice on my part,  but on the note of details there is one line that needn't exist,  which comes at the end of the description of Raincloud: "But we’ll actually meet her later". <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail">The Law of Conservation of Detail</a> isn't wholly <em>necessary</em> in writing,  given that it can go on for as long as you like,  so you don't have to compress the story at all,  readers are still very much aware of it - which is why you don't ever see books with involved side-plots that never go anywhere. Not even in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twilight" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twilight">Twilight</a>,  much as it seems like it at times. Ehm,  I seem to have [[Metaphorgotten lost my point...]]Basically what I mean to say is that we've just read a paragraph dedicated to Raincloud,  so the reader is going to assume she shows up,  so you don't need to tell them. Likewise,  Constable Brownie and Gold Standard are both assumed to be important,  wheras the shoplifter and the jerky Pegasus are not,  as they are never named.
<p></p>whoo...Hope that wasn't too harsh on you,  I've gotten so used to ripping into stuff in college...like I said,  it's pretty interesting,  and i'll definitely be paying attention to see where it goes next.
