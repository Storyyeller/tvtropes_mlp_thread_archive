<p></p>The same could be said of any subject. I guess the problem is that you never became interested in math.

            @JT: Yes,  I'm saying that she can move the Equestrian Sun. If she was moved to a different universe,  she'd <em>still</em> be able to move the Equestrian sun (assuming it was brought with her). Now,  I've been <em>assuming</em> that the Equestrian sun is like our sun,  but until recently,  I think that that was a reasonable assumption. Now,  the spoilers from the comic give some idea of the moon's size. Unfortunately there isn't relly overlap between the estimations we get from the two panels (fair enough. It's an artistic representation.). As such,  I don't think that's enough to confirm that they are actully smaller than their RL equivalents,  but I <em>do</em> admit that <em>now</em> it looks like the idea that they're smaller than their RL equivalents has some justification nd that the most supported size is a diameter of <em>very approximately</em> a tenth of their RL equivalent,  therefore,  a thousandth of their volume (and likely their mass as well).
<p></p>What this doesn't <em>change</em> is that this is a very impressive ability.
<p></p>EDIT:
<p></p>Yes. Glad you're feeling better Applelight.

            I could never get into math simply how black and white it is. Either you get the solution,  or you fail completely. In other subjects,  you can study and write out an answer based on what you know and at least get partial credit if your on the right track. Besides,  I learn souly through memorization and mental exercises,  so trying to keep a growing pile of rules and formuli is just painful.

            @D Roy: Problem is that means if you screw it up,  you're boned. Any other subject you can go in with now info and if you know what you're doing you can still come up with a half-decent answer.
<p></p>But yeah,  my biggest issue with math was keeping track of all the forumale and whatever. It also didn't help that it's one of those things where if you accidentally skip a step or something,  you're screwed,  whereas with writing if you miss a comma or whatever you can just go and plug it back in without any trouble.
<p></p>That's the main reason I decided against going into programming. Anything where the entire result can be ruined by one misplaced parenthesis isn't for me.
<p></p>@Sereg: I wasn't trying to dismiss the impressiveness of the ability,  just pointing out why I don't think that ability necessarily implies others.

            Well,  as I've said,  I was just making what I considered fair assumptions. But at the same time,  as I said,  a smaller sun nerfs Celestia <em>way</em> less than some of you were implying. Our sun is over 500 000 times more massive than the earth. And it's mostly hydrogen,  so that's a really low density. Yet most people don't think she can't even <em>planetbust</em>. The sun wouldn't even have to way <em>as much</em> as the Earth and she'd <em>still</em> be able to planetbust simply by slamming the sun <em>into it</em>.

<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> In other subjects,  you can study and write out an answer based on what you know and at least get partial credit if your on the right track.</div>
<p></p>That really depends on the teacher,  not the subject. But nearly every advanced math class I've been in had partial credit.
<p></p>Whether you can get partial credit or not depends on the complexity of the question,  not the subject. For something like 3x+1=2 it's either right or it isn't,  but then again that's also true of a question like 'How many protons does a Carbon atom have?' or 'Which presidential candidate was famous for his Cross of Gold speech?'
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Besides,  I learn souly through memorization and mental exercises,  so trying to keep a growing pile of rules and formuli is just painful. </div>
<p></p>Well the thing is that you shouldn't really have to memorize anything. When you understand the math,  you don't need to memorize formulas. But most teachers don't have time for that,  so they just teach to the test and give you a bunch of crap to memorize,  same as any other subject.

            I was practically unmatched in math all throughout school.  Even in high school,  I could solve most problems in my head faster than others could with a calculator.  I also had a nasty habit of not writing anything down to show how I get to my solutions.
<p></p>By the time college math rolled around,  I dropped out by my second quarter.
