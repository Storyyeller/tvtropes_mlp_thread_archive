            I like the fact that the protagonists aren't perfect. It's more realistic. Which is a slightly silly thing to ask from this show,  I know.

They do on occasion,  but I wouldn't say that it's a common thing.  The fact that they have flaws and have to work to overcome them is what makes the characters so interesting.

            I like each character shows the ability to be arrogant or boneheaded and often walks themselves into a big problem because of it. It works because it is moderated and there are plenty of redeeming moments to balance (hense the controversy with RD in S2) but I often think the more flawed the character can be,  the more interesting they are.
<p></p>I think Lesson Zero,  Applebuck Season and Read It And Weep do a lot for their respective characters for example,  since it's just their flaws causing an excalating dialemma for themselves and nearly the whole focus is just them digging themselves deeper into a very avoidable situation.

It's usually their supporting roles that spotlight their moments of clarity and competence.
<p></p>In the mentioned episodes for example,  it's very easy to pity the leading characters,  but it's still because they are being arrogant buffoons.

<p></p>It helps that usually whenever one character is acting flawed,  another counters it with a moment of clarity.

            YMMV on which episode is the best/worst of Season 3 in action. I personally think "Too Many Pinkie Pies" is so far the "weakest" of the season,  but that's like saying chewy chocolate chip cookies are worse than chunky chocolate chip cookies.
<p></p>Its still chocolate chip cookies,  man!

I can see why most shows go for the Aesop format,  since it usually makes for very character centric stories,  especially ones with rotating spotlight. A character making a mistake with their flaws and having to learn from it is a key in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>,  and as said the supporting cast get opportunities to show clarity and competence foiling it.
<p></p>We could maybe have a few more action based stories,  or at least more subtle Aesops,  but still I'd rather they kept the primary setup for the majority.
<p></p>I do find RD's spotlight episodes a tad painful in places (especially MMDW),  but I still admit they do a lot for her character development wise and show her solo appeal. If she didn't have her huge flawed moments she'd be a much duller character. It's just at that point she didn't have good redeeming roles to balance it (even in some supporting roles she was acting like a jerk). She arguably got her positive aspects developed the least out of all the main six. It's gotten moderated better since then though.

            <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I think it's the premise that fans want to see their favorite characters do well,  when they become the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt Monkey</a> or act like a jerk they cringe and likely disown that moment. But at the same time,  such moments are likely what give them pathos and appeal in the first place. If we just diluted things to their positive roles they would likely be rather dull characters.
<p></p>I remember being like that since a little kid,  when I had a fave character in a show,  I always prefered the "nice/winner X" moments to the "jerk/loser X" ones,  but if they didn't have the latter I likely wouldn't sympathise with them in the first place.
<p></p>I tend to be mixed at this age,  since I can appreciate both in moderation. I actually tend to prefer a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a> acting like an arrogant <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt Monkey</a> for example since it humanizes them so much from their usual role (maybe why I find Twilight and AJ's episodes so enjoyable to watch). But still their primary role is neccessary.
<p></p>I think a good character must have the capacity to be a winner and a loser.
