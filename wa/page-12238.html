            You know,  playing through Mass Effect 2 again,  I have come to the conclusion that Jacob Taylor and AJ face a very similar problem. They are both the fairly normal <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> in groups that are full of quirky,  memorable characters,  and as a result,  are both very forgettable.
<p></p>Of course,  Jacob has it way worse than AJ since he's competing with 12 other characters whereas AJ only has to compete with 5,  but it's the same issue.

            @Perpetual: True,  but there's more than one way of interpreting that.  They might have just been reacting to the fact that Trixie was claiming to have a much wider skill set than any unicorn without a specific "magic" talent would have.

            @JT That bit is from the beginning of the episode,  when Twilight is practicing her magic. In any case,  Spike said "only a little magic",  which I'd prefer to take at face value in saying that other unicorns can't learn off-talent spells period.

            Oh right.  Well,  in that case we could just apply it to Twilight.  It doesn't discount unicorns being able to learn more spells,  it just means most don't bother unless they're really good at it.

            Ok,  now that I've calmed down,  let's get to the story.
<p></p>I was at foal flight camp way back when us foals were starting to get our cutie marks. I,  of course,  didn't have mine at the time. Now,  given that camp sites typically don't have city or town lights to drown out the night sky,  I figured this would give me a perfect opportunity to see clear bright stars.
<p></p>Now,  the camp counselors gave us strict curfews,  especially when my friend tried to have a midnight swim at the lake. Goodness,  did he ever get a scolding. Anyway,  I,  being the annoying colt that I was,  ignored their warnings. I snuck out at night and found a low hanging cloud. Figuring it gave me a good hiding spot,  I quickly flew up and sat on it. Hello night sky! I spent probably a good hour looking at the sky and all of its bright stars.
<p></p>When I felt like I had enough,  I began my flight back down. Then I realized that I wasn't near the camp. Yeah,  that cloud was blowing in the wind in that time. Being so young,  I was freaking out. <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderJayWalking" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderJayWalking">I was lost,  I was scared,  and I going to be scolded by the counselors.</a> But really,  I was pretty upset.
<p></p>Now,  even though I am a star nerd,  believe it or not,  I did not remember where the north star was. Stupid,  I know. So now I am really panicking at this point. Then,  I saw the Orion constellation. For some reason,  I felt calm just looking at it. Then I had this idea; follow the direction of his shield. Now,  I know now that could have been a horrible idea since I was basically flying in a random direction. However,  that idea did get me back to my camp ground.
<p></p>The next day,  while I was making my bed,  my friend pointed out that I had gotten my cutie mark. Since I didn't have it before my night binge,  I figured that I got it during it. I was so excited that I told everypony about it,  including the counselors. Of course they gave me a scolding for breaking a rule,  but not before giving me one of the best dumbstruck looks I've ever seen.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>Anyway,  that's pretty much the jist of it David.
