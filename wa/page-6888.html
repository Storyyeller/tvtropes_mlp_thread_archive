            @ginger: The protagonists got outmaneuvered. They didn't have nearly the kind of numbers they needed,  and late in the game they only started to win because other aliens started to show up to help.
<p></p>They kids did manage to win a few battles,  they were just hugely outnumbered.

            At best the Animorphs were usually able to keep the Yeerks from gaining any ground and on a few occasions were able to give them some setbacks,  but for the most part they were just buying time until they could get allies who had the firepower to help them.

            There were a couple notable Yeerk leaders... I think they were Visser 3 and Visser 1. One of them was incredibly smart and dangerous,  but the other one was a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Ripper</a>.
<p></p>Again,  I'm mostly going off the trope page stuff. I read a few of the books as a kid,  but they were the early ones where the plot was more disconnected and the stakes weren't as high.

            I don't remember Visser 2 ever showing up in the books.  He might have been mentioned,  but I assumed he was off dealing with the war.  Earth wasn't exactly the main priority after all.

            The more I watch the finale the more little details of shear WOW I see,  the drinking scnee,  where Twi is trying to convince all the ponies Cadance is a bitch over drinks,  anytime a pony is sipping at there drink you can see real swallowing motions down there throat as they do so.
<p></p>also,  I'm still convinced Celestia invited the entire Mane 6 to be part of the wedding just so she could subtly get the Elements of Harmony nearby in case of trouble.

            <div class="quoteblock">@Enlong I forget,  weren't there some humans who were perfectly okay with being taken over by Yeerks?
</div>
<p></p>I don't remember any. Yeerk possession is described as being extremely horrible. Not sensory deprivation,  but total loss of control. A prisoner in your own mind. I may be mistaken,  but I don't think there were any humans in the series who willingly entered into that.
<p></p>There were some <em>other</em> species who sort of welcomed the Yeerks. But in the case of the Gedds,  it was because they were barely sapient at all,  more like animals in terms of intelligence. And in the case of the Taxxons,  it was because their lives were already hell,  with an absolutely unending,  unrelenting hunger. Yeerk possession was almost a release for them,  but it also drove the Yeerks mad. Late in the books,  <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a lot of Taxxons also elected to become <em>nothlits</em>.</span>
