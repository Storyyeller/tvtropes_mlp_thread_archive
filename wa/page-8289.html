I prefer Straight Men crippled with a heavy vice than full on perfect ones. Makes them more interesting,  and usually a LOT more funny.

<p></p>@ginger: It's more the fact I find a lot of her Staight Man roles kind of dull,  she often ends up the generic 'normal' pony in Season Two. And no I thought the ending to TLR was very endearing,  but partly because she was humorously flawed in it well so had personality to gain sympathy.
<p></p>There are LOTS of exceptions,  she manages to hold onto a 'warm but abrasive' role for most of Season One for example,  and retains a lot of eccentricities even when the smarter character,  but in Season Two it starts to fade (arguably Williams and Rogers episodes do her the most justice).
<p></p>This is why I adored Lesson Zero,  after figuring Twilight to have a similar dullness problem,  it was fun seeing her act completely nuts,  and since she holds onto her comical neurotics a lot more consistantly in S2 (even in a subtle manner when being the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a>) I consider her 'fixed'. I indeed do revel in character flaws,  they make them likeable.

<p></p>She honestly believes that what she's saying is true... she just can't apply it to herself.
<p></p>In fact,  I think part of why she went nuts during TLR was because by coming home empty handed after promising a load of ribbons and money she'd be seen as a liar

            Maybe hypocrite isnt the right word.  But she does have all these values for her friends that she doesnt seem to apply to herself.  If she says that you shouldnt judge your friends yet expects her friends to judge her... is that just insecurity or something?  I lack a term to define it.
