            yeah that would require introducing 6 new stallions,  setting it,  uphaving the fight...yeah would take WAY to much stuff to happen to cram it into one episode,  and a ton of fans would hate it JUST becuase it sidelines Mane characters for some new guys we don't care about.

            @Bad: One thing that is a pity though is that there was already <em>good</em> drama and conflict in the story. Like how Spike wonders if his feelings for Fluttershy are real or just sympathy and whether or not he's really over Rarity. And Rarity seeing that Spike <em>can</em> date a pony and wondering if she should have rejected him in the first place.

<p></p>Glad to hear you accepted,  when you are over talking with your friends here,  meet me at the TARDIS.
<p></p>@ARD
<p></p>You are a fascinating entity for sure. Not to be a show off but that was because the TARDIS is the best ship on the multiverse.

<p></p>A possible example: Big Mac,  Doctor Whooves,  a male Wonderbolt and some - ok - new guy introduced in a previous episode. Maybe Spike helps them.

<p></p>Well it's only five words long,  so it's not likely. I set it to be biased towards longer posts. This post on the other hand has better chances,  though with over 207k posts in the thread,  it's obviously still extremely unlikely to come up.

            You'd still need characterization and establishment for the Doctor character (d'oh,  ninja'd). Just because most of the fandom associates him with Doctor Who doesn't mean that it'd be enough to just go "here he is,  now roll with it."
<p></p>You know what character I want to see return? Braeburn.

            @Bad: Wow! I just found it! Though I see that it's rated "mature". Whether that is because of the spoiler or because it's <em>going to become</em> clop,  I don't know. It had a decent number of chapters and showed no sign of becoming clop when I last checked though. It's called "Fluttershy's Basement".

            Stories marked as "Mature" tend to designate whether it's because of sex or gore.
<p></p>I saw a Red v Blue crossover that was designated as "Mature." Turns out that it actually didn't have any explicit content and the author was just blithely unaware that the rating is reserved for porn and snuff fics.

            @Badwolfwho: I didn't said it about him specifically,  I said it for *all* characters they decide to use.
<p></p>Anyway,  I'm dragging this for too long. I already said enough for,  when my wishes come true,  and the episode airs,  you can blame it on me for asking it for a desires well.

            @Pannic: The way it's been going,  the most likely reason for it to be labelled "mature" is that it's going to have a gory flashback,  but then again,  I might be wrong.
