            Well for what I know I was in a house in the MLP FIM universe which I guess was Octavia's house in the dream and oddly enough Vinyl Scratch was nowhere to be seen because in every fan vid those two are inseparable together. Why Vinyl wasn't there with Octavia is beyond me. Anyways she was being a bit cranky towards me don't know the reason but she just was. And for some reason Bianca from Spyro the Dragon 3 was in the dream as a cameo.

            Most of my recent dreams tend to be scary. Mine last involved surviving a plague that killed off 90% of the population leaving me to scrounge for supplies. I was doing OK for a week until I started getting the plague myself and had to go into the ruins to search for a cure. I died in 4 days.

            @ Starscream:  Octavia is often portrayed in the fanon as being rather short-tempered with Vinyl.  Maybe your dream was a case of,  "Filling in for Vinyl Scratch tonight will be Starscream."
<p></p>@ Dark:  Wow,  that's a depressing dream. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">

            @dark: I don't mean to trivialize,  but that sounds like the ending to a really,  really depressing post-apocalyptic movie.
<p></p>I had a dream recently while I was taking a nap in an empty meeting room at my office. I woke up and tried to leave the room,  but then I woke up and tried again,  but for some reason my point of view is skewed 90 degrees,  like I'm lying down,  and I can't snap it back. Then I wake up AGAIN,  and now it seems like I have sleep paralysis,  and on and on,  until I actually DO wake up.

            @Syd I guess that would make sense but the only problem to that is I don't even know what I did to make her mad at me. Come to think of it,  the dream never gave a reason to why she was mad at me. It just happened and then I just....woke up.

            For whatever reason,  my worst nightmares take place in the same location. It's a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a> called Rejoice where everything tries to kill you. The planet's surface is covered in a slimy sand with various insects and worms crawl underneath that can burst open at any minute. And wen it does the creatures latch onto your skin and try to eat you alive.
<p></p>Most of the surface is a giant forest with many different kinds of trees; some have delicious fruit,  others have sentiant vines that try and strangle if you get too close. Though you want to stay in the trees around 60 feet up as it's the safest zone. Lower down are all the insects and crawling creatures and higher up it's barren. Everything there is lifeless aside from the hovering giant jellyfish which can hear your pulse and detect you. They work in hives and bring you back to be dissolved with a secrete where your liquified remains will be shared with the hive.
<p></p>And that's just scratching the surface,  I've dreamed about it so much over the years that I remember most of it.

            <em>I get a lot of shopping malls. Nothing interesting. Just malls.</em>
<p></p>My last sort-of FIM dream involved a shopping mall,  but no actual ponies.  I was looking for a store so I could buy...I forget.  Finally found the store outside the mall and to the left.  As I walked toward the store,  I thought,  "While I'm here,  I can check out the Pony section."  That was it.
<p></p>A recurring theme in my dreams lately is that I'm back in school.  Anywhere from kindergarten to (usually) high school,  but often <em>at my current age</em>.  In these dreams,  I sometimes think to myself,  "Why am I here?  Why am I repeating my education?  This makes no sense."  A recurring problem in these dreams is that I don't know my schedule,  and have no idea what class I'm supposed to go to next.  Sometimes I'll just pick one at random.  "This one looks interesting."
