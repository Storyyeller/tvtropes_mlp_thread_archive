            @Seraphem: I was actually fine with the portrayal of Dash in the episode. A little extreme perhaps,  but well within her behavior patterns at that point in the show (and it was more even handed the people give credit for).
<p></p>No I say that the other were worst,  though that is more down to not recognizing implications and lazy writing then anything else.

<p></p>I agree that the episode had problems,  but it's <em>a lot</em> better than it's made out to be. When I first heard that people were calling t the orst episode ever,  I couldn't believe how ridiculous that was. As you can see,  it's not even <em>close</em> to my least favourite episode (it's one of my least favourite <em>season 2</em> episodes,  but that's different).

            Well,  Sonic using the power of Chaos by default is practically canon lol,  it's why he can handle Chaos Emeralds so naturally and figured out Chaos Control by the end of Adventure 2. Also he slows down for the sake of other a lot,  in the CD ending he isn't moving that fast with Amy in his arms,  and when he took part in the Olympics he slows down for the sake of Eggman and Mario and all the other guys who show up.
<p></p>And yes I know cartoon physics lol,  but Dashie is also shown to have <em>excellent</em> weather control,  so it's pretty much a given she would bend her own winds about herself to improve her flight speed.
<p></p>@Ed: It isn't actualy nsfw lol.

            Can we not start up the sun/moon moving thing again?  We have no idea what the relationship between magic and physics is,  so whether magic even follows the laws of physics is kind of a crapshoot.

<p></p>With regards to the sun and the moon,  the current comic arc seems to throw real-life cosmology out the window,  at least with regards to the Moon,  though we don't know the <em>exact</em> details just yet.

            And regarding MMDW I'm kinda in a middle camp on the other mane 5. I think their actions <em>could</em> have been justified,  but the show did a crappy job of it and showed them jumping right to an extreme solution rather than trying anything else first.  If there had been a scene with them sitting Dash down and explaining that she'd hurt someone if she kept the showboating up,  and then resorted to the MMDW thing when it didn't work,  it would have been more palatable.  It also doesn't help that they included that scene where they all pat themselves on the back by talking about how the MMDW is so awesome,  talking only about their own contributions.
<p></p>And yeah,  the cosmology is so different from reality that trying to apply real life physics to it is pretty much an impossible effort.
