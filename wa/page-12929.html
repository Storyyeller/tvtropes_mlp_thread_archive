            Rogers tends to be the best writing AJ's character and giving her solo appeal,  even if she sometimes goes a bit overboard and makes her a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerk Ass</a> (eg. Bridle Gossip overdid it a bit with her overzeal). Most of her defining episodes are written by her. It may be due to Rogers writing mostly for other characters now that AJ gets less exposure and character. Granted she wrote The Last Roundup as well,  which while keeping her original character,  did wane a bit as said.
<p></p>And I still feel Apple Family Reunion didn't quite hit the mark. It felt more like a Pinkie or Twilight type plot,  with the character driving everyone nuts with their overzeal in perfecting something,  but AJ and to an extent the rest of the Apple family were to reserved and unargumentive to really get it going,  so it was mostly just AJ mildly annoying everyone until an accident kicked in. In other words 'the same,  only less'.
<p></p>It may have worked if the other Apples started to conflict over her changes and AJ's overdefensive streak kicked in,  but as is,  felt too mundane and generic.

            @Lurker: Honestly,  I don't think that particular episode went into her motives nearly as much as it could have. I would have found it much more interesting if we knew her motivation from the start,  and then had the episode focus on whether she was conflicted about trying to hide her failure from her friends.  Yes,  there was development,  but it doesn't mean that it was as well done as it could have been.
<p></p>In any case,  I think a good idea for an Applejack episode would be if the other cast members started to take advantage of her helpfulness,  prompting her to get more and more frustrated until she snaps and refuses to help them if they're going to do that. It would be a way of pushing her to her breaking point without focusing on her stubbornness.

            Trust me,  that joke never died. And it will never will. The fandom just can let it go...
<p></p>I agree with Lurker,  the episode was about her but she didn´t need to be the entire episode on screen. Nightmare Moon was the main villain of the first episode and she was on screen like what? five minutes? She was still one of the focus since they have to defeated her.
<p></p>In a unrelated note,  are you listening to the Everfree radio best songs stream? I missed the first couple songs but I´m catching up now.

Nightmare Moon was an important aspect of the plot,  but her characterization was never an important element of those episodes.

            ok,  time for an episode day fanfic report!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Dear Thread Manor...
<p></p>only 5 fics today,  but the really cover the spectrum as far as story types go! Lets start with a first for my fanfic reports,  a fanfic that I would <em>not</em> recommend to anyone.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/57081/day-one">Day One<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. A human winds up in Equestria,  except it's not not a very realistic Equestria,  it's 100% cartoon Equestria. All the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsLackAttributes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsLackAttributes">Animals Lack Attributes</a>,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyPoops" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyPoops">Nobody Poops</a>,  and to top it all off,  the world itself doesn't seem to appreciate the human seeing just how far he can bend the limits of this cartoon world. Will he ever be able to get home?
<p></p>This was the strangest story. I was really enjoying reading it,  right up until the final chapter. Suddenly,  a giant <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> comes out of nowhere out and sorta kinda resolves the plot(it's left unclear exactly what happens) in a most unsatisfactory manner. I do not recommend this story,  it's just setting you up for disappointment.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/59276/yesterday-is-today">Yesterday Is Today<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> -in progress. Discord has been defeated,  and Canterlot is in full celebration mode. That is,  until Celestia and Twilight set off a trap left by Discord when they return the Le3memtns of Harmony to their special storage room. The trap levels Canterlot Castle,  and would have consumed all of Canterlot had Celestia not managed to contain it from the ceneter of the destruction,  where she was trapped. When Twilight re-enters the ruins of Canterlot to find Celestia,  but she doesn't find the loving,  caring mentor that she remembers. She instead finds a battle hardened warrior of blood and iron. he instead finds the Celestia that originally fought Discord over 1000 years ago. How will this warscarred Celestia adapt to modern day Equestria?
<p></p>This one looks like it will be real interesting,  but it's still a bit too early to tell. I'm definitely keeping an eye on it though.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/66313/more-than-her-mane">More Than Her Mane<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. When Spike greet Pinkie at the Library,  he's shocked and worried to see her mane and tail are flat and straight. Pinkie assures him that it's just a new look she's trying out and that there's nothing wrong,  and is eventually able to convince him of the fact. However,  when the rest of Pinkies friends see her,  they're not so easy to convince...
<p></p>a short one shot slice of life type story. It's certainly worth a read.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/67672/apples-and-wheat">Apples and Wheat<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>- in progress. The Apple Family is,  for the first time in years,  planting some wheat on the farm. Granny Smith performs an old ritual that summons a familiar <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf">wise old wolf spirit,  Holo</a>,  to help them with their wheat farming. Much shenanigans and Apple family backstory ensue.
<p></p>I've never read/seen Spice And Wolf,  but I enjoyed what's there so far. Will be following this. and maybe watch a few episodes of spice and wolf,  the concept of the show seems pretty neat.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/4061/interview-with-a-princess">Interview With A Princess<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. On a whim,  and not really expecting anything to happen,  a man writes a letter to Princess Celestia requesting an interview with her and burns it in a firepit in his backyard. Imagine his surprise then,  when Celestia shows and up agrees to do an interview! Much exposition on Earth/Equestria ensues.
<p></p>This seemed mostly a way for the author to throw out some headcannon of his without having to really make a plot to fit it,  but it's really well written,  so I'd recommend it.
<p></p>That's all for today all,  see you next time!

            I really think they should do another AJ and RD plot,  except instead emphasizing how similar they are they could show how different they can be when things get down to it. I always thought the more antagonistic dynamic that they had going in Merriweather's early episodes was more interesting then their usual friendly rival thing,  but that's probably just me.

            I agree RD is a good foil for AJ,  in that it shows the latter as clearly the more responsible and level headed of the two,  but at the same time RD is provokative enough to rile up AJ and bring out her temper and rivalistic overzeal. I find their bouts amusing because a lot of the time AJ's motive seems to devolve less about keeping order and more just getting RD back (eg. Fall Weather Friends,  the window gag in Hearth's Warming Eve).

            @Psi 001: I agree. I actually think that AJ could actually be something of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> under the right circumstances,  and seems to be the one who is more likely to hold a grudge. That actually might make an interesting role reversal for AJ and RD.

            I think the nearest to a recurring shtick for AJ originally was that she the character that was always trying to be the nice guy,  and play fair and logically,  but in the end her temper and pride were riled up by a more obnoxious character and caused her to act almost as bad as the ones she butted heads with.
<p></p>Where Twilight would alway try in vain to lecture others to her level and never get the point,  AJ would be the opposite and all to easily revert to a "two wrongs make a right" ethic.
<p></p>I think there was amusement in that even during the times she did keep hold of her clarity,  you could really see her temper and nerves being grated on ("Be a good sport,  Applejack..."). She only wants what's best,  but she was a ticking time bomb.
