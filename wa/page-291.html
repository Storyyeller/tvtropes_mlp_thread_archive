            Well,  that's different.
<p></p>I encountered her on the internet,  so I'm not really sure it WAS me.  But don't worry,  I'm alright with you making that comic.  Even though I'd never attack myself or my friends.  But go on,  you can make it.

            @ kegisak from several pages ago
<p></p>Well,  my fic is sort of a return to the "epic" nature of the two pilot episodes,  except that instead of Nightmare Moon,  the group is fighting a new unicorn/pegasus/earth pony hybrid,  another <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> that was cast out of the place that Luna and Celestia came from,  who was cast out a very long time ago and was recently released by an army of ponies that heard of his banishment and thought that he was in the right (exactly what he was imprisoned for I haven't thought up yet).
<p></p>Meanwhile,  in Canterlot,  Quarter Note is a guard/court musician,  who Celestia says likes music more than guarding. So she sends Quarter Note to Ponyville on indefinite leave,  and he meets the main cast and eventually develops a crush on Fluttershy. He has a few <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> adventures before eventually planning a concert that Celestia attends,  which is when the villain makes his move,  taking over Canterlot with his forces and driving Celestia's followers out of the city. Celestia is able to build a ragtag army from her own guards and several ponies from Ponyville,  and takes them on,  in a battle that will determine the fate of Equestria.
<p></p>It's sort-of coming along right now,  he's gotten to Ponyville and met Twilight but that's as far as I've gotten due to having a packed schedule over the past week. And I'm going to Europe in a few days so I can't work on it there...
<p></p>And this Quarter Note isn't really the same one from the RP,  just so you know.

            Agh,  figures after I do a quick edit on my post,  this goes to the next page.  See my last post for the older links.
<p></p>@Fallen: Yes,  she's a very experience combatant with extremely good control of her magic.  Plus she needs to present a challenge to the main six while they're still scattered (although once the elements of harmony get going... weee,  this is fun to write).
<p></p>@Twilight: You wouldn't fight yourself,  even if your other self was a threat to you,  your friends and possibly portions of Equestria (I imagine Evil Twilight wouldn't be able to take on Celestia,  though).
<p></p>EDIT: @Fallen again: Hehe,  those expressions are great.  With the way you present the imagery,  you almost don't need dialogue.

            ah,  who knows. Maybe they'd change their tune if they saw it close up. Maybe even seeing the show itself would be enough. We can always hope,  can't we?

            Well I'm not dropping it,  just putting it on hold for a bit.
