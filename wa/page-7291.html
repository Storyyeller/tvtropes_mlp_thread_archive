            <span class="blue">@Chadaman:I don't think she was cheating,  but I do think they should have set actual rules and started the competition over.  The competition was initially started purely as a friendly rivalry with no serous stakes,  so it shouldn't be a big deal if Rainbow has a bit of an advantage.  The biggest issue with that episode,  I think,  is that there simply is NO WAY to make it a fair competition.  Allowing Rainbow to use her wings gives her a big advantage.  Not allowing her to use her wings gives her a big handicap.  The fact is,  Rainbow and Applejack have two different specific skill sets that they have no way to fairly test against each other.  They both should have just come to that conclusion and decided the contest didn't matter.</span>

            Okay,  Chada. If you really wanna know,  I think that while RD wasn't technically cheating (since it wasn't spelled out by the rules beforehand),  she was going against the spirit of the games she used her wings in,  since she was using muscles to win that weren't meant to be used in those games For example,  Long Jumping compares how strong ones leg muscles and jumping abilities are. Wings should never be involved.
<p></p>That's just me though,  and Bad has argued with me COUNTLESS times before about this

            I'm back,  just watched the Avengers Movie :D
<p></p>It was <em>awesome</em>. Also how did Tony find out how to do the falling assembly bit with the mark 7 like that that's totally my source code <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>At least he hasn't figured the fast/smooth collapsible design yet :V
<p></p>I'm wondering how pony!Natasha would look like :3 also Loki you should have taken up Tony's offer of a drink,  his liquor collection is crazy good. Dolt.
<p></p>Now I'm curious to see the Mane Six's reaction if you take them to watch the Avengers movie.

            Someone should make a fic like <em>Elements of Gaming</em> where it's like <em>Elements of Movie-Going</em> instead. Basically Ponyville gets a movie theater and the chapters focus on the mane cast's reactions to what's happening in the movie.
