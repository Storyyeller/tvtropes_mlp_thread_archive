            Well,  I'm back from seeing The Cabin in the Woods.  It was pretty good,  I suppose.  The best thing about the whole thing?  I had the whole theater to myself as there was no one else at the screening I went to.  No distraction in the form of people checking their phones or refusing to be quiet,  just me and the movie.  Good times.

            @Lurker Well a lot of the concepts are GENUINELY interesting and scary. There's no harm in it,  right? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">
<p></p>And I think they don't want to try any method of killing 682 where they can't confirm it's death 100%. It's just too dangerous

            @ gingerninja  173 is only thing what 682 is afraid of.  And because 173 was first  SCP.

            173 just looks silly. I honestly can't see how any of these are interesting. Too much mystery involved,  not enough answers. Which is probably the point,  I assume. <br> <br>Has Cabin in the Woods been in theaters long if it was empty?
