Plus she has Spike.

            I think part of it is that certain characters wouldn't really be interesting to watch in one-on-one interactions.  Like Twilight and Fluttershy would probably get along great,  but they're both so reserved that it wouldn't really be interesting to watch them unless some sort of external conflict was happening.  That's why interactions between say,  Applejack and Rarity are more common; the characters are different enough that their interactions are more fun to watch.  Some pony combinations just don't make for as interesting shows,  and since storytelling is built on conflict,  the writers are more likely to put the ponies together in combinations that result in conflict.

It'd be hilarious to see,  using your example,  Twilight struggling to come up with something to say to Fluttershy. Though yeah,  unless that's a part of the conflict of the week that would be a waste of the episode's time.

            What are you talking about?  Some of the funniest scenes have starred only Twilight Sparkle and Fluttershy.  Have you not seen "Green Isn't Your Color" or "A Bird in the Hoof"?

The scenes from Green Isn't Your Color and A Bird in the Hoof are both more situational humor than character humor.  The plot causes their interaction rather than their interaction triggering the plot. Like in Green Isn't Your Color,  it's the conflict of interest between Fluttershy and Rarity that drives the plot; the scene with Fluttershy and Twilight came about as a result of it.   And I'm not saying that it can't be done,  just that you'd have to go to more effort on a Twilight/Fluttershy-based plot than say,  Applejack/Rarity.

            I don't see Spike "hooking up" with any pony other than Rarity - not only does he have a thing for her,  but he was raised from hatching by Twilight,  which means he probably considers her his adoptive parent more than anything else,  and shipping him with the other ponies is just plain weird. Also,  he is clearly Twilight's familiar,  which is a fancy term for "wizard's slave for life".
<p></p>Now,  putting the shipping aside for a moment,  how come Spike doesn't have any wings? It seems odd since every dragon so far has had wings,  minus Spike. Do they grow in latter on in life,  is he just a member of a species we haven't seen before,  or did they clip his wings when he was enslaved by the pony overlords? Because even though having creepy bat wings would probably make him terrifying,  he wouldn't have to fall off ladders every other episode if he had a pair.
<p></p>Ha ha,  the stupid dragon fell again! What a douche! &gt;Ponies mock Spike&lt;
<p></p>This is now a thread about Spike.

            Eh,  it hasn't really been touched on. Most people either figure his wings grow in later,  or he's just a breed of dragon that doesn't have them. He was born without,  after all.
<p></p>I don't really see him 'hooking up' with any of them. It's not the cross-species thing that gets me,  it's the lifespan thing. Like,  his aging process might put him at about the right size at the right time,  but I don't really like thinking of the poor guy falling in love and then having his heart broken when generations pass by him. But then,  maybe he could become the patriarch of a clan,  and he'd always have his offspring to keep him company - assuming he could have kids with a pony.

Or they record the episodes that don't require her,  if they do the "shove the whole cast in a room and let 'em go" style of acting,  which I think they do. So yeah,  we'll get a few episodes without Dash or AJ. It's not like we didn't have those this or past season. I'm sure they'll be well spread-out.

In it,  <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Luna tells Spike that his natural,  inborn jealousy and territoriality can come to serve him,  as the ponies who are 'his' will be his family - he'll safeguard their success,  safety and happiness as he would his own.</span>  So in a way,  he <em>would</em> be a patriarch.

Your choice of words makes me wonder if you have a rather grim view of the world. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>Seriously speaking,  though,  I very much doubt that that's the way Twilight looks at Spike.
<p></p>On a similar note,  I wonder how Spike's "you're not mommy" line in <em>Winter Wrap Up</em> factors in.
