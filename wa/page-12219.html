            They both cast their spells at relatively the same time. If Celestia used something else,  Chrysalis's beam would have just hit her with no resistance.

            Celestia and Chrysalis faced off each other for more than ten seconds. I think she could have saved her threat/boast after incapicitating her.
<p></p>In addition,  Chrysalis was showing her back against her before that,  although it could have explained away as Celestia would never shoot someone in the back.
<p></p>Also,  why did Celestia have to connect the beam anyway? Sure,  it might have made a bit of a hole on the ceiling,  but I doubt that it was powerful enough to cause enough damage on the ceiling as to damage the guests. Couldn't she have just teleported right in front of her and blasted Chrysalis point blank?

            Well,  it was powerful enough to take Celestia out,  so it must have been pretty powerful.  I'm chalking it up to the fact that Celestia isn't fan of direct confrontation; she can manage if she has to but generally prefers planning things out rather than just charging.

            I say that had Celestia just hit her full blast immediately,  she would've won with minimal effort. She held back long enough to realize that Chrysalis <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicLink" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicLink">was still taking power</a> from SA,  and breaking their link accidentally could cause significant (possibly permanent) damage to the latter (especially considering his weakened state). She couldn't bring herself to go through with it.

            @d Roy You're assuming that Chrysalis is an incompetent magical combatant. She knew Celestia was there,  since Celestia was <em>officiating the wedding</em>,  so there's no opportunity for a sneak attack. We've seen teleportation before,  and it isn't instantaneous,  so Chrysalis could have reacted. Since Celestia didn't know that she could have been overpowered,  the direct approach was objectively the best,  given the circumstances and the parties involved.

            @Perpetual - Actually,  I checked the fight scene and the way Chrysalis reacted pretty much says that "Oh yeah,  you were there,  forgot about that." Again,  they were facing each other for much longer than necessary. I would have understood if Celestia was going for a more diplomatic solution,  but it was clear enough that she had direct force in her mind to begin with.

            @Perpetual - She announced that she will conquer the entire Equestria. That is a basically a <em>proclamation of war.</em> You do not proclaim a <em>war</em> if you have any intention to surrender.
<p></p>What Chrysalis is doing is equivalent to crashing a wedding party,  full of political figures and guards,  and announce that you will assault everyone. You don't get any offer of surrender; you get a blast of leads.
<p></p>There are differences between being a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatist</a> and being more tactical.

            @d Roy You get to do things like that when you're the most powerful being in the land. Even Chrysalis herself wasn't 100% sure that she was more powerful than Celestia at that point,  so I guess you could say that Celestia was just overconfident. Who wouldn't be,  in her position?

            @D Roy: She's also mind-controlling one of the most powerful unicorns in the kingdom,  and she's more than powerful enough to cause a ton of collateral damage before they could take her down.  It's entirely possible Celestia wanted to be cautious not to hurt any of her subjects,  so she took stock of the situation and judged her foe before charging recklessly.  It's in her character to want to think things over.  If it had been Luna or RD then yeah,  she would have attacked,  but Celestia's usually more cool than that.  She's not going to blindly attack an enemy that might be able to defeat her.  My guess what happened is that she hesitated to weigh the odds of winning vs. calling for help or evacuating or whatever,  decided to attack,  then realized that she misjudged Chrysalis' power level.  Which is understandable given that she had no idea Chrysalis was even there 2 minutes earlier.  She had a <em>lot</em> of information to process.
<p></p>Also,  she's probably a bit rusty from hundreds of years of not fighting directly.
<p></p>TL;DR it's entirely valid to say that she might not have taken the best course of action in that situation,  but it also doesn't mean that she was being stupid for acting the way she did.  Her actions made perfect sense from her perspective,  they just didn't work out ideally.  Hindsight is 20/20 after all.

            I would like to argue further (if I had all the time,  I can see this going on for many pages),  but I have to wake up at 5 AM tomorrow so I am calling it a day.
