            I think that Celestia <em>could</em> have used a more powerful combat spell against Chrysalis. It's just that doing so would require endangering a whole room full of ponies. Of course,  Chrysalis could probably still beat her in a head on fight thanks to the love power,  but it wouldn't have ended in a single <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar">Beam-O-War</a>.

            It's also possible that in Celestia and Luna's case they have most of their power tied up in the sun and moon,  and so while they're technically on an absurd power tier,  in practice they're not that much more powerful than an exceptional unicorn.

            I think  Disqord  just toyed with them in that moment,  so she could break his magic.  Elements were charged later.

            @Steve: Several millennia ago the council of the divine convened after a conflict between two gods resulted in the destruction and near-genocide of the kingdom of Fabelan. The agressor in the conflict was forced to disperse most of his power and reincarnate as a mortal. It was also decided that due to their power gods were not allowed to be involved in any mortal conflict unless another broke the pact first,  in which case they would be allowed to step in. The decision stipulated,  though,  that if the gods were required to use anything beyond 15% of their full ability they would need to leave the continent and find a deserted area in which to battle,  no smaller than 100 miles in radius.
<p></p>There were several discussion afterwords to decide the details of just what constituted a mortal conflict and what they could lend their aide with,  what constituted divine intervention and which situations divine intervention would be acceptable. Due to these discussion is was eventually decided that the defending goddess was <em>not</em> to be considered guilty,  although she still no longer function as the patron deity of any country due to the extended toll the conflict took on her and her subject. She is still a member of the council of the divine,  though she attends very few meetings and is generally looked down upon for being somewhat callous and out of the loop.

            Agreed about Celestia holding back.

Celestia got Luna out the way,  but she was hit as a result. I can see something like that happening before which makes Celestia reluctant to cut loose.
