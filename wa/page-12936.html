            1. they are still sleeping through her night,  and obviously cherish her sisters say more,  what does her being with them as they dream have to with them no appreciating all the work she does and we don't know how many ponies she can be in the dreams of at a time?
<p></p>2. what? I,  I can't even begin to follow that.
<p></p>3.And we've seen EVERYTHING they are able to do right? What? Till you have a canon list of every single possible thing they can do,  you can't complain about one not being able to do X when we don't KNOW they can't
<p></p>4.how do we know she didn't? hell I think it's even LIKELY she did just that,  hence the name NIGHTMARE Moon.
<p></p>5.Again your basing an argument on a personal supposition,  that she's more powerful then Celestia,  for which there is NO evidence,  AND assuming that they were grateful. If they were,  then there wouldn't be an issue so obviously they were not. We know what happened,  and nothing contradict the established facts,  at all.
<p></p>yeah I got no problem with people having different views of likes and what not,  but that is nearing Chatoancy levels of Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. basing arguments entirely on headcanon when what we've seen either has no evidence,  or even contrary evidence to the point.

            @ Alesiopdv: Okay,  let's take this point by point:
<p></p>1. Just because she can contact them in their dreams doesn't mean they were happy about it or wanted to see her.  For all we know they disliked the fact that she kept showing up.  Just because they sleep doesn't mean they sleep through the entire night.
<p></p>2. The problem isn't that she has that duty,  the problem was that she wasn't appreciated for doing it.  This complaint basically relies on the assumption that she was totally content with only interacting with her subjects in their sleep,  and letting her sister receive pretty much all the waking interaction.
<p></p>3. We have no clue what other powers Celestia has,  or what the relative power levels of the two sisters are.  As far as we know,  Celestia <em>could</em> do the dream thing,  she just doesn't for whatever reason. Or she has other powers that Luna doesn't.  We know so little about the princesses that we can't say whether they're OP or not without resorting to pure conjecture.
<p></p>4. We don't know how much power she has within the dreams.  As far as we know it's limited to being able to influence dreams one at a time,  which isn't exactly conducive for war.
<p></p>5. Like before,  this relies entirely on assumptions about the situation between Celestia and Luna that we simply have no information on.  Even if Luna <em>is</em> more powerful than Celestia,  she could still be jealous of the fact that the ponies liked Celestia more.  We really know <em>very</em> little about the situation when Luna went rogue.  Literally our only info is the stuff we get in the prologue,  which is obviously a very condensed account of what happened.
<p></p>Basically,  it seems to me like you're reading a <em>lot</em> into certain events and character motivations that the show doesn't really give us much info on.  All we know is that Luna was jealous enough to attempt to take out Celestia.  Nothing about Luna's dreamwalker powers contradicts that.  There's no reason to assume that say,  the ponies liked Luna's dreamwalking powers,  or that she considered it worth not being as popular as her sister.

            I think it's safe to say Celestia has abilities which haven't been shown yet as well.

            I'd be very surprised if Celestia didn't have booku abilities that we don't yet know of. I expect her magic is loaded for bear. Or pony.

            I´m sorry to say nobody is ever going to talk me out of this one.
<p></p>Good points but as you says there isn´t enoguh information and until there is official information from the show to me (my personal opinion) this is a bloody retcon,  giving a well established character a new set of powers for absolutely no reason other than have a pointless cameo (if you are interested check out Mr.Poniator tumblr where he explains why he thinks Princess Luna appeareance makes no sense from a story perspective and that anybody who watches withouht knowing Luna will be totally confused and I agree with him,  it makes no sense) and totally contradicts the canon.
<p></p>I´m sorry but like I said this is the same as that idiotic Parallax thing. If you don´t know what I´m talking about I´ll summarize; Green Lanter was a hero,  the city he protected was destroyed by an alien invasion,  eh went crazy and turned into a villian,  he realized his mistakes and sacrificed his life to save the earth....oh expect he wasn´t crazy at all,  he was possed by an alien bug and he isn´t dead anymore because one writer didn´t like him being dead! GAH I hated that!
<p></p>Like I said,  i know the show doesn´t give any information but based on what I got this is a retcon,  it changes everything and it makes no sense. I can still watch the show but Princess luna is ruined for me...and if tha theory about Discord is proved to be true that is also ruined for me because once again,  its a retcon! Telling you that something that they just invented for this episode actually happened many years ago and thus it matters on the whole storyline.
<p></p>I´ll just say this...I hate retcons!!

            Man,  depending on what dreams her subjects had,  I can totally imagine that <em>fueling</em> her jealousy.
<p></p>"They sleep during my night,  only to dream of sunshine! Even as they <em>sleep</em>,  they think of nothing but my sister!"
<p></p>"The only time they think of the night is in nightmares! Well,  if <em>fear</em> is what gets their attention,  so be it."
<p></p>And man,  we've not seen nearly the extent of Celestia's powers. Remember her immediate antimagic in Lesson Zero? If Chrysalis's reaction is any indication,  Celestia's reputation in the field of magic precedes her.

            and,  fine beleive what you want just,  how,  seriously I'm struggling to undersatnd,  you built up a whole array of why it's a bad idea,  all being based around information that exists,  only in your head,  which you cliam it's the show runners job to diprove...even though again,  it only exists for you...andyou hate the episode...becuase you created a headcanon that makes it be bad..and..does not compute...error...error
<p></p>and,  this is not me being upset at you for not liking it,  this is,  I literally cannot fathom how you can come to those conclusion,  at all.....

            But... but <em>it isn't a retcon unless it changes previously established plot points</em> and this doesn't.  It only contradicts the information that you extrapolated from the 30-second blurb in the first episode.
<p></p>I'll say it again: literally <em>all we know</em> is that Luna was jealous of Celestia because the ponies didn't like the night,  so she tried to make it last forever.  That is the sum total of information that we <em>know</em> about the situation.  Anything beyond that is conjecture.  I fail to see how "Luna has the ability to enter dreams" in any way contradicts "Luna was unhappy that the ponies preferred the day to the night" unless you make a <em>lot</em> of assumptions about the setting.
<p></p>You're free to dislike it,  but you can't blame the show for not adhering to your headcanon.

            Woah,  somebody did that? Yeah,  I admit its just my personal problem. Call it headcanon if you will but I just cant wrap my head about her sudden powers. And yeah I can´t remember the name of the tropes but suddenly having powers that could have been useful before but never bothered to use them is something that bothers me in any kind of series.
<p></p>Thank god Applejack parents were really dead,  have they show up withouth explanation on the reunion I would have gone crazy...

<p></p>Iiiiiiin any case it's not like Luna's powers were clearly defined apart from her shapeshifting powers and the usual Moon powerset. And looks like a majority of fanon got her Dream Diver powers spot-on,  from Progress to that other one where Luna got trapped in her own nightmare of becoming Nightmare Moon.

<p></p>And ANYTHING about the past is 100% fan-wank so doesn't count. fact is,  she has these powers,  what happeend in the past happened,  therefore the two DO go together,  and there is dozens of explanations for how,  versus the one you CHOOSE to think which doesn't thereby ignoring facts presented.
