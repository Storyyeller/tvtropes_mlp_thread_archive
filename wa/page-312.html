            Ah,  crap. To my shock and horror,  I came up with an idea for an MLP fan fic myself. It would be very long and expansive story,  something I couldn't really afford to write. My current venture into Evangelion fan fiction is already a distraction from original projects that I don't need,  so I categorically do NOT want to start something else too. I just know this is going to start bugging me.

Although the shock and horror was because of the content of the fanfic idea itself.  I suppose I lied a little bit when I said I couldn't let irrevocable harm come to the main six,  since my comic already had a scarred Twilight.  I started thinking about expanding on the back story of the alternate continuity and how Twilight's first attempt to defeat Nightmare Moon went to pieces,  diverging the continuity from canon.  But that meant I also had to explain the scars,  which I thought to attribute to Nightmare Moon.  But as my mind continued to work,  things started getting pretty dark and graphic and the horror hit me when I'd realized just how far the mental image had gone.  And I stopped myself and dropped it right there.  I realize if I did write it,  some people would probably find it mild,  but I didn't take interest in this so I could corrupt it. :/

<p></p>The basic premise of Light and Dark is the gods do a grand experiment creating a world one side all Id and the other all Ego,  and never the twain shall meet,  until the gods get bored nd let the barrier weaken,  the ponies exist on their own island,  similarlly barrier,  a personal project of one of the gods,  and again as that barrier weakens the Light and Dark sides and the ponies,  who never knew the other existed start to cross paths.

<p></p>Thanks for the welcome!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">
<p></p>Anyway,  I have a fanfic idea that could be interesting.  Here's a basic outline of the story I've got:
<p></p>Deputy Chrispy Creme of the Ponyville Sheriff's Department had always enjoyed his line of work.  That is,  until the Sherriff and the other deputies are injured foiling a bank job perpetrated by the notorious <em>Banoffee Bill</em> Gang.  With the entire force hospital stricken except for Creme,  the responsibility of upholding law and order in Ponyville now rests solely with him.  And he is out of his depth.....
<p></p>.....but then he remembers that Ponyville is home to the welders of the Elements of Harmony,  who have tackled much greater problems than littering and a gang of pie throwing robbers.  Following the Sheriff's advice,  he enlists the help of Twilight and the rest of the main cast,  even if they aren't so keen to help out.....
<p></p>What do you all think?

            Oh man,  I can imagine Twilight trying to do forensic investigations...I guess this would be more on the silly side of the fanfic scale?
<p></p>I actually had a pretty neat idea for another fanfic just this morning. It's sorta grimdark; the idea is that there's an organization in Equestria dedicated to the promotion and upholding of 'racial purity',  essentially keeping unicorns,  pegasi and earth ponies from breeding among each other. Sort of an Equestrian Klu Klux Klan. It's not generally a problem,  but recently a more militaristic section has shown up,  under the leadership of one known only as Salem. He has a knack for finding 'half-breeds',  and his followers round them up...to who knows what end.
<p></p>It follows four half-breed ponies; Derpy Hooves(1/2 unicorn),  Carrot Top(1/2 Unicorn),  Lyra(1/2 pegasus - I think it was originally supposed to be Rarity,  but I don't know how the reaction to a mane being through all this would be) and...I can't exactly recall the fourth one. The whole idea actually came from a dream,  and I remember a fourth pony,  but not much beyond that. She was one of the purple ones,  if I recall,  but eh. The four of them flee to the countryside separately,  but soon come together,  trying to outrun or hide from the ever vigilant Salem,  and find a place where they can be at peace. I kinda get the feeling it would be set before the series (another reason not to include Rarity),  and would sort of be a 'how they got there' thing - since Carrot Top and Derpy are fanon roomies,  and I've seem a few picks with them interacting with Lyra in some way.

            OK,  so in Everfree Forest the plants and animals grow (gasp!) wild,  and weather is uncontrolled by the public weather service.
<p></p>What about lands outside actual pony control,  where non-pony sapients like buffalo and zebra and,  heck,  yaks and reindeer (never seen,  just making shit up) live? Do they do their own thing with the bunnies and clouds - they dont have any flyers among themselves but they might have friendly animals that help them - and tend to animals and plants as the ponies do? Or are they too "barbarian" (from a pony point of view,  of course) to do that?

            It's pretty hard to say...It's stated a few times that there are places outside of Equestria,  but it's never really touched on beyond that. We know that the buffalo have some effect on their environment - their stampeding grounds were flat simply because they were the stampeding grounds - but that's about it...and of course,  if the mane six's reaction to Zecora is anything to go by,  most ponies don't really know anything about the world outside of Equestria.

            That brings me to the question that always runs through my mind: Did the ponies use their magic so carelessly that they made the environment dependent on them?  Or was there some kind of apocalypse that wrecked most of the planet,  and the ponies have been using their skills to slowly repair the damage?  (If going by the "future of Generation 1" theory,  maybe some supervillain went so overboard in attacking Dream Valley as to curse all the other lands.)

<p></p>I had sort of thought of the world as Equestria,  but it is probably better to think of that as "the Pony Principality" or whatever (Celestia is obviously not a QUEEN). Though its ruler is the SUN GODDESS,  so you'd assume she has some interest in other parts as well... or maybe not. "Oh,  its only PONIES that were created in my image! The rest just sprouted from the primordial ooze..." ;)

            ^^ It's not like we haven't done the same ourselves (and it's not as bad as you make it sound). Domesticated animals don't do so well if you put them back in the wild. Often,  they just die out there,  unless you slowly recondition them.
<p></p>In the case of the ponies,  they've somehow domesticated/civilized/[verbed] the whole of Equestria (except for Everfree Forest). Outside that,  nature just does its own thing.
<p></p>That's my theory,  anyway.

Was even pondering a sort of 3 tier society since they have a definite end to their world we have Pony ville and the lin on the earth,  a network of cities in the clouds for the Pegasai,  and a underground network probably populated by "dwarf" ponies and the Diamond dogs.
<p></p>On a related subject,  if the ponies were to enter int oa clasic Dungons and Dragons settings (and lets assume they don't have any class training like in World of Ponycraft)
<p></p>what would you see their fighting styles like.
<p></p>I see Applejack doing hind kicks,  head buts,  and charges. But for Twilight I'd imagines telekenetics shoves,  knockdowns,  holds,  stuns,  basicly lots of delay move but not direct attacks. Dash would probably do lots of high speed flybys. But the others?
<p></p>Also:
Posted some more info on my RPG here,  some feature notes,  some screen shots,  keep in mind this is the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaD" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaD">La D</a> parts as i don't have Pony sprites or tiles to do the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a> parts as of yet
