<p></p>This Saturday,  the stream will be a "3rd Telecast" (lol) of the S2 Finale,  DOUBLE FEATURE. Think of it as practice for the S3 streams,  at New Pony Time (11PM GMT+8).

            Saying "magic" is just too broad. At best,  everyone can cast telekinesis,  but beyond that? Most unicorns have maybe one or two other spells. I doubt anyone other than Twilight can pick up Rarity's gem-finding,  and I don't expect Rarity to start conjuring rope anytime soon.

            I'm just saying,  if you just say "magic" and end it there,  you're kind of implying that everyone can walk on clouds and shoot magic bolts and teleport across town. Telekinesis is awesome,  yeah,  but that's about where the "every unicorn can do this" line ends.

            @Blue: It basically comes down to lack of info.  I do think there's something of a trend in showing Earth Ponies taking on more manual labor than other ponies do,  but it really depends on how you interpret what little info we have.  You do have a point about the flying thing,  but I think the magic aspect is so limited for most unicorns that it doesn't really give them an enormous advantage in day to day life.  I mean,  if an earth pony can be dextrous enough to play a cello or piano,  I doubt a lack of Telekinesis would really trouble them much (especially given that we have no clue what an average range of TK is; for all we know the average unicorn can't manipulate any objects they couldn't reach out an grab with their hooves).  The other thing is that I think in general,  EP's would naturally develop more physical skill to compensate the lack of magic,  but that's just conjecture on my part.
<p></p>Anyway,  I should probably go to sleep now. Had to wake up early.  Hopefully I'll still be able to get online tomorrow.  My building had power through the storm last year,  so I <em>think</em> I'll be okay.  Goodnight everybody.

            It's not like ponies are even hampered by the lack of telekinesis. In show they're acrobatic enough to manipulate everything with their mouths and tails anyway.
