            That's why a few friends I've recently gotten to join the herd know nothing about Princess Twilight. Hopefully,  they can at least get the surprise it should have been.

            Know what the REALLY strange part is?!  The producers of the show say that <em>Magical Mystery Cure</em> is the first of a three-parter!!!  :O  So why did they even compress so much into one episode?!
<p></p>Apparently,  the last episode AND the rest of the third season was bad enough for long-time brony,  CR of <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamiliarFaces" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamiliarFaces">Familiar Faces</a></em>,  to renounce his status as a fan and do a complete 180!!  I disagree that the other 12 episodes of Season 3 were bad,  though.

            @Purple Dalek: Exactly. That's what fails to reassure me â€” unless it's meaningless,  which such a drastic change <em>shouldn't</em> be,  then how the hell can you possibly hope to maintain the character dynamic of the series <em>in statu quo?</em> Either it <em>does</em> change everything,  which will piss the fans off,  or it's a stupid and pointless alteration,  which will piss the fans off.

            Something to remember is that MMC was written when they weren't sure that the show would get renewed. It's set up such that it could easily be the end of the series. Whatever comes in Season 4 will continue the story,  but it wasn't originally written that way.

            It's clear that they wrote the stories in the episode (yes,  I said "stories,  not "STORY") because they may have been written when they weren't sure how long Season 3 would be.  Then,  once they found out it could only be 13 episodes long,  they said "screw it,  squash both stories into one episode and have it be a musical to cover up all the story holes!!"

            Once Season 4 comes around,  I just hope they don't end this 3-parter with Twilight becoming a regular unicorn again,  because I think that would anger the fans more than if she stays a princess!  All that bad writing FOR NOTHING!?!?

            @Kyun ...No. That's not how things work. The episodes are ordered before scripts are written. If Hasbro orders a 13 episode season,  and gives them exactly 1 episode for Princess Twilight,  then that's what they get.
<p></p>And aside from being compressed,  what was <em>bad</em> about it? What plot holes are there? What doesn't make sense?
