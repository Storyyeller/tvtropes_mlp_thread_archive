            Celestia is usually shown making mistakes or being incapacitated because if she didn't,  she could solve the plot of most fics almost immediately. It's not bias,  it's necessity. Depending on the exact plot,  of course.

            @Death cloud. I can almost guarantee that a certain scene in chapter 10 (Or was it 9?) in Past Sins would send ginger foaming. If not for celestia then for Twilight.

            @Lurker ah,  but you rarely see stuff like that happen to Luna.
<p></p>In fact,  I almost started writing the Allspice story (CURSE my lack of writing chops) PURELY because I wanted to come up with a story where Tia was competent but that still had a believable threat.

            Which type of pony would I like to be?  Probably Pegasus,  since I've always wanted to be able to fly since I was little.  However,  I'm not so sure I would handle the more athletics-oriented pegasus society very well and would probably end up living in a place like Ponyville that has a mix of the different types of ponies.  So I'd be a pegasus,  but one who would be more like Fluttershy,  probably.

            @Ginger That's not the impression I got from it. In fact,  what contributed to making me quit the fic in the first place was how stupid Luna's whole plan of leadership was (i.e. she had none,  and dumped it on the even less qualified mane 6). Celestia stepping down was what ruined them.

            That's the issue. Celestia's a genius and is more powerful than Luna. Most fanfic authors have to keep her out of the way because she an solve the plot mpre easily than <em>they</em> can.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>Luna's just come out of her emo teen phase,  so it's easier to manipulate her.
<p></p>But not all fanfic author's hate Celestia. I <em>love</em> her. I just deal with stuff that she's too busy to deal with.
<p></p>And in the Lunaverse,  Corona curbstomps Luna (who is more powerful than canon!Luna) in about 3 seconds with pretty much no effort.

            Eh,  I prefer Luna. Not that Celestia is a bad charector,  far from it in fact,  it's just that Luna is more fun to write as well as watch IMO.

            I totally understand why Celestia stepped down. But yeah,  that's what caused everything dto go down the drain,  because Celestia was <em>far</em> more competant than Luna.
