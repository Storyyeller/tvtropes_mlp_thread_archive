            You could always do a soft split. Make different folders for tropes that apply to each individual book (and one for tropes for the series in general).

            I do not think the books warrant a page of their own.  That would be pushing it- this IS a Just For Fun page that is only inspired by one episode of a TV show.  That's why I thought making it too long and having too many sections would make a troper go "screw this,  I don't have time to understand all this stuff before adding my own!"

            K I just read through the Characters Page.
<p></p>Sirs and Ma'ams,  I don't know what to say.  We have expanded the universe of Daring Do way past anything I could imagine.  We should definitely find a way for <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaurenFaust" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaurenFaust">Lauren Faust</a> or the writers on the show to see this!

            well the writers most definitely will not look. It's a basic rule,  they can't look at any fannon creations to prevent any legal issue if they happen to use an idea similar to something a fan came up with.
<p></p>Now Ms. Faust on the other hand. Anyone want to put a link to it on her DA page?

            Well,  we could just link Faust on her DA.  Although we might want to get this rolling a bit more before we start vying for the creators' attention.
<p></p>EDIT: IIRC,  she was involved in all the episodes' pre-production stuff.  So there's a fairly good chance she'll know.

            ok after reading the Xanatos gambit entry,  I've got an idea for tweaking it.
<p></p>1. the "treasure" isn't put there by Ahuizotl it's part of the trial,  He simply removed any mention of it's abilities from the clues he left for the Do's
<p></p>2. Teleports and destroys? how does that work? I'm thinking it randomly teleports,  but the method it uses kills any living being caught in it,  inanimate items are fine.
<p></p>3. It really WAS a Xanatos Gambit because unbeknown to the Do's the "treasure" they thought was just a trap was actually part of the trials,  not the goal. It teleports the stuff effected to the location of the real treasure,  but only sufficiently powerful beings can survive. Ahuizotl knew he could survive the teleport,  but couldn't get to the item. The Do's getting killed would have just been a bonus.

            Has it all even been noted on Equestria Daily,  yet? It's a bit presumptuous to throw this at the show's creators,  I think,  if it's not even been acknowledged by the larger fandom.

<p></p>Seraphem: Hmm.  Well,  Ginger wrote that one.  Since it's so complicated,  I think I'd like to clarify the original intent before modifying it.  Although that tweak to the plot probably could work.

            So... by way of apology for an empty post,  my ideas for <em>The Wooden Mask</em> and <em>The Gardens of Equestria</em>:
<p></p>The Wooden Mask has an inscription on the inside that translates to,  "The masks we wear show our true face". It's a mask of shadows - the true self. It allows the wearer to see the true self of those it beholds in the form of shadows,  lurking behind them and speaking their thoughts at all times. However,  the more you wear the mask the more your own shadow comes out - you start to act on basic impulses,  losing you inhibitions. Once you're acting purely on your shadow it start to warp you,  turning you into a caricature of yourself and even corrupting your body to resemble the shadow. Eventually,  you become nothing more than a shadow yourself,  and burn away in the light - because while a show is what is behind the mask,  it is not the whole truth. It cannot exist without a mask to hide behind. The mask was created by a zebra priest at the command of a pony king who once conquered the marengeti in ancient times. He was commanded to create something that would allow the king to see any who opposed him. In the end,  the kind was his own greatest foe. He acted only out of his own selfishness,  with no regard for the rest of the world - no mask to hide his shadow. Though I may want to twist that to have something to do with the idea of The Gardens of Equestria...
<p></p>In The Gardens of Equestria,  there isn't any real treasure - the treasure is the gardens themselves. They're the fertile fields,  the origin of the earth pony tribe. Possibly the origin of all pony kind,  in fact. It's the wellspring from which all earth pony magic flows,  the source of all earthly magic. The Gardener is a massive,  immortal earth pony,  with flesh like solid stone - Daring thinks he's a statue at first. He was the first acolyte of king steady,  the first Earth Pony King. He charged the gardener with protecting the secrets of the garden before he died. The Garden of Equestria would theoretically be the first notion of a larger plot involving the four tribes and their kings - and the artifacts of their kings. Running with the idea I had before where each of the artifacts has a power and belonged to one of the four kings. Each of them would have their own home,  I suppose. I'd give my opinion,  but other people have claim and I don't want to tread on any toes. But anyways,  yeah. The Gardens of Equestria are the home of the earth ponies,  and the source of all earth magic. In fact the earth magic is so strong it interferes with other magic - including Do's ability to fly.
