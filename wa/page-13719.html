            Does anyone know Echo's eye color? I'm trying to find as many details as I can about her. After reading through her blog I might just write a fanfic. At the very least I could put a bit of realism in her character and won't have to worry about visual description all that much.

            I can't remember Echo's eye colour. I did like what I've seen of her blog,  though I did think it was weird that the fastest Wonderbolt was using echolocation. How in Equestria is it supposed to work properly at that speed? Oh well.

            Perhaps her echos can bounce off clouds? I've always thought that pegasi have an innate sensitivity to air currents,  Echo probably just relies on it more than most.

            The artist for <a class="urllink" href="http://derpibooru.org/254016">Ask Echo Fleetfoot<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> draws her with light green eyes with no pupils (a quick google search seems to suggest green eyes have spread to other fanart for Fleetfoot even if they don't go with the "blind eyes" thing). She has a blue coat and a white mane/tail with a light blue streak in it. She has no canon cutie mark (Fleetfoot has never been seen outside her flight suit),  but the artist for Ask Echo gives her sound waves ("echoes").
<p></p>Hope that helps!

<p></p>I'm pretty sure that the quotes from the show demonstrate that <em>the writers</em> consider other pegasi to be supersonic.
<p></p>But whatevs.
<p></p>Still weird with the crazy doppler effect.
<p></p>Anyway,  I looked up her blog again. Her eyes look turquoise to me.

            I don't think any actual speeds have ever been confirmed.  We can just chalk up any discrepancies to magic.
<p></p>Also,  I think the reason alicorn Twilight didn't obliterate the fandom is that they announced it two weeks ahead of time,  which gave everybody the time to adjust to the idea.  If it had been a twist at the end of the season,  we'd probably still be freaking out over it.

            Let's look at this quote from the show:
<p></p>Pinkie: A Sonic Rainboom is when a pegasus like Rainbow Dash gets going <em>so fast</em> that they create a rainbow and a sonic boom at the same time!
<p></p>Remember that Rainbow Dash,  the expert,  is there and doesn't contradict Pinkie. Nor does Twilight act suspicious of Pinkie's description despite her understanding of physics and magic.
<p></p>Now let's break up the quote:
<p></p>"a rainbow and a sonic boom at the same time"
<p></p>This is confirmation that sonic booms without rainbows <em>do</em> happen.
<p></p>"A pegasus like Rainbow Dash"
<p></p>This is confirmation that other pegasi can do it.
<p></p>"<em>so fast</em> that"
<p></p>This is confirmation that the only difference between the technique in creating a sonic boom and a Sonic Rainboom is that a Sonic Rainboom is faster.
<p></p>Combine this with the legendary status of the Sonic Rainboom and we learn that there are multiple pegasi who are fast enough to create a sonic boom,  but that Rainbow Dash is the first in what is probably centuries to be fast enough to create a Sonic Rainboom.
<p></p>This teels us that the difference in speed between a sonic boom and a Sonic Rainboom is <em>large</em>.
<p></p>Which is all exactly what the animation tells us.

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Well there isn't much to crash into in the areas where they would be flying anyway. </div>

<p></p>Oh no,  Princess Luna is back after a year-long absence! With a redesign!

<p></p>What's this,  they're adding a pink girly princess out of nowhere? A <em>third</em> alicorn! She's a blatant toy ad! She'll be a terrible character!...Nope,  Princess Cadance is quite likable,  she has a lovely singing voice!
<p></p>Bah,  they're making Twilight a princess!

            <div class="quoteblock">Also,  I think the reason alicorn Twilight didn't obliterate the fandom is that they announced it two weeks ahead of time,  which gave everybody the time to adjust to the idea. If it had been a twist at the end of the season,  we'd probably still be freaking out over it. </div>
<p></p>I agree. Most of the rage happened when it was first announced.

            <div class="quoteblock">Bah,  they're making Twilight a princess! They're ruining her character!...Nope,  "Princess" basically means "Prime" in Equestria,  and our Twilight is still as Adorkable as ever. </div>
<p></p>I never suspected that they would do something as awful as take away Twilight's adorkability. My issues with Princess Twilight are:
<p></p>1. It alters her relationships with her friends.
<p></p>2. It allows her to do things she previously needed her friends' help for.
<p></p>3. It isn't what Twilight was aiming for.
<p></p>4. Her friends were snubbed.
<p></p>5. It's taking her in the direction of becoming an ideal rather than an identifiable role model.
<p></p>6. I don't like the implication that there was something wrong with Twilight and they had to "fix" her by giving her wings.
<p></p>7. I don't like anything that encourages people to think: Alicorn &gt; unicorn &gt; pegasus &gt; earth pony.

They dissed mah boi Star Swirl!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue"> (Yeah,  this is mostly projecting because I based the relatoionship  between my mane character and Star Swirl the Bearded in my fic on the relationship between myself and my father (admittedly loosely))

<p></p>True. But I generally accept what a character tells us about worldbuilding as fact unless I have reason to doubt.
<p></p>Admittedly,  it's not a perfect system,  for example,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word Of God</a> has confirmed that in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/CRISISEquestria" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/CRISISEquestria">CRISIS Equestria</a>,  nopony knows what they are talking about,  which is just part of the fun,  but generally it serves pretty well.

            @Sereg Nothing in Pinkie's quote indicates that sonic booms are at all a common occurrence. Considering the low flybys that fast pegasi make quite often,  we can conclude that they most certainly are not common,  even when said pegasi are straining themselves (Hurricane Fluttershy,  Secret of My Excess,  Wonderbolts Academy,  Games Ponies Play,  etc.)
<p></p>It's still all up to interpretation,  but you can't say that things are common and canon when I can just as easily bring up contradictory information. Headcanon remains headcanon.

            @Perpetual: There's also the fact that Pinkie is in full fangirl mode when she makes the claim and that Dash's mind is clearly elsewhere.
<p></p>Let's see here:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">1. It alters her relationships with her friends.
<p></p>2. It allows her to do things she previously needed her friends' help for.
<p></p>3. It isn't what Twilight was aiming for.
<p></p>4. Her friends were snubbed.
<p></p>5. It's taking her in the direction of becoming an ideal rather than an identifiable role model.
<p></p>6. I don't like the implication that there was something wrong with Twilight and they had to "fix" her by giving her wings.
<p></p>7. I don't like anything that encourages people to think: Alicorn &gt; unicorn &gt; pegasus &gt; earth pony.
</div>
<p></p>1. We don't really know how much it's going to change her relationships with her friends.  Their personalities are unchanged,  so while she fills a different role,  it doesn't necessarily means that everything that's already been established gets thrown out the window.
<p></p>2. Not necessarily; the vast majority of Twilight's shortcomings are personality based and social; stuff like freaking out easily,  not being able to read other ponies,  etc. I can't imagine that Twilight has <em>completely</em> gotten over her Adorkable qualities.
<p></p>3. I'll give you this one; it is pretty weird that they stick her into that position so quick. The consolation is that at the end of the episode she seems totally okay with it,  so it isn't like they're forcing her into something she doesn't want.
<p></p>4. Um... they aren't,  really.  Twilight gives them the credit for where she is now,  and they're with her for the whole thing. They get plenty of recognition. If you're talking about how they didn't get to ascend,  I feel compelled to point out that even in the <em>pilot</em> Twilight was the special one of the group.
<p></p>5. I can understand the concern here,  but I think that's another hypothetical thing. She's taken a <em>step</em> towards being like Celestia,  but she's <em>far</em> from being there. It's actually a good opportunity for some plots about dealing with responsibility.
<p></p>6. I'm not seeing that implication.  They gave her a bonus,  but there's no implication that there was anything wrong with her.  If anything it's more a case of the wings being a symbol or reward for her accomplishments.  I.e. "You've accomplished X and you're getting wings for it".
<p></p>7. It does imply alicorn&gt;other pony races,  but that's been in place from day one. Not sure how it says anything about the relationships between the other races.
