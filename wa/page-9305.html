            @Turtle: But still,  bronyism only involves "I like this show" and doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the fact that it's about animals.  I like the show because I like the characters and the writing; they fact that animals are involved is entirely coincidental. Yeah,  there's overlap,  but I'm pretty sure that a <em>lot</em> of MLP's popularity doesn't have anything to do with the fact that it's about ponies.
<p></p>@Kyler: Awesome.

            Bronies/furries are in no way mutually exclusive,  so I don't see what the big deal is. The main difference is that bronies are a fandom of a specific show,  and are in it for the characters/world for the most part,  while furries are not attached to any particular fandom,  and are instead in it because of interest (of varying degrees) in anthropomorphic characters.

            @Perpetual: that's pretty much it.  They aren't mutually exclusive,  but on the other hand being a fan of MLP doesn't make you a furry either.

            I wonder if the pony fandom's become big enough that there are people who consider themselves bronies purely on the basis of fanworks? (Kind of like how there are Touhou fans who've never even touched the games.)

            I think it's more that some bronies don't like being lumped in as furries because a lot of them aren't,  and some furries think that all bronies are furries in denial or something.  I really don't know; I don't really interact with the furry fandom that much.

            My boyfriend almost falls into the Brony by Fandom category.  He's hardly ever seen the show but he looks at fanart all the time,  and is building a website thats sort of like a Derpibooru for videos.  He doesnt do fanfics though.
<p></p>I think he just likes the creativity of the community (he's Ex furry too... I think he misses some of the creativity of Furry community before it went down the tube)

            @Kyler Touhou can work that way because 90% of the plot/characterization comes from fanworks and supplementary materials thanks to the nature of the source games. FiM is a plot/character driven work,  so it can't really attract that kind of periphery fandom.

            @ Turtle,  you relize that all but oe or two tings on that list petain to EVERY fandom ever right? And the large amount of non-hetero line is an asspull. Pretty much every survey,  census,  study etc.. has come out with the Brony community onyl having a slightly larger % of gay/bi/anything else people then average like single digit percentage over average.

            @Perpetual: I don't know; the background ponies develop almost exactly in the same fashion as the Touhou fandom does things.  Whole characters build off of single scenes and animation errors?  That's definitely Touhou-esque.  Stuff like Lyra's human obsession being based off one shot,  for instance.
<p></p>And yeah,  just about every wide-range survey has come up with the MLP fanbase being predominantly straight; it's just that the LGBT parts of the fandom tend to be more vocal about their orientations.  As for shipping stuff,  that happens in <em>every</em> fandom.  The predominance of lesbian shipping is due to the fact that most of the characters are female,  and most of the bronies are straight men.
<p></p>As for the other stuff,  yeah,  a <em>lot</em> of it fits many fandoms.  I mean "they both have meet ups"?  <em>Lots</em> of fandoms have meet ups.  Civil war buffs probably have conventions.  Yeah,  there are similarities,  but I don't think bronies are any more similar to furries than they are to Trekkies or Touhou fans.

            @JT Oh,  I know. <em>That</em> is very similar to Touhou,  but we're talking about people heavily involved in the fandom who are not fans of the source material,  but the fandom itself. I'm sure there are some bronies out there like that,  but Touhou is much more conducive to that type of fandom given its nature.
