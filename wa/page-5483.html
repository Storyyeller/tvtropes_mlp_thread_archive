<p></p>I sort of felt that It's About Time missed a chance to partner up Twi and AJ for the episode.  Twilight's insanity would have played off nicely against Applejack's common sense and laid back nature.  Particularly since Spike seemed to abandon his <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> role for that episode.  But instead they threw in Pinkie,  adding more crazy to the mix.  Granted,  it was kind of interesting seeing Pinkie as the <em>least</em> crazy pony in the room.

            @Moe If you say so. She's pretty much <em>always</em> been that way though,  at least in my mind. I don't see why it has suddenly become a problem now. Heck,  just look at her <em>very first appearance in the show</em> for a great example of that exact style of comedy.

<p></p>Oh she's had two episodes... but they weren't ABOUT her... not really.
<p></p>In TLR she was missing for a while and she wasn't the POV character. The ep was about the group's efforts to best AJ. (which they did) plus she was overshadowed by Derpy

<p></p>My anon senses are singing,  I sense that poor Blossomforth is going to find herself the unfortunate target of some rule34 exploiting her flexibility.
<p></p>AJ is best tsukkomi after Twi,  so she needs some boke like Dashie or Pinkie to bounce off her solid character.

            The <em>antagonist</em>? Maybe,  in a sense,  but she was also the main character of the episode. Her conflict was with herself.
<p></p>Kind of a shame that the show's atmosphere needs to be mostly rainbows and sunshine. It would have been nice to have Applejack grapple with the issue of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a>.

            I also know that Phoe of Equestria Daily has a ponysona that resembles one of the toyline pegasi in colour scheme.
<p></p>My own wmg concerning <em>It's about Time</em> is that there was an original timeline buried somewhere wherein everything that could have gone wrong went wrong (dam breaking,  monster escaping Tartarus because Cerebrus is being naughty and not doing his job),  and Twi's injuries were caused by whatever happened then. In subsequent time lines,  she resolves the problems before they start and gets injured in identical fashion through less perilous accidents because narrative and quantum inertia demands it,  also she always winds up visiting a past self to warn her about something.

            Pinkie's very first appearance was innocently walking up to Twilight,  then inexplicably gasping and dashing off when Twi talks to her—and we don't get an explanation (or even see her again) for pretty much the rest of the episode.  The focus is on Twi throughout,  and Pinkie's not interrupting the plot—in fact,  she's adding to it,  since the plot at this point is about Twi's difficulty at making friends and this gag feeds into that.
<p></p>But "a cerberus attacks,  so suddenly we have this sketch where Pinkie calmly walks to the center of the screen then suddenly goes into panic mode?"  That's not supporting the plot or giving the others something to play off of in any way.  It's just an empty gag,  existing only so Pinkie can do something funny.  Being wacky may be her thing,  but that doesn't mean you can just throw one in whenever you want with absolutely no consideration.

            @Moe Dantes: I can totally see where you're coming from,  but for some reason A Friend In Deed had the opposite effect on me.  When they turned Pinkie up to the most ridiculous,  blatantly annoying level they could,  I found myself actually liking her.

            @Kyler: She was supposed to be annoying "in the episode" not annoying to the fans.  Although my issue was more that she invaded Cranky's privacy so often that he was pretty much entirely justified in wanting nothing to do with her.

            I didn't mean I thought she was annoying <em>personally</em>,  more like I heavily empathized with Cranky.
<p></p>I wouldn't want a stranger outright rummaging through my stuff either. I'm already reluctant to let <em>friends</em> touch my stuff.
