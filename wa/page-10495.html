"Applebuck Season" was episode 4. "Winter Wrap Up" was episode 11. "Fall Weather Friends" was episode 13. Either an entire year passed between episodes 4 and 13,  or events were depicted out of order.

Filly Rainbow Dash raced to defend filly Fluttershy's honor.
<p></p>I just remembered. In "Griffon the Brush Off",  Pinkie was acquainted enough with Fluttershy to know that pranking her was going too far. Yet Rainbow Dash was apparently okay with pranking Fluttershy,  and had to be restrained by Pinkie. Hmm.

I don't get the impression that they were anymore then distant acquaintances in school.

<p></p>I don't know... I feel like,  of the lot of them,  Fluttershy and Rarity were the closest before they met Twilight.  Their spa date thing sounds long-running to me.

Moiraillegiance. It's a form of alien romance from <em>Homestuck</em>. Rather than sex or procreation,  it involves sharing all your feelings with your partner. Typically it pairs someone strong and aggressive with someone weaker and level-headed. The level-headed one acts as a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain">Morality Chain</a> on the aggressive one,  holding their destructive tendencies in check. The aggressive one defends the level-headed one from the outside world while also encouraging them to be more assertive.
