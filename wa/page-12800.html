Yeah,  in <em>Inception</em> the whole point of inception is to plant an idea in someone else's head,  in such a way that they think they came up with it themselves.

            Of course,  just because what Luna did with Scootaloo doesn't count as inception doesn't mean she can't perform inception.  After all,  she doesn't need to come right up to the pony as herself and tell them they're dreaming.

            <div class="quoteblock">I must admit that this may be due to me being a fan of Ajimu. She's not the most powerful character in the Medaka Boxvere,  but she has just under 13 quadrillion powers. These include 1. Universal reality warping 2. time manipulation 3 rewriting history 4. effective omnipresence 5. nullifying other powers 6. the power to always be stronger than her enemy 7. the power to make people die by seeing her 8. the power to hurt all your loved ones as she hurts you 9. petrification... etc. IIRC,  we know about 700 of her powers so far.</div>
<p></p>See that's just silly. You really can't have a comepelling plot in a 'haxverse' unless you make up some BS reason why everyone fights eachother with danmakku instead of actually using their powers.

<p></p>This setting sound ridiculously broken.  How do you even set up a conflict against someone like that?
<p></p>Incidentally,  why is that Pinchy one wat coin image not in our repository?
