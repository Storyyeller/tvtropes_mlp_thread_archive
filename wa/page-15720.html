            If it were Diablo 3,  Twilight would be the wizard,  AJ the barbarian,  Dash the demon hunter,  Rarity the monk,  Pinkie the witch doctor,  and Fluttershy would be too scared of the opening cinematic to ever make it to character creation.
<p></p>If it were <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfWarcraft" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>,  Twilight would be a human arcane mage,  AJ a dwarf protection warrior,  Dash a troll enhancement shaman,  Rarity a draenei discipline priest,  Pinkie a gnome subtlety rogue,  and Fluttershy a night elf restoration druid.
<p></p>Also,  not quite the same thing,  but my current fantasy novel had its original genesis in an idea for a multiplayer Zelda title where players would control a party made up of a Link analogue,  a Sheikah sorcerer,  and a Gerudo thief. The Sheikah would substitute magic for Link's arsenal of tools and weapons,  and the Gerudo would play like the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinceOfPersia" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinceOfPersia">Prince of Persia</a>,  using acrobatics and parkour.

            Well,  she does have very high charisma and is known to break into random songs to get people's spirit's up,  so I think it counts. AJ would make a hilariously terrible rogue,  especially if she was caught and failed at lieing her way out.

            Good ol' thread hop time.
<p></p>@Irish's story:  Man,  the Dungeon Master in your campaign story was <em>mean</em> as heck.  I might have slight adversarial tendencies as a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonMaster" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonMaster">Dungeon Master</a>,  but I don't use them to try and make the players miserable for my own amusement.  Instead,  I use the bit of adversarial tendencies to provide a decent challenge.
<p></p>Anyways,  What would Octavia and Vinyl wind up if they decided to a D&amp;D campaign?

            There's probably a way to do it in 3.5e given it's sheer amount of splats,  but it's not easy. Bards have verbal components to nearly everything they do.

<p></p>It an be done. You just have to dance instead of sing. (or mime,  I guess. Or juggle. Or make silent puppet shows.)
<p></p>Now <em>that</em> would be an amusing character. A mute bard who gives his allies power by the power of how great his silent shadow-puppet shows are.
<p></p>I <em>so</em> need to add that as an NPC one day.
<p></p>Anyway,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendshipIsDragons" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendshipIsDragons">Friendship Is Dragons</a> actually has their classes down,  except if you're doing 3.5,  Beguiler fits Rarity better than Rogue.
<p></p>Big Mac is a Ranger with plants as a favoured enemy just like  his sister and grandmother.
<p></p>Rainbow might be a straight Barbarian,  but she might also multiclass as a Scout.
<p></p>Shining Armour is ... I was going to say a Warmage,  but they're more into evocation than abjuration and he's not a perfect fit for Duskblade either. So,  I guess he's an Abjurer who uses Still Spell to cast in armour.
<p></p>EDIT:<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Oh,  yeah! Bards can't use Silent Spell. Forgot that. So no spellcasting,  which gimps you. Still,  better than a <em>full</em> caster who doesn't cast.

            I looked it up and it apparently isn't that hard to have a mute bard. They can play an instrument,  tap dance,  etc. to use all their spells. Using their abilities silently is much harder since all bardic abilities must be audible. But the Subsonics feat from Complete Adventurer fixes that too.

            @Meta: Oh god,  that sounds nuts.
<p></p>The Star Wars system is,  I think,  pretty hilariously broken anyways. Buying individual skills is so cheap you can get up to 7 or 8 dice fairly quick,  which is about as many as you'll ever need,  unless you wanna start doing fancy shit(And even then. With 7 dice I once managed to get a roll so high I headshotted a guy so hardcore the shot ricocheted and headshotted ANOTHER guy).
<p></p>I could see Big Mac playing a defense oriented Paladin,  or Cavalier in Pathfinder. And yeah,  mute bards are simple,  since you can choose any kind of perform. My GM once told me about a game set in Feudal Japan,  where he played a <em>Kabuki</em> bard. He would have to do a set number of performances at the beginning of the day and then trigger them in battle,  I think. Though he could easily have done some kabuki dances in the field.
