            ...That could be good or bad.
<p></p>And that depends on the ratio of Fluttershy/Twilight/Rainbow singing to Pinkie singing.

            Hopefully most of them will be Pinkie's randomness and not poorly-written stuff.
<p></p>Either that,  or Ingram's other awesome musics are getting episodes crafted around them.

<p></p>I loved the fact that you quoted C's Lewis on your review I agree on most points specially the part that you spoke for the mane cast.

<p></p>Now,  this is something I've had running through my head ever since discovering the show,  and a topic that has occasionally cropped up in this thread: coming out of the "pony closet" to your friends and family. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad"> I'm now turning to you to maybe get some opinions,  if that's ok.
<p></p>I have yet not said a single word to any RL people about my burning passion for this show,  which has become part of my life by now; only on this thread,  which has helped a lot,  but not completely. It's becoming really unpleasant for me by now,  I can't clearly answer what I'm doing at the moment,  I can't quote anything or make meme references to it...
<p></p>Now my Dad's visiting the day after tomorrow and.. I really would like to "come out" at least to him. I distinctly remember one of our regular posters here having the same dilemma many,  many pages ago,  he ended up not doing it. If it helps,  my Dad is a super nice guy,  no obsession with "being manly" or anything like that,  and we share a couple of interests,  like Lord of the Rings.
<p></p>Really sorry for the wall of text there <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">. But maybe I'm not the only one with similar problems and we could get some nice conversation out of it <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">.

            I've come out of the closet to pretty much everyone. My mum likes the show (she even watches it with me sometimes),  My dad and I... have an understanding <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">,  my sis loves the show,  my friends tease me about it but admit that the show is pretty good despite themselves. My classmates have seen me on this forum. Most of them say something like: "My Little Pony?" but none have ridiculed me for it.
<p></p>saturdays have become pretty big around my house. and the new episode is pretty much on EVERYONE'S mind that day

            I've basically come out to all the people that matter. My sister is a fan but not as obsessed as me.
<p></p>My more jocky and manly best friend  on the west coast was already a fan of the show when I came out to him(I predicted it because he's so danged emotional.).
<p></p>I got another one of my friends into the show because I knew he would like it as a "sensy" as <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scrubs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scrubs">JD would call him</a>. I regret this decision because I forgot he had an obsessive personality.
<p></p>And my last good friend is just okay with it and is merely surprised at how big the show has gotten.
<p></p>No issues here.

Now,  the thing is,  the "coming out" part and explaining and so on is gonna be hard enough,  but then I of course would want to show a demonstration. That's the part that really gives me problems. I was thinking of maybe starting with the group picture to establish a basis and then maybe one the ponified movie trailers on Youtube to see it in movement... like this <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1hETuP33r8&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1hETuP33r8&amp;feature=related<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

            Augh. I just watched The Runaway Rainbow. Nothing is right. The entire plot revloves around rainbows,  yet they make it very clear that in this world rainbows only have four colours: Blue,  Pink,  Yellow,  Pink and Purple. Rarity is a pink filly with the attention span of a peanut,  Rainbow Dash is an Earth Pony who acts like Rarity and calls everyone "darling" as though she was Zha Zha Gabor and for some reason Cheerelie is a Unicron. For the sake of my sanity I will not discuss any of the songs.
<p></p>As bad as that was it still isn't the low point of the My Little Pony franchise. That would be this thing.

            Fell: The ponified movie trailors are generally a good way to start.  I started posting a few of them to Facebook and it piqued a few RL friends' interest (as well as some Internet friends').  Two of them ended up okay with it and have watched 7 or 8 episodes with me.  The third got quite a bit more into it,  although she's not as obsessed as I am.  It took kind of a two step thing to tell my family.  I started by showing them my customized Winter Wrap Up Twilight.  I don't think most of them took it as seriously as I thought,  though,  because for the second step where I wore one of my pony shirts when I went over for supper,  they seemed surprised.

            I've showed my parents a few of the episodes (they've both seen Suited For Success,  and my mom told me later that she's been in similar situations when it comes to web design) but they've never had a problem with any of my interests before (they've even watched <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuniPuniPoemi" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuniPuniPoemi">Puni Puni Poemi</a> with me,  AFTER I warned them what kind of anime it was first).

            My parents are probably aware that I like the show,  although I've never explained to them.  I have a Rainbow Dash bumper sticker on my car that I know they're aware of,  and I they've noticed when the blind bag toys I ordered off ebay came in the mail.  I certainly haven't made any effort to hide it.  The only reason I haven't bought a t-shirt yet is because I'm too cheap.
