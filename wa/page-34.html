            I know,  odd thing to say something about,  but I'm on the fence about the "scream" gag. I want to declare it a rehash of "yay!",  but it still amuses me and is so Fluttershy.
<p></p>I'm going to re-watch the episode later,  I like when Rarity gets time in the spotlight (seeing as how I see a bit of myself in her).

            Why all the irk over Twilight keeping her promise? On one hand,  the problem might have been solved if Twilight violated it,  but breaking promises isn't exactly healthy. If said promise breakage had worked,  then Twilight would have easily been forgiven by both parties,  but her word wouldn't be quite as trustworthy. Had she broken her promise only to make matters worse,  she would have had a serious problem on her hands,  <em>and</em> it would be unlikely for the others to seriously trust her again.
<p></p>Pinkie Pie was doing the right thing by encouraging Twilight to keep her promise,  though she was doing it in an unnecessarily harsh way (by adding "FOREVER" and such).
<p></p>If I were in Twilight's situation,  I wouldn't want to violate my promises,  even if doing so looked like a quick solution.

            ^and that's exactly what twilight was supposed to learn. "Don't break promises to friends,  even if it will fx their problems. Doing so only makes you look like an untrustworthy person,  and (as she said earlier in the episode) losing a friend's trust is the quickest way to lose a friend!"

            I have a problem with these absolutes. It would have been better if she had just told them straight off- she was in a position to help at any point,  but Pinkie was guilt-tripping her the entire way.

            Actually,  I thought that the intended point of the episode was to be honest with your friends...I think it was just that the composition of the plot was wrong. That's probably the wrong term,  but whatever.
<p></p>The whole thing would have been fine with me if Pinkie dropped her personal moral at the beginning,  as she did,  but rather than have her stalk Twilight to reinforce it,  they should have had Twilight debate whether or not to tell them herself,  like the adorable social retard that she is.

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I don't usually dwell too much on those types of issues—- I find if you apply too much logic to things,  you can miss out on a lot of fun ideas. Because we have the element of magic in the show,  I like to think that all sorts of biological and scientific things are sort of muddled up by it in a way that's accepted and/or understood by ponies,  but undefinable for us.
<p></p>It's like the Force,  in a weird sort of way—— I liked it when it was mysterious and undefinable. When they put midichlorians into the mix,  the Force was totally ruined for me. I want to know the Force is strong in someone because a powerful Jedi told me,  not because of a blood test!!! No fun!</div>

            So,  question for anyone who's actually familiar with the franchise,  as opposed to those of us (me) who just hopped on the bandwagon - how does this compare,  in quality,  to the other earlier series'?
<p></p>Because I'll never live it down if I like this and it turns out that consensus is it's not as good as the original,  because there is no way I'm ever watching the original.

Even the ones who appeared more frequently than others tended to be one-note.  They went on lots of adventures,  with <em>lots</em> of singing — and it wasn't as good as the self-aware singing we get in <em>FiM</em>.
<p></p>They also had humans in the original series,  with Megan as the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate">Audience Surrogate</a>,  plus her siblings.  It was also really obviously <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise Driven</a>,  as they made sure to include all the playsets,  and all the different types of ponies got spotlight episodes.  That was part of why few characters reappeared often; they wanted to fit in as many ponies as possible,  and remind viewers that the Big Brother Ponies/First Tooth Baby Ponies/Sparkle-eyed Ponies/Flutter Ponies/What-Have-You Ponies were out there.
<p></p>Then the second series,  <em>Tales</em>,  deep-sixed a lot of the fantasy elements and focused on a much smaller group of earth ponies.  There weren't any pegasai or unicorns this time around,  except for cameos as 'alien' ponies.  Really,  <em>Tales</em> could have been done with humans,  easily,  yet they tied it into My Little Ponies for some reason.  The cast got a <em>little</em> more depth,  but still weren't really rounded characters.
<p></p>Never saw any of the third generation stuff,  though,  so I can't help you there.

            Good to hear. The extent of my familiarity was the Nostalgia Chick's review of the movie,  which looked lame.
<p></p>And "Winter Wrap-Up" is stuck in my head. Seriously,  that's a really good song for something that appears in a kids' show.
