            Goodnight,  Sky.
<p></p>How on earth do you forget Hurricane Fluttershy?  I thought that was one of the best episodes!
<p></p>I think the ones I found most forgettable were MMDW,  Family Appreciation Day,  and May The Best Pet Win.  They aren't necessarily <em>terrible</em>,  just nothing really sticks out about them.

            The sun came up,  and she continued to sleep,  and she was still asleep by broad daylight. Now it came to pass that the prince who owned these woods was wandering in them. When he approached the tree,  he heard a loud snoring coming from it.
<p></p>The prince said to his guards. "See what kind of creature is hiding there."
<p></p>The guards followed his command,  and when they returned they said,  "A strange animal,  like none we have ever seen before,  is lying in the hollow tree. There are a thousand kinds of hair on its skin. It is just lying there asleep."
<p></p>The prince said,  "See if you can capture it alive,  then tie it onto the cart and bring it along."
<p></p>When the guards took hold of the mare,  she awoke. Filled with fear,  she cried out,  "I am a poor filly who has been abandoned by her father and mother. Have pity on me and take me with you."
<p></p>Then they said,  "All-Kinds-of-Hair,  you are good for the kitchen. Come with us. You can sweep up the ashes."

<p></p>Yeah,  the backlash is somewhat growing but,  most of the reviews are overwhelmingly positive. Checked out that link,  and yeah I disagree with his/her points. Though,  his/her complaints about the episode still falter in comparison to a <em>certain other fanfic writer's ones</em>... Ugh...

            Thus they set her on the cart and drove her home to the royal castle. There they showed her a little cubbyhole under the stairs,  where the light of day never entered,  and said,  "This is where you can live and sleep,  you strange little filly."

            As far as people being disappoint in the finale,  I say that 'tis unfortunate they can't just chill and enjoy the Love Love Tenkyoken.
<p></p>I would be immensely amused if somebrony did a full parody of the Sekiha Love-Love Tenkyoken,  only Luna replaces the King of Hearts with a mighty <strong>Huzzah!</strong>

            @ginger: The fanfic writer (the quite known one) I am referring to is Chatoyance. In particular <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/blog/23261">this blog entry<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Long story short,  she has a large beef against the majority of season 2. I know she added another blog post after that one but,  <em>ugh</em> it just reeks of detestation...

            Well,  the only thing that really stood out to me was the training montage. A lot of it probably has to do with me not being a big fan of Rainbow or Fluttershy. I'm not good at describing my reasons behind things like you are,  but I think I could say it was because the conflict felt a little overplayed a bit. I understand that Fluttershy is shy/weak, <span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> I can't even remember what it was exactly...</div></span> but she's been shown to be good at flying before. And even if they were isolated incidents,  0.5 was way too low to be reasonable to me. This is just going from my memory and the random notes I wrote down when I watched the episode.<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> I forgot I did that for most of the episodes.</div></span> <br> <br>Feel free to convince me otherwise. I have a feeling the episode's great,  my logic has holes,  and I just don't see it. <br> <br><div class="quoteblock"><strong>YEAH!!!</strong></div>
Also,  this. I can't stand this guy. He was annoying every time he showed up. <br> <br><div class="quoteblock">A shame,  since Secret of my Excess was one of my fav episodes this season</div>
But you forget,  I'm not a fan of Spike. He's one of your favorites.

            Yeah,  Dragon Quest wasn't that great either.
<p></p>As far as the finale goes,  I just want to point out that it's pretty much impossible to create anything that people won't complain about,  because ultimately a lot of the issues will boil down to "I didn't like this element",  so I'd take the criticisms with a grain of salt.  <em>Any</em> work will have issues if you look closely enough.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I think it's less about Fluttershy's physical ability,  and more about her overcoming her performance anxiety.  She had issues because she doesn't like being the center of attention,  not because she's physically incapable of helping.
<p></p>But yeah,  a lot of it boils down to "this episode wasn't about my favorite character,  so I didn't enjoy it as much".  I mean,  for all it's issues,  I really enjoyed "It's About Time".  It's hardly a great episode on the technical spectrum,  but I still had fun watching it.
