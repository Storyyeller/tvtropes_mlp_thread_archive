            <div class="quoteblock">As soon as I read about Faust leaving I immediatly had flashbacks to Gargoyles season 3. Some reasearch shows that the showrunner Greg Weisman was not the only person to leave at that time. Apparently the entire production staff was replaced and outsourced to someplace else. As long as we're keeping everyone else I think we'll be okay without Faust.</div>
<p></p>Faust is still involved,  though,  isn't she?  She's not completely abandoning ship,  she's just going to be <em>less</em> involved.

            Lauren being gone is strange. Derpy being a real character is also strange. In fact,  the idea of an antagonist is strange as well.
<p></p>I sincerely hope that they'll somehow make it work,  exactly because I'm not sure how they possibly could.
<p></p>That said,  new episode was pretty great. Had some real golden moments. I was also entertained by Fluttershy,  but the prospect of all sorts of "OH MAN SHE'S REALLY A MURDEROUS PSYCHOPATH" interpretations does not make me happy.

            From what I can tell,  Derpy's mostly just appearing in storyboards. So I think Kreoss meant that she's not a major character so to speak,  but they're intentionally sticking her in with the crossed eyes now.
<p></p>As for changed it now it sucks...well,  often shows can take more than one season to establish themselves. So maybe this season will be even better! Or is that beyond the impossible?

<p></p>No,  see...
<p></p>Rarity was just forgetting an idiom or something. You could have had a human saying,  "I'm wallowing in... whatever people are supposed to wallow in!" and it wouldn't be that strange.
<p></p>Goddammit,  now I'm forgetting what people are supposed to wallow in. How would one finish that phrase? Self-pity? Despair?
<p></p>After some Google searches,  I think the only idiomatic meaning the word can have is in "wallowing in the mire" and that basically means committing a crime.

            <strong>Fluttershy — Anger Management</strong>
<p></p>She's the sweet,  if timid pony that knows how to communicate with and handle animals of all shapes and sizes (unless they're a dragon)... but is she really all that gentle and kind under the surface?
<p></p>She has what is commonly referred to as "The Stare™",  which she claims to have no control over. It just... happens. And when it does,  whatever poor soul is on the receiving end is cowed into submission. At first glance,  would you think this pony capable of such intimidation? I certainly wouldn't. Yet here we are.
<p></p>So far,  it seems as if "The Stare™" only happens when Fluttershy is particularly <em>not</em> calm. Dragon throwing her friends around (and quite possibly about to turn them into barbecue),  cockatrice about to turn her three young charges into stone,  even just being frazzled by the chickens scattered and out of control <em>on top of</em> the Crusaders misbehaving.
<p></p>And then,  there's the recent look into the Grand Galloping Gala. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fluttershy is used to animals responding positively to her beckoning. So when all the little critters do the exact opposite? On the night that she was so worked up about? Her frustration rises to the surface,  and she flips the fricking-fricky-frick out.</span>
<p></p>What this points to,  I believe,  is that Fluttershy is hiding a different personality underneath that quiet exterior. To put it simply,  she has a bad temper. So how do you account for her gentle demeanor? She's using it as a defense mechanism. When she starts to feel angry,  when she start to feel like lashing out at someone else,  she forces herself to stay quiet,  to be as nice as possible to whoever she has to deal with.
<p></p>With animals,  her guard is a little bit lowered. I mean,  she can communicate with them,  but it's not quite the same as talking to another pony. So when dealing with animals (or otherwise non-pony lifeforms),  she finds it more tempting to give in to her anger and unleash it on the poor beast.
<p></p>Who knows,  maybe after all this time,  she's started to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">become the mask</a>. But the feelings are still there,  waiting for the next time she has to use "The Stare™".

<p></p>I was not aware I was reading the My Little Pony Alternate Interpretation Compendium,  is what I'm saying!
<p></p>Having read the post now,  I also have to disagree,  though! I don't like the idea that just because someone lost their temper once,  it means that they're actually violent and whatnot. There's the stare,  alright,  but I think that's just proving the point that even a nice and quiet person can be strong when they need to be. And it's not like you can get a much more pacifist "weapon" than a stare that basically just causes the opponent to stop fighting.

            I don't think you could describe a side of someone that comes out under stress as their "true" personality. It seems Fluttershy has been coming out of her shell,  but she's still a legitimately shy and gentle pony and she has a lot of trouble acting out on command in a normal setting. She couldn't give a good cheer until after the rainboom,  she couldn't tell off those bullies the same way she did the dragon,  and when she felt like screaming to get rid of the stress from modeling it was a pretty feeble cry. It's just that it's possible for the right amount of excitement and stress to break her out of her inhibitions.

            She does go into a kind of frustrated-Rarity voice (at least that's what I kind of <em>hear</em>),  which is odd because she isn't voiced by Rarity's VA,  but rather Pinkie's. I think that's what really drove it home for me though.

            I just see it as what happens to a genuinely timid/reserved person when you put them in a situation that not only carries a great deal of stress,  but also strips them of what they felt made them special. That would make anyone rage about.

            It really depends on the person. If it were me,  for example,  I'd tend to lock myself up in a room with a computer and internet. It takes a completely different situation to make me rage (and even then,  I have a pretty high rage threshold).

            I think such a situation would frustrate me to that point.

Not being able to get through to someone,  not to mention the only outlet I feel comfortable with (In this case,  cute little animals),  would definitely be a "AHJSJAHSJ WHY WON'T YOU GIVE ME CHANCE!?" occasion.
