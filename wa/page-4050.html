            I think I've come to a realization.
<p></p>I really don't dislike any of the episodes I've seen.
<p></p>But lately,  I'm having trouble appreciating them as much as I should be.
<p></p>And I think it's because all I can think about sometimes is how the thread is going to react,  and what kind of drama is going to erupt.
<p></p>Like,  I can't just watch an episode and see a conflict for,  say,  Applejack. I see the episode and worry about how I'm going to be able to help quell whatever arguments about relative power of the pony races arise. And I can't see a scene with Pinkie in it without worrying about if I'm going to be able to calm people down this time.
<p></p>It's a weird dilemma. And I can't just not come here,  because I love talking about the series with you guys,  all the same.
<p></p>It just kinda sucks having to worry about if I'm going to upset someone by saying,  for example,  that I really liked today's episode because,  contrived ending aside, ,  it did well at showing where both sides were coming from,  and stuff like that.
<p></p>I just want to enjoy it,  and for the rest of us to enjoy it,  I dunno.

            I haven't actually disliked an episode either. I actually enjoy debating in the thread,  though,  so possible controversy doesn't bother me much.

            I guess I don't have that problem. I usually worry about stuff like that after the fact. It's easier for me to turn that part of my brain off when it comes to ponies.
<p></p>Next episode should be less contentious.

<p></p>And I mean,  heck,  the episode ended pretty nicely,  to my standards (she managed to make him happy. Whether or not he used the word "friend" was irrelevant. I think he only said it to make her happy in return,  and then get some peace and quiet). I really need to stop worrying while I'm watching.
<p></p>Because,  when all is said and done,  I still really like this show,  and think it's written and delivered nicely,  and I <em>want</em> to enjoy it as much as I can.
<p></p>It's just... To call myself a "peacemaker" would sound kinda arrogant,  but that's the only term that springs to mind. I want to make sure that the people around here are happy,  you know? I worry about drama,  because I feel like it's my duty to quell it. I can't every well just sit by and not do anything,  right?

            Actually,  you know how I've said once or twice that a number of the main cast resonate with me in a kind of "I've <em>been</em> there" sort of way? I think I may have said that Pinkie never really hit that for me,  never really made herself all that relatable. But the song at the start of the episode,  well,  I think she finally struck a chord with me,  you know?

            If people are in the mood to take issue with an episode,  they will. It's not something I can control,  so I just let it go.
<p></p>I think about reactions more only when it's a Pinkie or Applejack episode. And only on this thread.
