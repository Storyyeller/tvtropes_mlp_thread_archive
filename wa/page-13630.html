            @JTeeth: That may be,  but Celestia explicitly conflates the Element of Magic with leadership,  and it's been the synthesis of the other five Elements since the pilot.  It just feels off to me,  that's all.

            ^^During her whole 'you've demonstrated all these qualities a Princess needs' speech - she mentions the other five Elements,  and then says 'leadership' when she turns to Twilight.
<p></p>Also,  didn't Magic show up when the other five were combined?  I thought that was the whole point of the 'mysterious sixth element'.

            Hm.. yeah,  I recall her talking about qualities they all had. But the only one I remember specifically was Applejack having "integrity",  which jives well with her actual episodes. What did she say for Rainbow Dash?
<p></p>Either way,  Twilight (who caused the Element to appear) described it as her knowing that she was happy to see her firends there,  and when Discord finally got to her,  she lost her colors  when she lost faith in her friends,  not by ceasing to care about leadership.

            @Red: That's true. The thing is,  I think that "Magic,  the element" is distinct from "unicorn magic". The Elements of Harmony aren't unicorn magic,  or any other type of pony magic; they're their own thing.  Basically,  you don't have to be a unicorn to be the element of magic.  The fact that Twilight is a unicorn magic prodigy could easily be a coincidence.  In context of the elements "Magic" is simply the ability to bring all the other elements together.  You don't need a unicorn to be able to do that.

            I think the elements were part of an experiment to contain the sort of magic that created the Heart of Fire that protected the founding fathers.
<p></p>But any attempts to contain that sort of magic into a gemstone,  even a flawless Fire Ruby,  caused the gems to break. So,  they distilled the force into six indivisible qualities that made up that power. Six elements,  if you will.

            I think that leadership is a quality of Twilight's,  rather than a quality of Magic's.
<p></p>Going on from that,  "Integrity" perfectly describes Applejack ("There's no point in winning if we cheat!"),  but to apply that to the Element of Honesty would require a bit of assuming and extrapolating.
<p></p>Extrapolating that I'm perfectly happy to do with the Elment of Honesty,  but I think that Leadership being Magic is too much of a stretch,  because the premise of its meaning from Episode 2 doesn't fit it at all.

            You know,  now I'm not really sure if the completed spell turned Twilight Sparkle into an alicorn <em>directly</em>,  or if it was Celestia that did that,  and the spell did something else?
<p></p>I'm going to really need to see the episode again.
