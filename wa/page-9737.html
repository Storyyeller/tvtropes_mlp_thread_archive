            Everything he does is Web based.  If I learn something its probably going to be for just web based stuff as well.  I have like zero ambition to do actual coding,  I just want to maybe make my website pretty if I ever get my home business off the ground.

            For as much as you bash it,  Story,  PHP isn't <em>broken</em>. Suboptimal,  maybe,  but the fact that 90% of the internet runs on it has to say something. The main thing it has on Python is that it's a C-based language,  meaning that its simply easier to use with,  port to and from,  and reconcile with most other popular programming languages. I hardly even had to learn anything to use it effectively,  and simple common sense and self policing can keep the nastier things that it will let you do that you shouldn't be doing from happening.
<p></p>Python is great,  yeah,  but web applications build off of eachother,  and the fact that most existing systems are in PHP means that using PHP saves time when extending,  modifying,  or otherwise working with them. Python needs a larger instal base before it becomes cost effective for popular use.

<p></p>I've worked with a much more knowledgeable programmer than me,  and even his PHP code had bugs,  bugs that wouldn't happen in any decent language. And this was with a framework and security patches.
<p></p>As for web development,  I've heard Ruby is good though I haven't tried it. Other possibilities are Node.js and Django.

            Also,  the reason Im looking into learning some sort of language is that Im going to get my Master's degree in Laboratory Information Systems once I finish my Bachelor's program.  I wanted to have a bit more computer background other than I can plug one in and make it do stuff.
<p></p>I guess Python would probably be the better thing for me to learn in that case?
<p></p>The last computer course I took was in 1995,  and was for Basic,  Lotus 123 and Word Perfect ... running from command lines on DOS.

<p></p>Only for really simple stuff. Try writing a loop that takes a callback which binds $this and you'll quickly see how much of a pain PHP is.

            What I mean is creating an anonymous function that has acess to $this. Trivial in other languages (that support closures),  but PHP arbitrarily forces you to copy $this to some other variable before you can do this.
