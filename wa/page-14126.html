            Well a good portion of the fandom loves anime as well,  and the show being translated for a Japanese audience is something that's interesting to them.
<p></p>Now what's all this I hear about the first episode being blocked?

            I love hearing my favorite shows dubbed in different languages,  even if it's not good. It's just so much fun to hear how other people interpret a character.
<p></p>I've noticed that a lot of Japanese companies are pretty quick with the ban-hammer with anime on youtube- so it might be whatever company/station has the dub that's blocking the videos. Or Hasbro doing it for them. If it's airing on one of the Japanese premium channels,  they might want limited access to the dub on the internet so people might be forced to upgrade to that channel/ buy DVDs.

            The deal with the blocks is basically this (to my understanding at least):
<p></p>Whatever company is airing the show basically has exclusive rights to airing the show in Japan,  and it's up to them whether they want to quash youtube uploads or not.  Hasbro and the Hub likely don't have much of anything to do with it.  It's unfortunate,  but chances are they want to keep it as exclusive as possible so that they can maximize their profit margin.

            @Sereg Nothing that hasn't already been implied by the flashback in A Canterlot Wedding. It does indirectly explore a bit of the ramifications of her becoming a princess at such a young age and what that means for her character,  though.
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As a princess,  Candace was almost constantly approached with problems and issues that ponies wanted her help with,  and she spent much of her time using her skills and magic to solve conflicts and help other ponies find love. Being so young,  though,  she was constantly told how great of a princess she <em>would</em> be,  rather than what she <em>was</em>,  and she never felt like a true leader. Eventually,  she realized that she was constantly being led around herself,  being given problems to solve or ponies to find love for and always deferring to the suggestions and commands of others. She had never sought out things that <em>she</em> wanted to fix,  and never sought out <em>her own</em> love. She realized that in order to be a leader,  she had to listen to her own heart,  not just the hearts of others.</span>

            Just going to note that talking about Perfectly Legal Means like torrents for finding otherwise blocked content on the forums is generally frowned upon.  You should really restrict that discussion to PM.
