Read as a poem (that hardly even rhymes),  it sounds something like "we can succeed individually,  but together,  we are even greater than the sum of ourselves". Like,  it's referencing the power of cooperation and team effort.

            So,  yet another once promising tumblr,  seldom updated of late,  has announced an apparently permanent hiatus.  Not before taking one last editorial swipe at Alicorn Twilight,  though.
<p></p>Hint:  I followed your tumblr to be entertained,  <em>not</em> to listen to you bitch and moan.  Since you whine that you've received "tons" of hate mail,  it would seem I'm not alone in feeling this way.  Yet,  you just kept it up. Please follow your own advice and "get away from ponies for a while."
<p></p>Oh,  well. *Syd removes yet another tumblr from his bookmarks*

            @Kyler; Are you saying the complete spell is saying that.... friendship is...<em>magic</em>?
<p></p>@Syd; You're not talking about Sketchy Twilight,  are you? I recall seeing they didn't like Alicorn Twilight. That was pretty much <em>the</em> most popular Twilight blog back during Season 2. Oh well,  they never update anymore...
<p></p>Every artist in the fandom needs to be like Ego or Madmax and just embrace pretty pony princesses like they're the best thing since cheese.

            Are there seriously people rage quitting the fandom over this?  What the crap.  I wasn't crazy about the Twilicorn thing at first either,  but I don't think they botched the execution and I'm eager to see where they go with it.  Some folks need to chill out.

            The meaning of the spell,  taken as a moral,  makes sense,  but it's harder to figure out what it's trying to do as a spell.
<p></p>Perhaps the idea is to focus the power of each through the "marks of their destinies",  to create an extremely powerful force of magic.
<p></p>And since Twilight was wearing the Big Crown Thingy,  she got the full force of the new magic?

<p></p>The writer and editor claims that his artist has moved on to other things,  but neither of them are hiding their feelings toward Alicorn Twilight.
<p></p>Seriously,  anyone who's watched this show from the beginning should have at least suspected that the writers had big plans for their main protagonist.  She <em>is</em> (was?) Princess Celestia's personal student,  after all.

            Well,  it "singles out" one's destiny,  and combines the power of friends to bring it about with "Magic without end." If you think of the "marks of destiny" as the Elements of Harmony,  and the "without end" bit as "[the Element of] Magic without end, " it could easily parse as fulfilling the destiny of the Element of Magic's bearer via ascension.

I really hope we get a version with an isolated score somewhere down the line. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/minis/award_star_gold_3.png" alt="[awesome]" title="[awesome]" height="16" width="16">

            I want an FIM soundtrack release. With all the background music in it.
<p></p>Possibly as a Disc 2 thing,  with Disc 1 having all the songs.

Just found out she <a class="urllink" href="http://crenair.deviantart.com/art/The-new-girl-in-town-355158900">has fanart<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
<p></p>She was at the New York Toy Fair,  mostly overshadowed by all the Princess Twilight stuff and tons of fan-favorites getting toys now. She was among a group of toys featuring the Mane Six wearing masks,  and she has an interesting design for a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodCreatedCanonForeigner" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodCreatedCanonForeigner">God Created Canon Foreigner</a>. Some folks are speculating she's a Season 4 character of some sort.
<p></p>Also,  on a soundtrack. Hasbro could totally package a deluxe version of the soundtrack with an Octavia toy. They'd sell a toy <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMusic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMusic">Awesome Music</a> at the same time!

            One thing,  though,  unless the doll is shown from a different angle,  it's ambiguous as to whether she's an Earth pony or a unicorn,  although she has the slanted eyes that are common for unicorn dolls.  If she's an Earth pony,  it would be unlikely for her to be Shining Armor and Cadance's child,  although not impossible (like in Baby Cakes,  maybe one of them has an Earth pony grandparent or something).  I wouldn't be surprised if she was a new character in Season 4 in some role,  though.  Maybe she's foreign?

            If you look closely,  she has geometric eye reflections. Maybe she's a Crystal Pony?

            I was under the impression that Princess Skyla was Cadance and Shiny's daughter.  She's the right color for the pairing.  I don't know where you'd get an orange and red pony from those two (although who the heck knows what controls coat color amongst ponies.. )... colors do seem to run in families though.
