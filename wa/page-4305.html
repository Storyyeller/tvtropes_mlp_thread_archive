            Thanks for the welcome! :D
<p></p>So anyway,  about My Little Pony,  what do you guys think about the next episode?
<p></p>Fluttershy is one of my favorite characters,  and I'm wondering how they'll handle the episode without it becoming cliche.

            I have only ever once met a pet,  cat or dog or otherwise,  that didn't like me. It was a cat that had been abused by some guys,  so it pretty much hated the smell of man. It was fine with girls,  but a guy? Nopenopenope.
<p></p>All animals seem to like me. And I like all animals. Yes,  even cats. They're calm,  they're quiet,  they don't need constant attention,  but when they like you they're nice and very warm animals.

            she wasn't. yes she made mistakes,  but really once she stepped down she really didn't do much,  and her stepping down wasn't incompetent. And most of the things you think she is incompetent for are because she did not have information that only became clear in hindsight. Keep in mind the ponies were winning the war.

            @ilsemmer: Next episode is the Iron Will one right?  I don't really know what to expect,  the synopsis is very vague.  I kinda hope the point of it ends up being that Fluttershy was actually pretty badass all along and that she isn't nearly as weak as she thinks she is.  Also,  I hope Iron Will is a stallion,  we need more male characters.

            Since I guess we can't get off the topic of animals,  I will put my two cents in.
<p></p>I love dogs AND cats,  although I am more of a dog person. I've had bad experiences with small animals,  but not terrible,  and they fit in certain lifestyles. I ADORE large animals though. Especially cows,  horses (ponies!),  and pigs (they're super smart).

            Welcome,  fellow female fan. Does anyone here have ginger's questionnaire?
<p></p>As for the next episode,  I do hope they put a new spin on Fluttershy's shyness,  or at least add more dimensions to her.
<p></p>I hope that Iron Will is gloriously hammy like Luna,  but I won't be crushed if he's something else,  either.

            yeah I've pretty much given up on getting to in depth into guessing about the new episodes,  the synopses are always so vague that they never meet your ideas.
<p></p>but was glad the last episode had the exact morale I was hoping for.
<p></p>and holy shit,  made that whole post without a red squiggle,  that's a record for me
<p></p>also welcome to the herd,  keep in mind we tend to wander quite far afield at times.

            @Ginger Is it really a mistake if you are acting to the best of your knowledge? (Again,  feel free disregard everything I say as I know nothing about the situations you're talking about.)

            So,  I just now found out that they changed the scene with Derpy in The Last Roundup to remove her name and give her a more girl-like voice.
<p></p>I wouldn't be all that annoyed by it,  but the new lines just sound bad. Like,  even Rainbow Dash's lines. It's a completely different delivery and the lines just sound weird,  now.

            Ha ha. I am also a fan of Avatar the Last Airbender. I'm now used to wandering topics.
<p></p>And yes,  I always read the synopses and think "Oh,  I can see what the episode will be about." Except I'm surprised every time... Love you MLP
