            @Dark: As a religious person,  I apologize on behalf of their... annoyingness.  Even if they disagree with you,  they ought to respect your decisions.  No matter how much you disagree with someone there's no need to be rude about it.  The best thing to do in this case is be as patient and rational about the whole thing as you can be,  and just explain calmly that you have your reasons for what you believe and that you'd rather not be preached at.  If they demonstrate any degree of the respect for others that Christians are supposed to,  they should at least dial it back a bit.

            I personally am <em>not</em> much of a Christian really...  I feel for you that you got stuck with the devoted one,  and think avoiding the topic is probably the best idea too.  (Not much I <em>can</em> help with on the problem truth be told.  Personally,  I find myself without a religion that I like to follow.)

            Last year I got stuck with a roomate who had pretty much opposite political views as me,  and was pretty politicaly active. But as long as we didn't talk about it,  it was fine.

<p></p>I'm similar NES. I'm pretty skeptical of religion,  but if I ever found one that could work for me with a reasonable degree of proof that their teachings were true,  I'd join.

            Probably the most convincing Gods to ask me to convert are Kanako and Suwako,  because it's not every day that your deity of choice would be able to personally intervene in matters :V Too bad I don't live in Gensokyo and I prefer to keep my religious options open :V

The only salvation I could ever see if a truly massive amount of psychers were sacrificed at the same time his coffin was deactivated. Hopefully,  the power explosion boosted by the last millenia of sacrifice and prayer would be enough to get him to ascend to godhood.
