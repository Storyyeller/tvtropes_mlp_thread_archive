            @Orion: You <em>can</em> make a page on just about anything.  Whether it's a good idea or not is up to debate.  And yeah,  it's tough to find tropes for the thread as a whole unless we start troping the posters,  which could go bad rather quickly.

            Public transport around DC is actually fairly decent.  Although we still have hiccups.  I once had to wait about an hour to get catch a metrotrain during a snow storm.

            Shoulda seen me when I was younger; I was the penultimate shoplifter. Got a camera set up? I know the dead spaces. Got an overhead mirror? Again,  dead spaces. It was to the point where I could steal a coffee table book and leave no-one the wiser. I got <em>bored</em>.
<p></p>Of course when I say 'should have seen me' you wouldn't.

            @Fallen: Tell me about it; every time I take a subway into NYC,  one of the lines I need to use is out of commission for some reason.
<p></p>Incidentally,  I was just struck by some fridge logic regarding "Putting Your Hoof Down": What the crap did Fluttershy need the taxi for?  Ponyville is small enough that everything is within a ten minute walk.  She probably ended up paying for a ride that was only a minute or two shorter than it would have taken her otherwise.
<p></p>@Chada: Depending on where you live,  buses can be...less than ideal.  Like around here in winter,  homeless people often scrape up the cash for bus passes and just chill in there to get out of the cold.
