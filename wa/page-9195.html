            So,  in a couple months I'm planning to audition for <em>Assassins, </em> which is totally the best musical ever. Today at my voice lessons I went over two songs I could potentially use for the audition - <em>Unworthy of Your Love, </em> which is sung by Hinkley,  the guy who tried to assassinate president Reagan,  and <em>The Ballad of Booth, </em> sung by John Wilkes Booth,  the man who killed president Lincoln.
<p></p>It's kind of odd,  because I think Hinckley is the role I've got the best shot at - he isn't exactly a heavy acting role,  as he doesn't have a whole lot of lines outside of his one scene where he sings his song,  and the main focus is that he just has to have a very pretty voice,  whereas Booth is pretty much the lead and needs to cover a big dramatic range and be charismatic and stuff. I am not an experienced actor,  to presume I even qualify as an actor at all. And hey,  I'm a foreveralone loser,  Hinckley's a foreveralone loser,  it's a match. In addition,  <em>Unworthy Of Your Love</em> is a song I've sung before in performance.
<p></p>But on the other hand,  <em>The Ballad of Booth</em> is probably a generally better audition piece - it's dramatic and covers a two-octave range,  making it a better "show off" piece. In addition,  my voice teacher that it'd probably be a better piece to use.
<p></p>Anyway,  I'm gonna try to finish a chapter of my fanfic tonight.
<p></p>Oh,  and pagetopper,  sure.

            @ginger I was on the fence about Stark. On one hand,  he was the comic relief,  so he had most of the funny lines. On the other hand,  he was a massive douchenozzle.

            @ginger Even though I went to a small screening (only 2 or 3 other groups in there),  everyone laughed at every line of Stark's dialogue. It made me almost not enjoy the film.
<p></p>One thing that bothered me: why can't Loki tap him somewhere else? His sternum isn't anywhere near his heart anyway.
