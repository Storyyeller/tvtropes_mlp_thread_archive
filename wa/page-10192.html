            I have no idea how on earth such a game would work out. It sounds like "Trying Too Hard: The Game."
<p></p>Also,  are we talking about <em>Howl's Moving Castle</em>?

<p></p>That depends on the game. But new games done in the style of old ones are usually awesome.

<p></p>Everyone always has tons of ideas for games. The key thing is to think of games that you could actually make. For example,  I think <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Achron" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Achron">Achron</a> and Lemmings would make a really good crossover,  and I think I could actually make it if I ever got enough freetime and motivation.

            It's going okay,  Sky Strike.  We just had a confusing bunch of discussions that made my mind whirl,  and now we've got a forty-five-year-old pony who wants to start a video arcade.  In short,  kind of incomprehensible right now.

            @Gex: I'd like more variety in the level design,  myself.  Different aesthetics and different music.  And also making Rarity not a <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PalleteSwap" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PalleteSwap">Pallete Swap</a> of Twilight.
<p></p>Anyway,  my take on videogames in the show is that they do exist,  but only the really primitive arcade type things,  and they're more of a novelty than anything else.  They don't have any big Nintendo-esque vg superpowers.  Given that magic is the show's electricity stand in,  I think it's entirely plausible that somepony decided to make a game with it.

            @JT Yeah,  assuming that you can get an enchantment to operate on even the most simple binary logic,  you could theoretically program with magic,  though the fact that the ponies involved are limited in their ability to "compile" (comprehend) their enchantments,  that puts a pretty hard limit on the technology without physical hardware to back it up.
