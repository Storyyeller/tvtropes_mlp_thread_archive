            Sleepless in Ponyville is my number 1. The rest are all differing amounts of good,  but I didn't appreciate Wonderbolt Academy as much as some people did.

<p></p>@Japanese Teeth: Same. In hindsight,  it wasn't terrible but it didn't stick out and only badly enthasised AJ's waning character to me.

The problem was that most of the family just sort of acted mildly annoyed at worst rather than actually escalating the conflict by protesting.

            I´m not sure if it hits the bottom of my list but I´ll go with Sleepless as my least favourtie simply by that MASSIVE plot-hole that was Luna dream walker powers. Seriosuly it just ruined the character for me. Otherwise the episode was good.

Most of her antics were mildly befuddling at best and the final blow was more a decent plan ruined by an unfortunate coincidence than her own overzeal.

            How is Luna having dreamwalker powers a plot hole? I mean,  I can kinda understand not liking the character developing in that fashion,  but how is it inconsistent with anything we've seen so far? She's only shown up like five times,  and there was no reason for those powers to manifest in any of those instances.

            and like I said,  even the lowest ranked eps for me are still in the top half of eps overall,  they really have put a lot of effort into making sure the few eps we've given are epic. Sure not everyone likes everyone of them,  but pretty varied with it and all of them have some fans.

            Oh boy,  I was fearing this Noah Antwiller rant from me...
<p></p>Since I don´t want to start of fight or anyhting I´ll just point out the most obvious flaws I see.
<p></p>1- If she has the duty to guard dreams then where does that whole "jealous because the ponies sleep at her night" came from? She was visiting them on their dreams so of course they wouldn´t be looking at her stars,  what was she doing waking them up so they can look at the moon? No wonder they got mad at her.
<p></p>2- if she already have that duty why take it on her subjects? it makes no sense,  she is mad at them for the thing she has to do? They need to sleep and you´re guarding their dreams,  you know they are sleeping,  why are you mad?
<p></p>3- So Luna has super awesome i can enter your dream powers,  her sister has...a bird. Yeah,  that´s all she has. What the hell? Celestia does nothing other than sign papers and rise the sun? especially ridiculous since we know Celestia can also raise the moon (as all unicorns can) so Luna has that power too,  meaning Luna has 3 powers,  rasing the moon,  raising the sun and entering dreams! Tal about OP.
<p></p>4- While it was shown she can actually alter dreams she can obviously itneract with them so why don´t you go Freedy Krueger and conquer their dreams as Nightmare Moon? Way to waste your superpowers.
<p></p>5- It completely retcons the nightmare Moon things as I said in points 1 and 2,  she was jealous of her sister...why? She had obviosuly the better powers,  she was personally helping ponies which will obviosuly be thankful of her once they woke up so she had the entire kigndom at her disposal. It makes no sense!
<p></p>I´m sorry,  I know I´m overthinking this but man,  that was a massive mistake for the story. It created a giant plot-hole,  I even ask Meghan Mcarthy what the hell was the deal with Luna sudden magical powers becuause honestly I think they ruined the story.
<p></p>I know nobody else sees that but I do,  it was stupid.
<p></p>Man,  I let go a big one! My apologies for the rant but since you ask and I needed to say it. Like I said I´m the only one who has this problem but until the show explains how Luna became Nightmare Moon this is my Parallax,  the one retcon that makes no sense and ruined the story  for me. Ugh,  I hate this!

            Best Two Parters you say?
<p></p>4. A Canterlot Wedding (Part 1 [C-] and Part 2 [B-]) [Lets see forced two new characters? Check! Put n very little action except for Twilight going crazy for part one? Check. A washed out villain who never really came off as a threat even when defeating Celestia? Check. Twilight claiming to know Cadance but not even thinking for a second about an impostor which she should've thought up? Check. Setting the Mane Six up to be decoys to a Sue-ish character? Check. The checklist on how to make a bad episode is complete. But to it's credit the flashbacks were endearing, the action scenes were pretty good, and the end was fantastic]
<p></p>3. The Crystal Empire (Part 1 [A] and Part 2 [A-]) [Great world building, great songs, and the bit parts were good, but I wish Sombra had a little more motivation, Dashie wasn't a prick, and Shining Armor did more. This would've been second place if the second part had been a little better]
<p></p>2. The Pilot (Both Parts [A]) [Great character establishing, a little contrived but completely forgivable for a first run]
<p></p>1. Return of Harmony (Both Parts [A+] [Part 1 takes 3rd overall and Part 2 takes second overall]) [Lets see Discord was awesome, great breakdown for Twilight, hilarious dialogue, and the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> given to Pinkie might single-handedly be the best scene]

            1. The pilot (lots of Character Establishment and one of my first episodes).
<p></p>2. Return To Harmony (it had Discord,  which is a big point,  but it did drag a bit).
<p></p>3. Canterlot Wedding/Crystal Empire (okay plots but didn't quite hit the mark).

            @ Ales: 1, 2: Her complaint isn't that they sleep but that they sleep during the night. She'd prefer them to be nocturnal.
<p></p>3: Celestia isn't exactly featured a lot. It's unlikely we know the extent of her or Luna's powers. Incidentally Celestia has the Dark Magic from the Crystal Empire and the failsafe spell from Lesson Zero.
<p></p>4: She can't change dreams much. She can talk the resident but was quickly overpowered by a breeze in Scootaloo's.
<p></p>5: She was jealous of her sister because she was unappreciated and her night,  which is her primary duty,  was ignored.
