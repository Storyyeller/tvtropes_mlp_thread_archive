            Storyboarding is fun.
<p></p>I love how I managed to make the class on Storyboarding I took harder for everyone else by trying too hard. Did an animatic with voice acting,  next assignment,  <em>everybody</em> has to do voice acting!

            I've not really gotten why 80s have been praised so much I mean outside the obvious ones that I know about are Transformers,  Care Bears,  He-man and to a lesser extent My Little Pony. Though I didn't know the past shows,  I did see a fair amount of advertising for the older MLP shows even a strange Mcdonalds advert that I have just recalled just now that crossover with I think it was either Transformers Armarda,  Energon or Cybertron whichever Transformers anime was on at the time with by far the weirdest crossover with either G3 or G4 My Little Pony. Obviously they had boys representing the Transformers side and girls representing The My Little Pony side.

            Cartoons from the 80's tend to be praised for the same reason Ocarina of Time is considered the best <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoZ" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoZ">Lo Z</a> game by a lot of people: It was first. (Clarifying this before I go any further,  OOT was still a good game,  but not as good,  I feel,  as Wind Waker or Twilight Princess)
<p></p>The 80's was basically when animation for television,  or at least a series as opposed to a number of shorts,  became viable. Therefore,  animated series were a pretty novel concept and the first ones to garner any sort of following or commercial success were praised for starting a medium more than their own individual merits.
<p></p>Of course there's also the fact that many of the people 'in charge' of doing all the praising grew up with those cartoons,  and therefore aren't exactly unbiased...

            I've heard things about there being a deleted scene from some 80's cartoon/animated film where a drunken soldier from GI Joe would have met Firefly or Wind Whistler,  after which he promptly empties his bottle of booze.

            I always thought that the most 80s cartoons were never looked upon as much more then nostalgic joy rides. If anything 90s cartoons get significantly more hype and adoration (though that may be just generational shifts).

            And considering I was born in the 90s,  1993 to be precise,  I can't say much about 80s cartoons in general were a good thing or not and plus the library of 80s cartoons that I have watched is not that many I'm afraid and most of the cartoons that I have found on the interwebs is very obscure one hit wonders to me.

            @The trademark issue for G1 ponies a few pages back; I think the editor of the IDW comics said they can do cameos/references to G1 all they want,  which is why we got a cameo from Firefly (with Pinkie's hair style oddly enough) in the first issue and the Sunset Shimmer origin comic has Moondancer finally appear in the flesh (she was mentioned in the first episode,  remember?) with her G1 color scheme.
<p></p>I think its specifically the <em>toyline</em> that can't use G1 characters/names for whatever reason,  and thus they don't have prominent roles in the show/comics.
<p></p>Funny thing with Firefly is Hasbro does have the trademark for that... that is,  Firefly the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GIJoe" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GIJoe">G.I.

Hasbro kept the rights to a somewhat obscure Cobra mercenary (I wouldn't say Firefly is someone you think of when you mention GI Joe or Cobra),  but not the My Little Pony with the most <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">Wolverine Publicity</a> from the 80's?
