            @Ginger It's not that you're completely wrong,  it's just that there are nearly infinite ways to write a story,  and any of them could conceivably be done well. You're missing a huge chunk of the picture.

            @ Ginger..ummm no. you do NOT need a good or even A villian to tell a good story. Yes you need some form of conflict,  but that doesn't mean a villain.
<p></p>and I love the Mario games,  even the non-RPG's have some fun little plot points.

            @Moe,  Ginger: While it's certainly not a hard and fast rule,  it's not without merit. Any genre or story that has a specific villain,  the villain is often the impetus to the plot. Of course at the same time they can just as often be an obstacle for the protagonist's goal,  meaning the protagonist was the impetus and the antagonist isn't driving the plot.
<p></p>It doesn't make the villains less important,  but it's good to keep in mind that there are genres that can,  and often do,  do without.

            What drives a story isn't even conflict. It's <em>motive</em>. Someone has to want to do something,  and act upon it.

            @Ginger: I doubt he was talking to you specifically,  and even then he wasn't saying that villains are bad,  just that they aren't required.  Like I said before,  you need a conflict,  and a villain (or more broadly,  antagonist) is a common way of doing that.  But it's in no way necessary for a story to have a villain.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Yeah,  but if something isn't impeding that motivation in some way,  the story isn't going to be very interesting.

            Take Pokemon Red and Blue. It had Giovanni has the main antagonist yet the story didn't revolve around him. It revolved around you getting stronger and being the best.

            @Lurker I don't think I am. With the sole exception of this show,  and even this show has antagonists who are my favourite characters. and House (which again,  has antagonists) I have never been interested enough in a villainless work to rewatch it again after I've seen it.

            In fact,  I find the best stories to be about a <em>conflict</em> of motive. Not simply that one party wants something and the other wants them to not have it,  but each party wants something completely different and their motives mingle. I find it makes both parties the most dynamic,  and creates for some interesting plot threads.
