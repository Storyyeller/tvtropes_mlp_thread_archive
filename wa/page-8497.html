            I think my opinion on it can best be seen as: I agree with the equalists,  but not Amon. I understand why they're concerned and that they want equality,  but the method they're going about it is all off kilter. No good.

            I sympathize with the Equalists plenty,  I just don't think forcing away something that's a part of what makes people who they are is the right way to do it. They're right they deserve better,  but uh taking away a part of someone's spirit is not the answer.

            Thing is though Ginger,  look at how people who have lost their bending have reacted: Tahno looked like shit when Korra saw him again,  and Ozai could barely even <em>move</em> after he had his taken away. De-bending doesn't bring someone down to the level of a non-bender,  it drags them down to the ground. They're completely emptied out. That's doesn't solve anything,  because it makes the debent the weaker party now. It's like slaves overthrowing their masters,  only to enslave them. It's hypocritical and deplorable.
<p></p>Plus it's an impossible solution <em>anyways</em>,  because even non-benders must have some sort of bending gene in them. which means that somewhere down the line bending is going to crop up again.

            @Ginger: Well,  no.
<p></p>Yes,  the 'muggle' situation is bad,  but that doesn't make debending the solution. First of all because it doesn't <em>actually</em> solve anything; it's just petty revenge on the part of the equalists. Nor,  quite frankly,  would giving everyone the ability to bend solve anything,  because then more skilled benders would rise to the top,  and certain elements would be able to bully others anyways.
<p></p>Equality is not,  despite what some may think,  about making everybody the same. Consider racial equality,  or sexual equality. Do homosexuals in the states seek equality by desiring to be straight? no. They seek to be given the same rights and priveleges <em>despite</em> their differences. That is what the non-benders need.
<p></p>We've seen so far that the city council is made entirely of benders. The city police force is made entirely of benders. Presumably a significant portion of the public sector is comprised of benders. <em>this</em> is the problem,  and now with modern technology it <em>can</em> be stopped. Moreover though what non-benders need is <em>representation</em>. An equal number of seats on the council to voice their concerns as citizens,  and to be given equal consideration.

            <div class="quoteblock">Thing is though Ginger,  look at how people who have lost their bending have reacted: Tahno looked like shit when Korra saw him again,  and Ozai could barely even move after he had his taken away. De-bending doesn't bring someone down to the level of a non-bender,  it drags them down to the ground. They're completely emptied out. That's doesn't solve anything,  because it makes the debent the weaker party now. It's like slaves overthrowing their masters,  only to enslave them. It's hypocritical and deplorable.</div>
<p></p>I think of it this way: You have any talents? Something you're particularly good at? Say you play the piano,  or draw,  or sing,  or cook,  or you play sports or you swim well,  or anything. Something that you're good at,  and it defines you. Now imagine it being suddenly gone.
<p></p>And what if your talent or your hobby was your source of livelihood? What if it was the thing that brought you the most joy in life?
