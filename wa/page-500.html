            Normally self-fulfilling prophecy bugs me to but not this time thanks MST Mantra.  I'm happy with way how episode turn out,  there was big Hydra in climax,  Twilight was awesome there,  and her "transformation" into Rapidash was hilarious.

            Yeah,  I think Twilight's abilities come mainly from her intense studying. She started studying and practicing magic long before the Rainboom incident.

            I was actually referring to Pinkie's attitude; the dogmatic thing was that everybody but Twilight just accepted the Pinkie Sense,  and the implied moral was that Twilight should have just believed in the Pinkie Sense from the beginning rather than try to analyze it or gather evidence.
<p></p>I don't think that's the message that the episode was going for (the problem wasn't Twilight trying to figure out what was happening,  it was her "I know I'm right and I'm going to prove it" attitude),  but it's easy to understand how it could be misinterpreted.

            In Feeling Pinkie Keen,  Twilight repeatedly stated that "there's no point in believing in something you can't see for yourself".  That is <em>skepticism</em>,  not <em>dogma</em>.  It was Bridle Gossip that contained the dogmatic belief that "unicorn magic is the only real magic",  which was really only a counter to the town's own dogmatic belief in Zecora's supposed evil magic.

And that wasn't accepted by TS because it was against stuff what she learned about magic.
And what  I saw moral was clear that TS should not be so stuborn about Pinkie Sense and accept this when she saw i hapen.
<p></p>I really hate whent people turn this episode into some kind of anty ateist propaganda.

            @Fallen Legend:  You're crazy,  Twilight is prettiest pony.  Anyone who tells you different is full of filthy lies.
<p></p>I think we're all missing the real point of Feeling Pinkie Keen,  which is that if you can annoy a unicorn enough they self-combust.

If another pony appeared,  one who'd trained just as hard as Twilight did,  then she still wouldn't be as powerful as Twilight. That's what I normally have an issue with. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift">The Gift</a>

Most unicorns probably only study magic that is related to their own interests,  taking an interest in magic itself probably isn't as common.  Until we see another unicorn who's special talent is magic,  we can't really know how Twilight compares.

If Twilight was constantly curb stomping Big Bads,  then it would be an issue,  but having the most potent magic evar isn't really relevant to throwing a great sleepover.
<p></p>And we don't know someone like that would lose to Twi,  because we haven't met anyone like that.

<p></p>@Death Cloud: I know that,  I was just explaining how a lot of people reacted.  I agree with your take on it; the point was that Twilight's friends had known about it,  and she should have trusted them rather than disbelieving all of them.

            Twiligth is student of Physical God,  I don't see problem with her being so powerfull.  And everypony in Mane Cast have some Gift. Pinkie Sense (if they ever use it again) or even those "Reality Warper Powers" ,  we saw what thinks Sonic Rainboom can cause,  Fluteshy have suck gift with creatures that she can beat monsters just by staring at them.   Maybe even AJ and Rarity have something similar what we still don't see for now.  Not mention Element of Harmony (I give it power one killoton of Care Bear Stare :P). So TS being most powerfull unicorn feet here perfectly.

            Just because it isn't the main point of the show doesn't mean that it influences Twilight's character; it creates a contrast between her expertise in her area of specialty and her inability to cope when she's in situations that don't involve it.  It's a pretty important part of her character that she's very book smart,  but socially stunted as a result.  She's very good at magic,  but not very good at anything else,  and the series is based around that dichotomy and how she reacts to it.
<p></p>EDIT: @Kyler: I'm also curious about that.  I don't think there's been any indication in series of how attractive the ponies are supposed to be outside of Rarity being the stereotypically beautiful one.

It's specifically making her THE BEST,  it means that the existence of a character better than Twilight is nigh impossible,  and there may come times when you need to use Ass Pulls to explain why Twilight can't use magic to solve a situation,  (yes I know most of the issues aren't solved by magic,  but I meant for the few that can)
