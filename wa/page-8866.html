            That was my other thought. Not sure if I'd be up to doing it,  though. I'd want to be sure I could do it justice.
<p></p>Like,  would it start in the middle of things,  with Twilight's idea of the campaign already in progress,  and then abruptly cutting to the real world when Rainbow Dash does something off the rails?

<p></p>nope,  can't fool RD.
<p></p>huh,  looks like RD has picked up some manipulation skills from rarity.
<p></p>oh man,  flutershy is having a PTSD episode.
<p></p>a badger!
<p></p>alright,  montage time!
<p></p>well these are the best woodland critters ever.
<p></p>wait...they were going for 10 wingpower per...wanted to break 1k...lost 8 ponies and now they may not break 800? Well that doesn't add up.
<p></p>one moment spike is getting slammed up against the measuring thing,  the nest moment him and twi are jumping up and down with no problems. Consistency!
<p></p>and where did spike get a double ended flute from!?
<p></p>well,  I enjoyed that episode quite a bit.

<p></p>So,  for the ponified tabletop RPG,  what would the non-pony playable races be? Zebras and buffalos instead of elves and dwarves?

There actually are like two or three different people working on a pony rpg here,  and I believe there's a play-by-post one going on in the forum rpg section.  I haven't checked on it in a long time though,  I have my own (non-pony) game to work on.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Rather than divide it into pony and non-pony races,  I think the main races should just be Earth Ponies,  Pegasi,  and Unicorns.  Maybe through in dragons too,  though it'd have to be young dragons for balance purposes.</span>

I wonder how one would get around the fact that all magic classes (Wizards,  Clerics,  etc) would have to be played by Unicorns or the like? It's not a problem in DND,  where <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrIsIt" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrIsIt">nobody in real life can use magic</a>,  so might as well just give it to everyone. In Equestria,  it's known who can use magic and who can't.

I've seen Roid Rage and Big <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLargehuge" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLargehuge">Mc Largehuge</a>. Apparently,  a lot of people call him Snowflake,  too. <br>Rant time. Not a fan of Hurricane Fluttershy. The only scene that really stood out to me was the training montage. Everything else was just kind of meh. It mostly has to do with Fluttershy and Rainbow being my least favorite of the mane six,  so it's just me.

            Welcome aboard,  Meta.
<p></p>For the record we do have a pony RPG set up. theo nly playable races are the three tribes,  though,  since the vast majority of the skills are built around racial basics(ie flight,  toughness,  magic),  though there are race-neutral spells.
<p></p>Mostly it's just because the skill list is very basic at the moment,  so the basics are the easiest to come up with.

<p></p>when RD gave up trying to convince flutershy and was leaving,  that was totally an intentional ploy on <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RDs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RDs">R Ds</a> part. That's how I saw it anyway.

            I don't think it was a ploy at all.
<p></p>At least,  I don't want to <em>think</em> that Rainbow was <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">intentionally using her (potentially BEST) friend's fragile emotional state in such a way</a>. It just doesn't mesh with what we know of her and their relationship.

That's assuming you use a system with character classes like D&amp;D.
<p></p>Also,  RD's mindset just isn't inclined toward social manipulation. She tends to be blunt and straightforward,  as evidenced by <em>Suited for Success</em> and <em>A Friend in Deed</em>. If she says something,  she probably means it.

            I wasn't wondering about a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> pony RPG; I was wondering about the in-universe game that the mane six would play in the hypthetical episode or fanfic.
<p></p>Thoughts on this thread? I'm impressed that there's so much activity here with no new episodes,  and shocked that there's a media thread even less on-topic than the <em>Homestuck</em> thread.
