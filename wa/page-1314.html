            Rarity caught on with me immediately; "Suited For Success" was my second episode.
<p></p>...for some reason I feel nostalgic for the first time I watched the show ("Fall Weather Friends" on <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHub" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHub">Hubworld.com</a>; I went there under the assumption that <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FarFromTheCase" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FarFromTheCase">Hasbro had yanked any episode uploads from YouTube</a>).

            Dear Princess Celestia,  today I learned that doing an accountancy course while thoroughly bored and somewhat sleep deprived can give you visions of Pinkie Pie sticking her head out of your book with a cry of "ForEVerrrrrr!" Your faithful student,  Count Dorku.

            I liked all the mane cast,  if I had to chose the one I liked the least it would be Rarity,  but she's definitely improved on that,  and even then it was only a low opinion compared to all the others.
<p></p>The ones that really needed to grow on me were the CMC,  at first I really didn't like them all that much,  but going back they've grown on me.

            I initially wasn't a fan of Fluttershy but she grew on me over time. I was mostly indifferent to Applejack but she's basically in my top five now. Rainbow Dash was a character I actually disliked more as time went on. Originally I was like "She's kinda cool" to "dear god,  the only than worse than this is Rarity."

            For the first few episodes,  I would have sworn that Rarity's name was Vanity.  I really started warming up to her,  and by "Dog And Pony Show",  I was convinced she was Best Pony.

            Speaking of Discord,  it would be cool if they revealed the following:
<p></p>1. He in fact was the one who manipulated Luna into falling out with Celestia (via astral projection from his stone prison or something).
<p></p>2. If not for him,  Equestria would never have existed to begin with. Think about it. What we might call "primal chaotic forces" shaped Earth long before life was first introduced. I'd think of Discord as the primordial creator who provided the foundation of Equestria. Problem is,  he just was too damn crazy to allow any stability there.

            Speaking of origin stories,  I was thinking about the fanfic being planned out in mah head when I began to wonder just where in the world the elements came from? I mean,  the physical ones,  not just the idealogy behind them. Who crafted those things? o3o

            A new synopsis has been released for episode 5: "Sweetie Belle plans a part in honour of sisterly unity with Rarity,  with very little planning. When Rarity refuses to attend,  Sweetie Belle becomes angry and disowns her as a friend"
<p></p>Hells yeah! Definitely a sweetie focus episode. I was sort of afraid when I heard people talking about she and rarity would be sharing the episode with AJ and Apple Bloom. I'm okay with Apple Bloom and all,  but she's had her own episode. Sweetie needs one of her own,  now.
<p></p>I'm just hoping Rarity won't be getting too much of the spotlight here. It would be nice to see them together,  and to see if she feels a bit guilty about making Sweetie angry,  but the kiddo really does need the spotlight here.
