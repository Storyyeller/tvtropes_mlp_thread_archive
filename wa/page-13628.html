            Well,  it could be that the daughter of the last queen was sent away,  and Celestia and Luna carefully preserved both the knwoledge of he kingdom,  and the blood of its royal line,  in preparation for the day they could both be restored. And Cadance is the current member of the royal line of the Crystal Kingdom.

            This has always confused me. If it takes six ponies to wield six Elements of Harmony how could Luna and Celestia do it? The only explanation I can come up with is that the Elements form around those they choose and compliment the wielder's strengths and abilities.

            I think that two is the absolute minimum for hem to be used with anything appproaching their full potential,  seeing as the underlying force behind them is harmony and unity
<p></p>When Celestia was forced to use them by herself,  she was only able to imprison Luna instead of cleansing her.

            Awesome,  the only thing the MS America bits were good for were the extra Mane Six snipits. More pony,  no matter how small is always good.

            @Dark: My theory is that it doesn't matter how many ponies you have as long as all the races are included. Celestia and Luna were apparently "natural" alicorns (in the sense that they were born that way rather than ascending),  so they counted for multiple races.   So without any alicorns,  you could have as few as three ponies,  as long as there's one of each race. Although even with unicorns I'd assume you'd have to have at least 2 became it's impossible to manifests those qualities with only one person.

            Yay,  there's that catchy opening sequence. Can anyone confirm the opening was cut in the broadcast version to give them 32 seconds of extra time? I think the episode with the opening added is a bit over 23 minutes which would be a little too long for TV broadcast.

            I know this is a continually-repeating topic,  but which Elements do you think each sister used during their time with them? Let us assume that one of them was commanding the sixth element,  even if they didn't have a name for it (or truly knew it was around) at the time.

            Now with the season finale,  I've thought of a theory. Luna and Celestia were part of a previous Mane Six with Celestia a unicorn and Luna a pegasus who were born the same way the Cake babies were. Either the original Six wielded the Elements the next down a line in a long tradition,  or somehow created the Elements using Celestia's spells in or as a counterbalance to Discord's chaos while ruling over Equestria. Shaky,  but stranger theories have popped up.

            The reason why we don't hear about the other 4 is because Luna and Celestia were the only ones who ascended leaving the others mortal. That,  or Starswirl was the original wielder of the Element of Magic.

            Pfft. Like Celestia would take the throne without comissioning a stained-glass window commemorating every single time her team did something.

            @Dark: If Star Swirl were the element of magic,  it means he'd have been able to fix the spell,  because Friendship = Magic in this setting.
<p></p>As for which elements Celestia and Luna had,  it's always been my headcanon that Celestia had Kindness,  Laughter,  and Loyalty,  while Luna had Honesty,  Generosity,  and Magic.
