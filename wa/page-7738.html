            I could see something that would pull the situation off afterowrds: Pinkie is not the type of pony to take anything seriously,  so she likely wouldn't show stress during a fight. AFTERWORDS,  however,  she would drop like a sack of potatoes from the pent-up stress getting released. Show she wasn't infallible.
<p></p>Of course that's just a thought,  I doubt it's what happens.

            @Seraphem: What I mean is,  if you don't find out that the actions aren't OOC until like 20 chapters later,  there's a bit of an issue.  Think of it from the perspective of somebody reading through the story for the first time.  There's <em>zero</em> indication at this point that there's an explanation for the OOC actions at this point of the story.  You know that there is because you've read that far.  That said,  it isn't a story-killing issue,  but I do think it's something that should have been done a little differently.
<p></p>As for making the assumption that they are acting in character,  unless I'm misunderstanding you,  it basically boils down to "Even though the characters are doing something that looks out of character,  just assume that they aren't".

            It's not OOC-ness so much as it is extremely bad ideas that somehow flew under the radar to screw up the world. The only real OOC moments have been with Pinkie Pie,  and I know those are <em>after</em> a bunch of development with her,  so they're not exactly wrong. That doesn't mean I like it,  though.

<p></p>^ Yeah,  most of the bad stuff happened because of a series of misunderstandings and things that seemed like a good idea at the time.
