            @Mousa: Oh cool,  you're a musician?  What do you use?  I've just recently started trying to learn to use FL Studios (firing it up right now actually),  but I haven't really learned all it's tricks yet.  I played guitar for a few years,  but I'm more interested in doing electronic music now.

            <div class="quoteblock"> and I'm sure as far as stories go no one cares that there are a bunch of Fluttershy recolors helping a baby/Angel/Spike/etc. across an island. </div>
You could try to change their palettes to some of the official Fluttershy recolors seen on the packaging for the toys.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Yoshis can grab things with their uberlong tongue,  hold it in their mouth,  and either spit it back out as a projectile or swallow it to make an egg.
<p></p>Not sure how you plan to reconstruct that with ponies. Or anything non-Yoshi,  for that matter. </div>
If you're substituting Spike for Baby Mario,  you could <em>maybe</em> engineer it so that the tongue is emerging from his mouth instead—'cause hey,  maybe someone just happened to <strong>teleport</strong> those eggs into his mouth!  Too bad this would be all messed up whenever he gets captured.

            ...Hm.  To be honest,  I'm not okay with her being changed,  but if this had been her voice from the start (and they didn't "fix" her eyes),  I'd have been okay with that.  She sounds a bit like BaldDumboRat.

            @Bluespade,  meet Noteflight,  I discovered it this past summer,  composed my first song on it an here is progress on <a class="urllink" href="http://www.noteflight.com/scores/view/9a039fcf6de885357b780ba1363aedf3b0560131">Twilight's theme<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
<p></p>I play the piano an I sing but this gives me the chance to add in other instruments as though I was still notating with a piano,  it's brilliant.
<p></p>And color me uninterested in electronic stuff. I am so tired of every geek music being some electronic glitch dub 8-bit techno remix thingy,  I'm sick of it. Sorry.

            @L Mage: In the itunes version of "The Last Roundup" they rerecorded her voice,  removed her name from the dialogue,  and underped her eyes.  The first I can live with,  the second I think is a major overreaction but understandable,  and the third is just dumb because <em>her derped eyes were her defining trait</em>.

            Yeah,  the voice I don't mind,  the name I was ambivalent on,  but the thing with the eyes bugs me.  There was literally no reason to change that.  Hopefully they'll leave it alone in future episodes.

Give it a few days and we'll see if it's actually a problem.  I mean,  it sucks,  but it's not like they excised her completely.  The only thing I'm worried about is if some of the more...impulsive bronies whip up a shitstorm with Hasbro over it.

            And I see we've started to talk about the Derpy change. Yes,  its true. The iTunes version of "The Last Roundup" omits her name,  changes her voice,  and if you look closely...underped her eyes. STAY CALM!

<p></p>Honestly,  I'm OK with the voice,  but it saddens me to see people made a fuss over Derpy in the first place. I remember when the Luna episode was coming,  we all braced ourselves... and then everything was fine and everyone loved canon!Luna,  despite it being wildly different than most of us imagined (except <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/Progress" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/Progress">Progress</a>).
<p></p>All they wanted to do was make a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomNod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomNod">Fandom Nod</a> with the most popular background pony,  and yet people whined. *sigh*

            Underping the eyes is a small things compared to CHANGING HER NAME BACK. It breaks the cardinal rule of dealing with your fandom: never react instantly to their wishes,  especially when those wishes are STUPID.
<p></p>Seriously this might just break the internet.

            Like I said,  I love her voice.  She sounds adorable both ways,  and if they'd used the second voice with her crossed eyes,  I would have absolutely no compunctions at all with the scene.

            @Mousa: By electronic music I just mean music you can create with a computer.  This Noteflight thing counts in my opinion.  I love piano,  use it aplenty in my own stuff.  I'm basically a fan of all types of music though,  so I can't say I disapprove of electronica.
