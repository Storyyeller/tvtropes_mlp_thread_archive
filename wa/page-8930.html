            ok then,  A Canterlot Wedding,  Part 1
<p></p>woah,  RD literally put her hoof in her mouth.
<p></p>well,  they opened season 1 with the mane cast preparing a celebration,  and now they'll close season 2 with the same. Hooray <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">Book Ends</a>!
<p></p>gasp,  twis brother!...(actually,  I've been spoiled on that point as well)
<p></p>BBBFF,  huh.
<p></p>a song number already?
<p></p>why did that shot of canterlot castle have it encased in a forcefield?
<p></p>well that was a short song.
<p></p>no,  seriously,  what's the deal with the forcefield? and yeah,  two ponies with pikes are totally gonna stop a train.
<p></p>ok,  forecfield is due to a terrorist threat. Fair enough.
<p></p>wait,  shining armor is keeping that forcefield up all by himself? aren't city wide forcefields usually a group effort kinda thing? There's gotta be more trustworthy unicorns in canterlot with that kinda power output.
<p></p>ok,  cadence was a foalsitter despite also being a princess. Good to see princesses in equestria are allowed to do as they please.
<p></p>woah,  cadence can cast charm as an at will ability? neat.
<p></p>uh oh,  cadence doesn't remember twi...I wonder why that could be...*coughchangelingcough*  <br>...ok,  I may have been spoiled a bit more than I let on
<p></p>ice sculptures fall under catering?
<p></p>man,  is celestia gonna be on lookout the entire episode?
<p></p>pinkies favorite song again.
<p></p>woah,  luna! haven't seen her in a while. and I guess celestia won't be on lookout the entire episode
<p></p>ok,  I really don't like Twily as a nickname.
<p></p>gasp! imposter confirmed!
<p></p>new bridesmaids? Cadenza didn't like lyra and those other 2? (that was lyra,  right?)
<p></p>hmm...I wonder what determines the color of a unicorns magic field...
<p></p>and twi puts her hoof down! Nobodies gonna believe her,  but it has to be done.
<p></p>gogo <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a>!
<p></p>oh,  that's why the song at the start was so short. Because it had a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkReprise" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkReprise">Dark Reprise</a>.

            Fimfiction is simultaneously one of my favorite and least favorite sites on the internet. Plenty of cool stuff,  lots of laughs at bad stuff,  but then there's the <em>really</em> bad stuff that makes you hate the world just for reading the description.
