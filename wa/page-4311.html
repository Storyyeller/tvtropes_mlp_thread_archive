            Looking at tonight's Drawfriend,  I saw a pic of Snips and Snails,  made me wonder...whatever happened to them?  I mean I was no fan (they are pretty lame),  but it seems as though they disappeared after the first season.  Did they appear in season 2 at all?  I think they might have been in the Discord episode...

            So I just watched Winter Wrap Up. I don't know why,  but after watching it,  I felt like Big Mac and/or Caramel are gay. Or bi-curious. Or it might be the little <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl">Yaoi Fangirl</a> in me saying that...
<p></p>I'm sure there are gay ponies though. Sometimes I wish this was a more adult show. I would love to see real LGBT issues handled in a respectful and knowledgeable way.

            @Ilsemmer: A lot of people seem to think that.  Food for thought: When Cheerilee told Big Mac that the kids were trying to get them together,  they both laughed as thought that were a ridiculous possibility,  as though there was some reason it would never happen.  Personally I don't think he's gay though.
<p></p>Oh,  and it seems to me as though the show is (very slowly) getting more mature.
<p></p>Anyway,  I'm going now.  I've spent way too much time in the thread today.

            Yeah Caramel/Mac is a fairly constant ship. At least till Hearts and Hooves day proved he's at least Bi.
<p></p>and ohhh pony sexuality discussions,  haven't had that in a while (which by this threads standards means like a week. I'm firmly on the Sex is no big deal camp,  either it's not something they do for pleasure,  only breeding,  or it is something they do for fun,  but either way when it comes to relationships they care more about the emotional connection then any physical ting,  including gender.
<p></p>would debate more,  but need sleep

            The thing about LGBT issues being handled in anything is that by drawing any attention to them you are immediately handling them the wrong way. They can only be handled correctly by not treating it any differently than a heterosexual relationship.
<p></p>This show already seems to do that right,  as there were quite a few same-sex background pairings in Hearts and Hooves Day. Though,  they are,  of course,  entirely circumstantial and mean nothing in the long run.

            ha ha. No. I like Fluttermac too. It's a really cute pairing. I'm actually not a shipper,  although I do enjoy reading Shipping fanfiction. So far I've read Big Mac/Male OC,  Big Mac/ Fluttershy,  Big Mac/ Rainbow Dash,  Big Mac/ Twilight,  and Big Mac/Caramel. And Braeburn/ Soarin. Also,  Big Mac has a lot of ships doesn't he?? It's kind of amazing...
<p></p>It's just that Big Mac is one of those characters that I can see being gay. Like,  if they came out of the closet,  I would just say: "Oh. Okay. Yeah,  I can kind of see it."

            @Lurker: Same here.  I want to see a work where the same-sex relationships just <em>are</em>; like they're treated exactly like any other sort of relationship and aren't given any special attention.
<p></p>That said,  I tend to think that pony sexuality just works the same way as it does in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>; we just don't see much of it because it's a kids show.  And really,  I don't care too much about that anyway.  I think sex gets way too much attention in media,  so when a work comes along that doesn't really include it,  I tend to prefer that it stays that way.

            Yes. I am involved with LGBT issues in my school,  and I really wish that the media would portray us in a realistic light that doesn't lean on stereotypes like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian">Butch Lesbian</a>. So more like,  I wish more media that would show a REALISTIC relationship within the LGBT community. There are a few books and movies like that,  but it's kind of rare.

<p></p>Hi,  I think you're the 501st account to post in this thread. You would have been 500th,  but Light Phaser just had to go and ruin it by posting with an alt earlier today and stealing the spot.
<p></p><em>For instance,  one of the final arcs of the story deals with the main character,  a Technical Pacifist,  struggling with the decision to kill the main villain. EVERY SINGLE character he asks for advise tells him to suck it up and kill the guy.</em>
<p></p>I don't think that's the best example to pick,  since in the end they have a cheap copout and Aang avoids killing Ozai anyway. (Nevermind the hundreds of mooks he killed on the way). Actually,  that whole moral "dilemma" and the way it was resolved ruined the ending for me.
<p></p>If you want examples of Avatar being mature,  City of Walls and Secrets would be the best example to point to.
<p></p><em>Ohh yeah! How is Cysmas's quest of Archive Binge? </em>
