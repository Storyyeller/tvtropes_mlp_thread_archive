            Sombra was pretty flat as a character,  the other villains were much more live.
<p></p>Maybe having dialogue helped.

            Well,  that was certainly something.  It was a good episode,  although I don't think it was quite as amazing as the season 2 premiere and finale.  Sombra really needed a bit more characterization,  and I felt like there was too much of a disconnect between what Twilight was doing and what the rest of the cast was up to.  It would have helped a lot of Sombra would have actually had some sort of personality past "generically evil".
<p></p>That said,  the humor was good as always,  and it was sweet to see Spike finally do something important.  And in the last few minutes when Sombra actually did something other than being ominous it was pretty cool.  And the animation was awesome.

            Sombra certainly didn't have much personality,  but he made up for it with some pretty awesome traps and planning. Not to mention that his powers were really awesome. The real meat of the episode was in the character development,  anyway. Season-spanning arc,  ho!
