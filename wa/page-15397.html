            Well,  I would recommend the Canterlot Wedding episodes because of the pony bug succubus,  but in reality,  those episodes are quite sugary.
<p></p>Basically all of the Rarity episodes have stereotypically girly premises and amazingly tasteful executions.
<p></p>The two Return Of Harmony Episodes have an evil chaos god show up,  and it's awesome. That would be a good place to start.
<p></p>The Halloween episode Luna Eclipsed trades sugar for ham and cheese.
<p></p>Magic Duel is funny and sugar lite.
<p></p>In reality,  you're going to have a hard time finding any episodes that don't have sugar. For stuff like that,  you need to read the fanfics.

<p></p>I don't think that's the answer he is looking for.
<p></p>Really though,  if your that averse to "sugar" you should not be watching this show. At all.

            I was afraid you'd say that. It probably does come down to my personal taste,  so I won't bother trying any more.<br>
Is there any way I can stop being drawn to something I hate,  like a moth to a flame? I've thought about ponies a dozen times today before posting here,  and it worries me.<br>
@Amora: Then be rude. I'd take any advice. This is unbearable.

            Huh. My desire for a MLP x Princess Tutu crossover fic rose tenfold after I remembered the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">Arc Words</a>.
<p></p>"May those who accept their fate be granted happiness; may those who defy it be granted glory."
<p></p>Those words alone could spawn something <em>epic.</em>
<p></p>Edit: The reason I like it so much is because it brings up a rather important and interesting philosophical quandary for me. What would you choose if you had to pick between happiness and free will?

            Okay,  only because you asked.  This might be a bit long.
<p></p><em>One thing I thought of was researching the setting well enough to run a tabletop RPG in it,  then I'd be sick of it. Of course that would require playing with bronies,  and I won't lie,  I have some prejudice against them.</em>
<p></p>Well for this I don't have much to say except that not all of us are as creepy as you might think.  I've seen the full gambit on both sides and I only judge by individuals only after I get to talk to them for a bit. I have no idea why you'd do a tabletop RPG MLP themed if you want to "avoid" bronies.
<p></p><em>I could just force myself to watch more episodes and skip over the songs,  which seem to be the main source of my pain. At least the adventure episodes.</em>
<p></p>You really shouldn't force yourself something that you think you might not enjoy.  From the sound of it,  it feels like you are not going into it with an open mind,  therefore you's just be wasting your time.
<p></p><em>I might actually be resisting the fandom more than the franchise,  what with its endless fan-wanking (and literal wanking) over background ponies who have little to no canon behind them. I don't care about Time Turner! He doesn't even look like David Tennant! His eyes are a different color and his hair spikes the other way! I don't WANT to care!</em>
<p></p>Then don't care.  I don't really have anything else to say about this.  Yes there are some background ponies I like more than others,  but I don't discuss about them,  I simply enjoy the art others make of them.
<p></p><em>I don't WANT to debate about the best or worst pony! I've never seen something so pointless!</em>
<p></p>You're right,  it is pointless.  Rarity is the best pony,  the creators said so,  end of discussion.
<p></p><em>I don't WANT to wear a fedora and "20% cooler" T-shirt!</em>
<p></p>Then don't.  I don't wear anything pony myself,  it doesn't mean I'm not a fan.
<p></p>"I don't WANT to keep up with fandom in-jokes,  especially ask blogs!"
<p></p>Once again,  don't if you don't want to.  The jokes and ask blogs are there for the fans. If you're not a fan,  then why are you bothering with them?
<p></p><em>I don't WANT to "love and tolerate" everything bronies do! Putting Cupcakes on Youtube where children can see it? NOT OKAY.</em>
<p></p>Okay now to where it gets good.  Children shouldn't be on the internet without supervision,  or at least some form of parental control.  It is not our responsibility to take care of someone else's child spawn for them online.  You don't want to raise your own kids,  don't have them in the first place.
<p></p><em>I don't WANT to pretend Derpy isn't offensive! YOU decided she was mentally challenged,  not the show,  YOU,  because of her appearance!</em>
<p></p>Wow,  just wow.  From what I've seen and read,  the majority never said she was offensive,  nor did they say she was mentally challenged.  I had a friend who had a similar condition with their eyes,  and you know what?  HE WAS NORMAL!  Yeah,  he was a bit clumsy at times,  but he learned how to cope with it.  There was no difference except his eyes were off kilter.  Most did not even notice.  God damn,  every time I hear someone say "Derpy is offensive" it is never an actual fan of the show...
<p></p><em>I don't WANT to become one of you. Is that possible? To just watch the show and not be creepy about it?</em>
<p></p>Yes it is quite possible.  I don't think I'm creepy about it,  hell most of the people I deal with on a regular basis hardly even know I'm a brony.  I don't force the show on others,  nor do I voice my opinion unless asked for it.  The show is not for everyone,  either you'll like it or you won't.  There's plenty of things out there that you can enjoy,  on or offline.  Find what you like and leave alone the other people that do like things that you don't.
<p></p>Now go have a nice day.

<p></p>Recently I have been watching <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a> (my avatar is very misleading,  I know). Sometimes I entertain myself by wondering if when the M6 channels the Elements of Harmony,  they are actually using the Spiral Energy.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>(For those of you who haven't watched the show,  it's basically force of magic fueled by raw emotion that can kick the law of universe in the face)

            What's particularly hilarious about that post is that I'm pretty sure that 90% of the people in this thread don't do those things,  at least not seriously.   I mean,  I don't think we've had a non-jokey "best pony" discussion in months.
<p></p>Mostly we just talk about cheese.
<p></p>Also,  is Derpibooru down for anyone else?

I have to wonder two things about this. First,  what does a fedora have to do with ponies? Unless you're referring to Egophiliac's ponysona,  but beyond that... bluh?
