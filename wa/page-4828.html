<p></p>Rarity has used the word mule as an insult on a few occasions and I think there were some other things... I don't recall what her behavior was like in Over A Barrel though.  Has Pinkie said anything like that before?

            The only time I remember her using the "mule" thing was in "A Dog and Pony Show" when she was deliberately trying to be as annoying as possible.  Other than that I can't think of any times she has that sort of tendency.

<p></p>Yeah,  I forgot about that.  Kind of ironic sense she's easily Ponyville's most eccentric character (except maybe Jelly guy),  you'd think she'd be more openminded.

            dude,  chill,  they already explained why they can't sell them out side America,  don't blame them,  blame your networks. Most of them require that Hasbro agree not to sell access to any episodes of the show to there audience prior to it airing on There network there.
<p></p>And it is also theorized that that exact issue is one of the reason's Hasbro is so lax about enforcing the 'official' policy against uploading the episodes to youtube.

            And again,  though yes the overall meaning of the episode was racism is bad,  what the ponies were doing was NOT racism,  they didn't fear her because she was a Zebra,  none of them even knew she wasn't just a normal earth pony with a weird die job until Twilight told them.

            @ L Mage: Really? Pinkie was making up a song to inspire more hatred of Zecora,  I think that's worse than being afraid for your sister's safety.

            To be fair PP makes up songs about <em>everything</em>,  Applejack was being callous and close minded (and also dismissing Applebloom's deviating opinion without giving it any consideration)

            also,  none of the ponies <em>hated</em> Zecora,  they were <em>afraid</em> of her,  yes fear can lead to hatred,  but they never really crossed that line.

            we got distracted,  it was good,  but one of the ones that how good varies,  for me,  it was good,  but not great,  pretty much a decent,  average episode.
<p></p>Except for Spike,  Spike was bucking awesome in this one.

            Speaking of abridged series,  they should totally use the melody of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendshipIsWitchcraft" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendshipIsWitchcraft">Pinkie's Brew</a> for a song. Not the lyrics obviously,  because that song is pretty dark when you think about it.
