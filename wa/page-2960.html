            <div class="quoteblock">1.) What type of environment would you like?  (Desert,  Forest,  Underwater Bubble Houses,  Enchanted Sky City,  Ect)</div>
I'd love an Enchanted Sky City,  but assuming it's like Cloudsdale,  that would be a terrible decision.  Given that it looks like I only get to specify one type and that my pegasi can control the weather,  I'd go for wide open plain.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">2.) You can tame one type of beast that has been in the show so far for defense only.  Remember,  ponies are peaceful! You have animals to do your dirty work!  Which one do you choose? (Manticore,  Dragon,  Hydra,  Cockatrice,  Ect)</div>
Hmmm,  for combat and only combat,  eh?  I'd probably go Cockatrice for the most bang for my buck.  The smaller animal would be less maintenance and a petrifying gaze is extremely powerful.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">3.) What is your society primarily going to focus on? (Science,  Worshiping Luna,  Rapid Population Expansion,  Reading a bunch of bad fanfiction,  ect)</div>
Probably population expansion at first.  Once the city is looking big enough,  I'd probably swap to science.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
You need to figure out how to incorporate each type of pony (earth,  pegasus,  unicorn) into your fledgling nation with the goal of becoming a utopia in under 10 years! Are your unicorns the ones that maintain your bubble houses while your hydra taming earth ponies farm kelp and Luna worshiping pegusai write bad fanfiction?</div>
General roles would be for earth ponies and pegasi to work closely together to achieve optimal food output.  The unicorns would probably do science and work with earth ponies on construction.  Once everything looks stable enough,  I'd let individuals in a race drift to whatever interests them.

<p></p>Dragons or hydras,  but most likely dragons.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">3.) What is your society primarily going to focus on? (Science,  Worshiping Luna,  Rapid Population Expansion,  Reading a bunch of bad fanfiction,  ect)</div>
<p></p>Fashion,  so I have an excuse to talk to Rarity. Plus ponies in clothes are always nice.

<p></p>Unicorns and earth ponies work to help design clothing,  own shops,  etc. Pegasi control the weather and dragons.

            1. environment:  I'd probably go with desert.  It's what I'm familiar with,  and I know what a desert society needs to do to thrive.  Forest would be awesome too though.
<p></p>2. critter: Windigos,  full stop.  They have the added benefit of only being dangerous to ponies who are causing trouble so it's more difficult to abuse your power.
<p></p>3. Focus: I'm going with infrastructure and social construction.  The desert is a hard place,  and you need to cooperate in order to survive.  First order of business is getting a working irrigation system and proper water-laws in place.  Pegasi scout for bodies of water and springs,  excavation would be handled by unicorns and earth ponies,  and then agriculture is the domain of the earth ponies themselves.
<p></p>Unicorns would be absolutely vital in devising better pest-control methods to aid the earth ponies,  and the pegasi would need to set up an extremely extensive weather control system,  roaming hundreds of miles to gather moisture nessecary for making rain,  and possibly setting up a system of trade with other regions to bring in clouds from more humid areas.  They could have cloud drives like the old west had cattle drives,  except in reverse.

            Something occurred to me: if becoming the leader involves having to be an alicorn,  I'm not sure I could handle it.  And not for lack of ability to plan and manage.  I'd more than likely get quite attached to my ponies and being immortal would make that suck.  A lot.

            The videos I saw weren't actual gameplay,  just a video done to look like the games,  with Ace as the actual attorney of course.  It's freaking awesome though,  and long.

            1) Environment:  Some type of tropical/temperate rainforest area surrounding a lake.  There would be farms,  suburban areas,  industrial locations,  etc. along the shore line with the rest of the buildings located above and on top of the lake.
<p></p>2) Animal Taming:  Timberwolves.  Good for not only defending the shoreline but also defending against sea monster the lake produces in case any surface and attack.
<p></p>3) Focus:  The locations around the shore will be merely for population expansion while the facilities above the lake will be devoted to the science,  specifically the creation of electronic devices,  working with aquatic lifeforms,  more efficient and less intrusive forms of weather manipulation,  and experimental magics.
<p></p>4) Roles:  The Earth ponies will be in charge of the shoreline and heavy duty construction as well as providing food,  possibly mostly from farming fruit trees raised from the forest itself and/or gathering from wild life.  The unicorns will handle most of the above lake construction and will be the ones doing most of the scientific research with possible assistance from the other two races.  Pegasi will not only regulate the weather but will also be acting mostly as security,  acting as both scouts for threats outside the settlement and against hostile sea creatures under the lake surface using specialized unicorn made suits.
<p></p>Both Earth and Pegasus ponies will be in charge of taming the Timberwolves,  Unicorns and Pegasi will be in charge to providing the experimental weather techniques used by the settlement,  and Earth and Unicorn ponies will handle the experimental tech with the unicorns doing inital designs and experimentation and Earth ponies testing them out as well as providing revisions to make them more practical.

            Fallen: Yea... I've had a decent amount of time to explore the concept,  as before I got into pony,  I spent some time writing some original stuff.  One of my characters was a lot like a toned down Pinkie Pie in terms of being cheerful,  forward and wanting to be friends with everyone.  She also happened to be one of my immortal characters and writing her believably ended in a hard crash.  Pinkamina style (canon version,  not the fanon psycho).
<p></p>CDRW: The main character is Phoenix Wright,  not Ace.  Ace Attorney is the name of the series.  Cases are typically pretty long (they get longer as they go... first case is anywhere from 30-90 mins depending on the game and the last case is usually a huge epic complex case that runs 5-6 hours),  but there's only 4-5 per cartridge.  They are indeed quite good,  if a little rail roady at times.  Oh and don't mind the occasional idiot balls (they keep 'em to a minimum,  but the ones that do show up are doozies that may induce face palming).

<p></p>Damn I was planning on a nice Dwarven inspired society and it became this. Never give me power,  I do not deserve it.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> 1.) What type of environment would you like? (Desert,  Forest,  Underwater Bubble Houses,  Enchanted Sky City,  Ect) </div>
<p></p>Mountain,  we're going for a fully enclosed Pony society. What could possibly go wrong?
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> 2.) You can tame one type of beast that has been in the show so far for defense only. Remember,  ponies are peaceful! You have animals to do your dirty work! Which one do you choose? (Manticore,  Dragon,  Hydra,  Cockatrice,  Ect)</div>
<p></p>Timberwolves. As they are plant based they should be easy to care for. Plus they can be given to lonely ponies who yearn for companionship. They presumable reproduce like plants so they will rapidly increase in population. They are also somewhat related to the growing of food,  so bonus food when no defence is needed yay. And if I have a surplus,  free firewood.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">3.) What is your society primarily going to focus on? (Science,  Worshiping Luna,  Rapid Population Expansion,  Reading a bunch of bad fanfiction,  ect)</div>
<p></p>First Mining,  then Population explosion and finally Science! How long will it take for underground ponies to go insane? Does it happen to Pegasi the fastest. Will ponies go into an anarchistic mess if unsupervised. So many tests and as an Alicorn I'll last long enough to supervise them all.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">You need to figure out how to incorporate each type of pony (earth,  pegasus,  unicorn) into your fledgling nation with the goal of becoming a utopia in under 10 years! Are your unicorns the ones that maintain your bubble houses while your hydra taming earth ponies farm kelp and Luna worshiping pegusai write bad fanfiction?</div>
<p></p>At the beginning I'll divide my ponies into two groups,  half are devoted to farming,  half to mining out the mountain and under it. The mined out portion of the mountain will be divided into three areas,  an opening area which will be the smallest and consist almost entirely of 10 gates that decrease in size the further into the area you go. With the exception of the outermost gate they will only be lockable from the outside. Then past those gates there will be a long diverging set of tunnels each will lead to the third area. There'll also be sleeping facilities and a lot of storage area.
<p></p>The third area will be 100 identical habitats that are connected to the second area via the previously mentioned tunnels. The doors once again will be lockable from the outside only. I'll hope I don't strike Adamantine.
<p></p>Anyway,  I'll divy up the labour by having Earth Ponies doing most of the initial mining,  Unicorns doing the precision stuff and Pegasi giving me highish ceiling. Outside,  Pegasi will give me good weather,  Earth Ponies will grow crops and tend to the Timberwolves and Unicorns will build structures for outside the mountain.
<p></p>This is all going to take ages,  that's okay I need a high population for later anyway. Which brings me to my next point. I need to give incentives for high family units. Not sure how yet,  larger food rations perhaps. Anyway if I can get each pair to produce 10 foals,  then my next generation will have 540 ponies all in all. Which is not enough. Pair them up and try to do the same and I can have 2700 ponies. Famines may occur,  this is not necessarily my problem as I'll be an immortal Alicorn. Riots may occur. I'll make sure the Timberwolf handlers are well treat I'll need them to maintain order.
<p></p>Anyway,  once I get enough ponies,  lottery time. 500 can stay outside,  400 for the second area and 6000 for the combined living spaces of the third area (60 each). Then science can occur. The outside group will be a mixture of all races. The inside will all be Unicorns. And the third will vary. Two habitats will be all Earth Pony for example. Two will be 99 Mares and One Stallion,  two will be 99 Stallions and One Mare.
<p></p>After these ponies have all gone to their assigned areas (force may be required for the test subjects) the science can begin. 50% of the habitats will not have food delivered to them,  50% will. The second group's job is to monitor and document the effects on the third groups while the first group produces the food necessary for the habitats. Once science has been done I have no idea.
