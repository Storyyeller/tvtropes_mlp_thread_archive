            @ Dark:  I guess if depends on whether or not it's a <em>massive</em> wall of text.  There was one such post with the text posted over a pic of Big Mac,  of all ponies.  It got a lot of downvotes.

            I think that was less due to the text wall and more that the quote in question was actually from a serious conversation and sounded kinda douche-y and elitist out of context.
