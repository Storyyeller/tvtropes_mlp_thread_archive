            As an extension on point one my headcanon is that Luna is more powerful than Celestia so it wasn't her becoming evil that gave her the power,  she already had it.

            <div class="quoteblock">Yeah pretty much,  some people think there's an evil space miasma that made Luna into Nightmare Moon before or after that first step. I disagree with that fanon personally. </div>
For what it's worth,  I believe Faust herself liked the idea that some outside corrupting force contributed to the rise of Nightmare Moon (and to the freeing of Discord).
<p></p>But at the same time,  I'm not cool with any interpretation that completely absolves Luna of all wrongdoing. Heck,  her scene of reconciliation with Celestia pretty strongly implies that Luna bore at least some responsibility for the Nightmare Moon incident.
<p></p>So,  either NMM was all Luna's fault,  or the Nightmare was an external corrupting force which was only able to possess Luna because of the resentment that was already in Luna's heart.

            Now that raises a really big question.
<p></p>Is there any external force of evil in Equestria,  like,  say,  Satan in Abrahamic religions?
<p></p>I think I can believe Luna being actually more powerful than Celestia. In Judeo-Christian and Classical mythologies,  the darkness existed before the light.

            @J Teeth,  I used to look up to his work back in the day,  but I just have difficulty believing that after all these years,  I have in some capacity surpassed him,  that's not how it should be.
<p></p>On the Nightmare Moon topic,  I like to think Luna had acquired a power on her own initiative without considering the consequences to her mental stability.

It's all to slot in with my other headcanon of Luna previously being the Bearer of the Element of Generosity,  falling when she came to believe that no matter how much she gave,  no one would ever notice.

The official position is that there is no canon beyond what actually gets shown in the show. Faust has shared a few ideas she's had regarding background info,  but has also said that the current showrunners could render those non-canon in any future episode.

            Eternal Night is pretty orderly,  though. If Discord had anything to do with Nightmare Moon (and I personally don't think he did),  it was just setting her against Celestia because of the chaos their conflict would cause. I doubt he would actually want it to be night forever. He prefers day and night to be at random intervals,  instead.

<p></p>I like that philosophy. That's what I always thought the way <em>it should be.</em>
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> As d Roy said,  Darkness is before the Light. </div>
<p></p>Well,  like I said,  it's only in those two mythologies. I don't know how it is in other ones so who knows?
<p></p>That makes me think,  though. Usually,  a night is when there is no sun. As far as the current theory of universe goes,  there was really absolutely nothing before the sun. Would that mean that darkness was before existence of everything?

            Well my headcanon is that Luna was always naturally slightly more powerful. After vanquishing Discord however since Celestia was so favoured over Luna that no one ever went to Luna about their problems or to give tribute,  Luna had a lot more free time than Celestia and so split her time between working on her night sky and acquiring power to better defend Equestria in case another threat like Discord emerged. Nightmare Moon was just the form she took while channelling all that power.
<p></p>Edit: Luna isn't necessarily darkness,  she also brings light in the form of stars and the moon. She's a mixture of light and dark.
