Thanks. That's weird though. The slidshow doesn't make this new IP look like it is aimed at older fans at all.

            Admittedly,  the fandom is starting to lose its appeal for me.  I've separated myself from it before (after S2 ended,  if you recall),  and while I missed some of the thread interactions,  I wouldn't say that I felt a hole had been torn in my heart or anything.  Especially now,  with mixed feelings about the finale and other recent announcements (and especially about how those mixed feelings have been received by others),  I don't feel all that much loyalty to the fandom anymore.  The <em>show</em> is still fine,  for the most part; I just don't feel much impetus to hang around in,  say,  the off-season anymore.

            The fandom certainly isn't perfect. And I will be thankful because of that that even with these recent nods,  the show isn't changing completely to what they want. It's not changing everything according to what fans demand,  it makes a few harmless additions that they may benefit from and they know they can make good use of.
<p></p>If they did something like basically wrote an episode as simply a lampshaded apology over MMDW,  or adapted a fanfic word for word,  <em>then</em> I feel they would be going over the line.
<p></p>The one easter egg I feel may have been cheap was using Ditzy's fan name Derpy,  if only because they had their own name planned and it felt like a case of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotDoResearch" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotDoResearch">Did Not Do Research</a> considering the word's background.

            Yeah. And if ALL you look at is the negative,  you come off as needlessly pessimistic,  overly critical,  and rather short sighted.
<p></p>Are there issues? Yes,  but on the whole,  they are far far FAR minot compared to the good. And the majority of the issues,  are magnified far in excess of their actual impact by people bitching about there being an issue.
<p></p>well,  option two is to much of a legal nightmare to even consider.

<p></p>^^Well,  yeah - going back to MMDW would be a bit much.  I'd prefer just to mentally discontinue it,  or at least heavily alter it.
<p></p>^I'm not of the habit of not considering assholes assholes just because they say 'love and tolerate' at me.

I hate that sort of pandering,  especially since most of the time,  the show in question never actually changes according to these critisms and thinks lampshading just makes it all better.

            @Seraph: The <em>genesis</em> of the fandom was surprising; the <em>composition</em> is not.  I just wish people would stop conflating the two.

            @Red,  Seraphem; I honestly think the truth is somewhere in the middle.  There are definitely jackasses and terrible people in the fandom,  just the same as there are in every other fandom.  The fandom isn't a unified group; it's just a group of people who happen to like a certain show and don't necessarily have anything else in common.  At the same time,  I don't think those people define the fandom.  In all honesty,  I've never interacted all that much with the bulk of the drama because I find that you only find it if you go looking for it.  The problem is that the people who feel strongest about things are the loudest.  The fandom is 10% white knights who defend it at any cost and 10% fan dumb who like to stir shit up. That 20% of the fandom is the cause of 90% of the drama.  You can't claim that the FIM fanbase is better than any other fanbase. It isn't. At the same time,  you can't claim that the fanbase sucks,  because it doesn't. It's the people at both ends who are raising a stink about it.
<p></p>@Mio: I think what he means is that a lot of people assume or try to prove that bronies are somehow a better or more friendly fandom due to the fact that it formed around a feel-good show like FIM rather than something more cynical.  And I agree that there's a problem there.  People assume that people who are fans of the show will follow the whole "Love and tolerance" thing when the simple truth is that a lot of them don't because the fanbase is comprised of roughly the same demographics as any other internet fandom.

            @Mio: By genesis,  I mean the source show,  pretty much.  The basic thrust of my earlier post was that you see so many posts going around where people are like 'this show taught me how to love',  etc etc,  but the fandom itself is just another slice of Internet,  and anonymity makes bronies act like assholes the same way it does everyone else.  The lessons they're claiming don't seem to have stuck,  is my point.
<p></p>^This,  basically.  Maybe I just have the misfortune to run into too many of the white knights,  but it tends to polarize me a little bit,  I guess.
<p></p>Anyway,  I feel like I'm just dragging people down at this point... I'll be back later,  I guess.

            Yeah. Honestly,  I think that's fine,  that it's got the same composition as any other fandom you'd care to name. The only thing that ever seems to differ is the exact percentages,  and even then only in some cases. Ultimately,  I'd rather this be seen as just any other fandom,  rather than as some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DancingBear" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DancingBear">Dancing Bear</a>.
