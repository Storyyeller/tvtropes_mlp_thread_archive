<p></p>Goodness gracious.
<p></p>Anyway,  Twilight's my favorite. So I'd probably pick her by virtue of that alone. Besides,  the others,  except Fluttershy,  would probably get kind of grating if you had to live with them. I'm sure Twilight knows the value of personal space.
<p></p>Regarding Fluttershy,  I feel kind of awkward when interacting with people who are nice to a fault,  because I feel I have to judge for myself whether I'm imposing on them rather than expect them to say something when I'm bothering them. I have a friend who is kind of like that.
<p></p>Also,  it'd be nice to have someone to study with. I never had any older siblings,  and my younger brothers aren't usually very good at accepting help.

<p></p>As much as I love Rainbow Dash,  I could see her getting annoying as a sibling quite quickly.

            Hm...I think I'd have to go with Dash or Twilight,  I just don't think I'd get along well with the rest in a home setting. My sense of humour would hurt Fluttershy's feelings too much,  Pinkie would exhaust me,  and Rarity and Applejack I'd argue with Non-stop. Dash at l;east I'd be able to joke around with...but as for twilight,  it might be nice to have a older sibling who's <em>more</em> mature than me for a change.
<p></p>In other news,  I have to make a game for class...and I'm totally considering making it pony related...

            Sorry if I derail any conversations here - I need to voice this as best as I can.
<p></p>So far,  of course speaking,  this show has been made of win and positive messages about women in general in cartoons. Also,  it's funny,  action-packed,  and intelligent. Though its aim was young girls,  ANYBODY can get into it,  which is the best part.
<p></p>I have not encountered or paid attention to a female-centric cartoon this inviting in a long period of time,  even if it's just to sell more of those cutesy toys,  unfortunately. I take my victories where I can get them!

Minor correction. I believe Faust has stated that her target audience was a lot wider than just "young girls".

            It certainly doesn't feel like a "half-hour toy commercial",  to me.
<p></p>Also,  I had a thought: do ponies use glue? And what is it made of in their world?

            Found this on the Elmer's website.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Elmer's Glues are chemical based. They are made or formulated from chemicals which are synthesized (created by Man). These chemicals were originally obtained or manufactured from petroleum,  natural gas and other raw materials found in Nature.

<p></p>I don't think we generally use horses for glue anymore. They probably use something else.
<p></p>That said,  the connection (like cat to violin strings) is there in the cultural mind,  so I doubt they'll try to leave any scene focusing on glue for too long lest kids get the wrong idea.

            Faust says that the show was aimed at young girls and their parents. Which includes male parents. As such,  going from there to adult males who aren't parents (and likely won't be parents anytime soon) isn't that much of a stretch,  she reasoned.

            Oh,  some of the first (?) series was totally a commercial without shame. They threw new random pony types in for the sake of toys. Hell,  I think they even called the babies something along the line of newborn twins,  because that's what the stores called 'em. They just needed a pony called Price Sticker.
