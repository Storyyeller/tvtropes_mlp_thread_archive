            I actually like it a lot :3
<p></p>Thinks I like the most:
<p></p>1. Spike's expressions. Especially (for some weird reason that I don't even know) all of the moments where his cheeks are swollen.
<p></p>2. Guard in a new kind of armor! I wonder what role the guards wearing that suit is?
<p></p>Oh,  those are the Archive guards. And oh my goodness,  they're actually <em>armed!</em>

            Yeah it was a YMMV episode,  just because you personally don't like it doesn't mean someone else couldn't personally,  I found it rather average.
<p></p>I think a large problem is there are so many stupendous episodes that we tend to forget just how good even the mediocre episode really are when compared to most of the other stuff on TV.

            @Fallen: Haven't started yet,  actually.  Freaking take home midterm.  I'll get on it this evening.
<p></p>Short story: it's basically a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForFun" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForFun">Just for Fun</a> episode; no real groundbreaking characterization,  but no glaring issues either.  From a technical standpoint it's not the best episode because it's rather rushed,  but I still found it a ton of fun to watch.
<p></p>And yeah,  I can only think of 3 or 4 people on here who disliked it.  Everybody else seems to be positively deposed to the episode.

            Ahh... latest episode was amusing. Twilight running around in a panic is apparently so common,  that the guards and Celestia consider her sneaking around in a crazy get-up as an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight">Unusually Uninteresting Sight</a>.
<p></p>Also,  Terminator reference~ &lt;3
<p></p>Interesting that they included Tartarus into the lore of the world in an offhand scene. Though it's likely that Tartarus here is only a prison that Celestia and Luna use for monsters and ancient gods,  one can't help but wonder if it also serves its more popular function as the place where bad ponies go after they die.

            That was a pretty amusing story,  on various levels.  First of all,  it was rather funny in itself (ponies seem to be at their goofiest when they're sleep-deprived),  but I think I was most amused by the irony of Twilight scaring herself because she was trying to tell herself NOT to be scared.  I also like the general lesson and theme at the end about how "the future" eventually becomes the present,  as shown with Spike's problem from overeating.  It made me think about how there are at least several stories that were intended to be set in the far future when they were first created,  but are now either in the present or have turned into the past (like that one story in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a> set in the year 2010).

<p></p>Spot on. This is the only episode where those idiots at SA complaining that we bronies pay too much tribute to what,  ultimately,  is "just a kids show",  would have a point. This episode felt like something out of an average kid's show: something <em>not worth my time</em>.

            So... what's the deal with that scar?
<p></p>She got it from a paper cut? Either that's the mother of all paper cuts or Twi was VERY observant to notice a miniscule scar over all the other weird shit about Future!Twi
