            I did like Look Before You Sleep,  but I think it works a lot better when you already have a feel for the character.  That and AJ kinda has a point about Rarity being too detail oriented. It's still one of my favorite episodes,  though.

            I only realized that Rarity was my favorite a long while after the episode that convinced me aired. And currently she's tied with Rainbow Dash for my favorite,  with everyone else <em>really</em> close behind. My rankings are more or less useless. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            The main difference is that I liked Suited For Success the first time I watched it.  Look Before You Sleep didn't make much of an impression on me until I watched it again.

            It is true then that Rarity's episodes are the best overall?  I think so.

            I liked Look Before You Sleep for the Applejack and Rarity chemistry,  I love two characters bouncing off each other's key flaws like that. Suited For Success was her first individual episode however,  where we got a lot more of her acting and personality quirks as a lone character. I think every pony was rounded best after they got their center spotlight episode.
<p></p>Granted the first episode I saw with a notable Rarity role was Secret Of My Excess,  which seems to be very popular for some reason...I wonder why...
<p></p>@Applelight: Hard to say. Each character has at least one great leading episode. I like a lot of Twilight's however,  they seem to have more diversity,  rather than rotating too much around one same personality trait for a formula (maybe a downside for one's like Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash,  though are still usually good).
