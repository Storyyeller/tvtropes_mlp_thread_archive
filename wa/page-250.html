As for fan fics I'll probably write one as MLP is similar in setting and protagonist to one of my own original <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IPs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IPs">I Ps</a>,  and the last time that happened I did a Generator Rex/Light and Dark x-over. So a Tokusatsu/MLP x-over seems inevitable.

            I write fanfics too,  and I'm planning out one that has the more "epic" feel of the pilot episodes. Basically Celestia sends one of her guards to Ponyville on indefinite leave because she notices that he doesn't really like being a guard. He meets the <span class="strike">main</span> <em>mane</em> group and when Celestia comes to visit another unicorn/pegasus/earth pony that's basically their brother that was basically <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a> comes and takes over Canterlot with ambitions of taking over all of Equestria,  so the main group has to go along and fight to take Canterlot back.

            Fanpoetry. That'll be a first for Equestria Daily,  I think.
<p></p>Meanwhile,  I've been slowly tapping out a story of my own. The disappointing part is how I have to struggle to generate any output now. Compared to when the idea first struck me,  and I managed 2000 words in a single day. Then again,  this would probably be the part where I have to watch out for sneaky <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHoles" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHoles">Plot Holes</a>.

            I'm writing my Human in Equestira story starting from the other side.
<p></p>Basically,  I'm writing the intro like a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMesaCommute" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMesaCommute">Black Mesa Commute</a>.  Everything's fine in Ponyville until BAM,  something weird happens.
<p></p>It helps to provide contrast to the rest of the fic.

t depends dude.  Are you looking for an epic-tier fic with a long plot,  extreem character development and so on?  Cuz I've seen stories like that take YEARS to write.
<p></p>But its worth it.

            I wonder if MLP is suitable for a Methods of Rationality style fanfic. The problem I see is that there isn't enough continuity in the original,  so there isn't anything to base new plots on.

            Part of what makes Methods so damn funny is that the Harry Potter franchise routinely breaks the rules of logic,  AND IS SERIOUS ABOUT IT!  Ponies KNOWS it makes no logical sense,  and it doesn't TRY to.
<p></p>Hell,  there was an entire EPISODE devoted to lampshading how much sense it DOESN'T make.
<p></p>The fact that they lampshaded the fact that the ponies are naked proves that the creators know this isn't a serious show.
<p></p>So,  a Methods-style fic wouldn't work

            Hello one and all! I am NOT going through every single page of this thread,  but I would like to take the time to declare my love for ponies here on TV Tropes.
<p></p>In fact,  its partly why I'm here. I've been a long time troper lurker for some time,  but my current obsession with ponies has driven me to join the troper community at large (confound them! The ponies,  that is).
<p></p>So Yeah ...Ponies are awesome!

            Coincidentally I was considering joining in on Equestria Daily's latest Friend off. I haven't done MLP fan fiction before,  and I figure it might help me get out of a writer's block I've been having for a long time,  and I have this itching to write about Lyra...
<p></p>I just need to figure out who drew this picture! Give credit where credit is due!

            @Kyler As said above,  it varies,  although I can at least offer my own experience.  I wrote a draft for an original story that was kind of a big,  epic adventure type of thing.  It was big enough that if I were to ever get it good enough to try to publish in some way (fat chance,  though),  it would have to be 3 or more likely 4 novels.  To give you a bit of a gauge,  just the first draft plus one,  maybe two revision rereads per chapter took me about 8 or 9 months to complete.  A couple things to keep in mind,  I guess something to keep in mind is that I didn't spend all my free time on it,  but at the same time,  looking back at the writing,  I made a lot of mistakes,  like rushing the story too much and being a little scarce or whimsical on description (especially toward the end),  so if it was a pony equivalent story,  I wouldn't feel comfortable submitting it to ED.
<p></p>EDIT: Oops,  was going to comment on the ED hits too.  At this rate,  by the time season 2 rolls around,  we might be looking at a 100 million milestone.
