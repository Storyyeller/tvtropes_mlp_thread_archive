            @Mullon: Well there's ponibooru,  that's the one I go to. But that one has a fuckton of images,  so it might be a little overwhelming. Besides,  that's more about original fan art stuff than macros (though they do have a fair share of them) I'd recommend that you start here: <a class="urllink" href="http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/list/macro/60">http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/list/macro/60<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

            She lied through her teeth about <em>everything.</em> Particularly that "Anything you can do I can do better" boast. As the Recap page for the episode pointed out,  she shows no skill in what Rainbow Dash,  Applejack,  and Rarity challenge her in,  she merely interferes with their own parts with her magic. If nopony in the audience noticed that,  I'd be surprised.

That's just because Tricksy is so much better than all those posers.  She's even better at posing.

            But it didn't even look like she beat the challenge.  All it looked like was that she was forcing the others to fail.  Using magic to replicate the same results would have been fair game,  but just undercutting your opponent isn't good showmanship <em>or</em> good sportsmanship.
<p></p>I'm not saying she's evil or a bad person,  she's just overly proud of what is,  by all accounts,  an average talent in magic.  She has a good flair for the dramatic and she's a good storyteller; if she applied herself properly,  she could do well as a traveling entertainer whose schtick wasn't entirely 'I am better than everyone in this town'.

<p></p>She had above average magic ability I'm sure. She was precise with her telekinesis,  somehow able to turn rainbows into whirlwinds,  turn hair into grass and Summon thunderstorms. Other than Twilight,  no other unicorn has shown off that kind of power,  and ponyville seemed impressed by her for the most part

            On a personal level,  I think that Trixie had a pretty serious inferiority complex (I've got about three pages worth of writing on this for a fic I never did,  but I'll give you the readers digest version here).
<p></p>First of all,  from her performance she almost seemed like she <em>wanted</em> hecklers. If we assume that Rarity isn't being a sort of jerk here,  and that pony culture looks down on immodesty (which it seems to,  at least a bit),  it seems like pumping oneself up like that is asking for trouble. She wanted the chance to prove herself <em>against other ponies</em>. That's her idea of a show.
<p></p>Secondly,  As many people have pointed out,  she didn't truly beat RD,  AJ and Rarity,  she just made them look bad. Now,  as someone who was picked on for a while,  I can tell you it's easy for a victim of abuse to see 'strength' as being defined by your ability to hurt others. Now,  consider the equivalent in terms of magic - if a 'strong' wizard were to repeatedly use their magic to humiliate Trixie,  she could easily come to equate skill with the ability to humiliate someone.
<p></p>On the whole it seems likely that Trixie was at one point the bottom half of a rivalry - with a very,  very nasty rival. She feels the need to prove herself,  be it to herself or just to anyone who's watching,  that she is skilled - an a performer is a good venue for that. Given how she reacts to adulation(quite negatively,  off the stage) she's probably looking for acceptance from another skilled unicorn.
<p></p>Okay,  so yeah,  it's probably a biiiiiiig stretch,  but the signs are all there. It's interesting to think about,  at the very least.
