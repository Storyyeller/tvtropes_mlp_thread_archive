            He wasn't banned for talking about his issues,  he was banned for a combination of personal attacks and attention whoring by claiming that he was going to hurt himself.  Not to mention that he was kinda on thin ice to begin with as it wasn't the first time he had gotten into trouble with the mods.  His drama stuff was more of a "straw that broke the camel's back".  As long as you don't try to continually derail the thread to be about your issues it probably isn't a problem.  Although I'd still recommend not going into too much detail just to be on the safe side.

            Today,  I went to Star Buck and got an apple gran muffin.  I couldn't eat the whole thing there because I was full from dinner,  so I finished it at home.  I had a half-eaten muffin in my pocket on the way back.  Derp a derp!

            Self-harm? Pfft,  I did that once,  one time a long time ago,  regretted it. I am battling with depression but that seems to be a very common thing on teh interwho.

            AJP threatened suicide twice and used the N Word. I think he also posted personal details of someone from another site,  though most of the worst stuff got thumped before I could see it.
<p></p>Anyway,  math is awesome. Unfortunately,  there are always parts that are hard to understand. I've been trying to teach myself Differential Galois Theory,  but despite looking at a book for weeks,  I still don't understand the first chapter!
<p></p>Also,  I usually eat muffins every day for breakfast,  so it's not really special to me.

            Differential Galois Theory is like regular Galois theory except with differential equations instead of polynomials.
<p></p>Remember in calculus where they say that the normal distribution has no elementary antiderivative? Well this is supposed to be how you prove that.
<p></p>Incidentally,  Galois managed to invent an entire branch of math while younger than I am. Though at least I'm almost certainly going to outlive him.
<p></p><em>Man,  its been years since I've had a math class. I feel like I've probably forgotten everything. </em>
<p></p>You don't learn anything useful in math classes. If you actually want to learn math,  you need to do it outside of school. Wikipedia is a good place to start.
