            @Seraphem: That's true,  but still,  leaving a hole in the story and then retconning in an answer later isn't really a great storytelling method.  It <em>can</em> work if you want intentional ambiguity,  but I'm not sure that that was the case here.

<p></p>And yeah,  the first Dune book is the best because there was actually a plot other than "everyone is scheming and then something happens for some reason".  The second one kinda lost itself in all the machinations.  But hey,  at least the series gave us Sandworms.

            Eh i don't see it as a hole either way. not stating a characters motivation == them not existing. yeah not great stroytelling to do so unless there's a reason you need to keep it secret,  but not a plot hole unless not knowing it makes something not makes sense compared to their other actions.

            @ Lurker,  given the the important Character parts are written separately from the porn parts,  not hard to just edit those paragraphs out and keep the important stuff. And either way,  like i said,  not learning Homages motivations for a relationship with Pip was never a plot hole to begin with. bad writing,  possibly,  plot hole no.

            @Seraphem Then at least you can understand my problem here. The story is filled with these leaps of logic that are never elaborated on,  and the reader is just expected to get it. Some do,  and they're the big fans,  and some don't. As you said,  it's bad storytelling,  and there should be nothing wrong not liking a story because of that.

            @ J teeth agreed,  but it's really not that big a deal in his case that not knowing really alters stuff,  the only place the CD parts of 20.5 come into play in a big way is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Homages reactions to Arbu,  and lil'pips reactions to her reaction et al. </span> and that was written LONG after 20.5 was written and accepted as canon.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> Agreed,  i actually like not having everything always explained in a nice neat package as long as what is missing can be inferred or it's clear there is something there that would make sense if we knew. but yeah not for everyone. And sometimes the writer can slip and not include something important. I just don't think that homages motivations were that big a deal that not including them was a plot hole. And not having every little detail makes a lot of snese for the story given that all we know is what Lil'pip knows,  and nothing else. It's just a limitation inherent to the frame of reference choosen.

            @ Veni you're missing out,  yeah we squabble about the little things with FOE but overall it is a great story,  yes it has some issues and could use a professional editor to give it a once over,  but the core of the story is amazing. And the early chapters really are the worse,  it gets MUCH better quickly after chapter 5-6 and just keeps growing from there

Froggy Bottom is a soggy place tough to grow crops in,  and its infested with Hydras and presumably flies (which the frogs swarm to F.B to feast on presumably),  and Ghastly Gorge is a treacherous network of canyons and tunnels inhabited by Quarry Eels.
