            Actually,  I'm just gonna rank that Orchard levitating scene as my most hated moment in the entire series.

            I've honestly sort of discontinuitied the orchard levitation.  It was the end of the episode,  they were wrapping things up,  and they were just showing quick shots of the cast helping.  I just took it as visual shorthand.  We've seen Twilight helping on other occasions without doing the entire job herself.

            @ Ginger And? point we're making is,  yes she may be OP,  but she never becomes either a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a> or a <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuesExMachina" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuesExMachina">Dues Ex Machina</a>. If ALL your looking at is her magical power then yeah,  but the ponies are far FAR to faceted and complex to just focus on one aspect. Nopony ever treats Twi special,  ok except for becoming Celstia's personal student,  but even then nopony treats that as special either,  and Twi never acts superior about it.

            <div class="quoteblock"> when have they not used powers they could have which would have ended the story?  </div>
<p></p>When Twilight was being attacked by the Hydra,  she didn't teleport away.  That time she got tied up,  she didn't teleport out of it.  When they were chasing AJ in The Last Roundup,  she could have lifted the wagon wheels off the ground to stop them getting away,  or teleported herself into AJ's wagon.  There was a whole bunch of other times teleportation would have solved a dilemma.  In the last episode,  Twilight could have vastly improved their production by harvesting the apples herself (as Ginger is quick to note).
<p></p>Nothing else comes immediately to mind,  but I do remember lots of episodes when I thought of some power one of the character had that they could have used at the time.  I've only watched most episodes once though,  so I don't have a really great memory of them all.
<p></p>I bet I've been ninja'd so many times this post will be rendered meaningless.

            @Ginger: AJ's job encompasses <em>all things involving apples</em>,  just because Twilight happens to be good at that particular aspect of the job doesn't mean that Twilight is better at farming,  cooking,  selling apples.  Just because she can move apples from a tree to a basket easily doesn't mean that she's good at any of the million other things that AJ does.  It doesn't undermine AJ's entire purpose <em>at all</em>.  AJ's job is to farm and sell apples.  Twilight is good at precisely one step of the entire process.
<p></p>It's like assuming that AJ is better at magic than Twilight because she can read faster.

<p></p>and ok,  Twi does seem to forget she could teleport quite often,  wonder how EXACTLY that spell works...maybe there's a reason.

            Just cause Twilight can harvest a bunch of Apples doesn't mean she can run an Orchard full time.
<p></p>Anyway for the next episode if it turns out that Dash's fears are completely irrational I will be annoyed. For me it is just painful to watch a character be scared about something like that,  only for it to turn out to be nothing.

            And to be fair,  the entire apple picking process is absurdly simple compared to real life.  Just kick the tree and they all fall conveniently into the basket,  none on the ground at all.  Its really the simplest part of AJ's job,  ant there's no reason to get worked up about it.

            And not pictured: The time it took to seperate out the various twigs and stems and things that would be caught up in a mass-levitation spell like that,  that wouldn't have to be dealt with if they were just shaken off the tree.
<p></p>Why do you think she went with stacking and calculating in this most recent episode? Applejack and Fluttershy were much more capable of clean shake-downs. Twilight would have just made quality control <em>more</em> of a bottleneck.

            Ginger,  you really need to care less about what other people choose to focus on.  Even if AJ isn't the flashiest pony she still has fans,  and it isn't like the show is going to cut back on AJ because Twilight has more fans or whatever.  Hell,  the Apple family has had more focus than anyone else this season.

            Eh. I don't mind that scene,  AJ does have more work to do than just that. Plus that wasn't even her job,  it was Big Macintosh's and she was just doing it because he was sick/injured.

            @Crow It's easy for you guys to say that,  since the characters you focus on don't suffer the same problem. It's nice to feel validated every once in a while by the community you're a part of. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">
