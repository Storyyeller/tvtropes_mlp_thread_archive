            Following on from a earlier post of mine of things in the episode likely to appear in fanfics,  I've found another one. Fanfics based around the idea that Sombra can't actually talk properly.
<p></p>Crystal pony slave:"Sire,  what would you have us do?"
<p></p>Sombra:<strong>"Rarw Grr Naarg Woor Cryyyssstall!"</strong>
<p></p>Crystal pony slave: "Okay..."

            The Doylist explanation is obviously that the elements are getting old. As for Watsonian,  maybe the Changelings nicked them.

            @Mio Good point. We never got to see what they would have done,  however,  so my theory might have some standing still,  if we're willing to attribute the attempt to use the elements to a lack of better ideas,  although that may be grasping at straws.
<p></p>And if the Watsonian vs Doylist debate comes up again,  I'll just say the Doylist explanations lack entertainment value to me,  so I try to come up with Watsonian ones.

            Heh reminds me of a line from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheElenium" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheElenium">The Elenium</a> a old semi-senile religious leader of a group of well basically the most stereotypically played totally-not-Islamic extremists (this was years before 9/11 and it was clearly played out that it was just the extremists,  not the general population that were this way.) He wanted to tell his troops "Fall on you foes" and it came out sounding more like "Fall on your Swords" s half his army killed themselves mid battle.

            So I watched the S3 starter episodes and I must say... I though it was good.
<p></p>The gags in the two parters,  the ones with Pinkie Pie esepecially,  were really quite funny. This has been the first time in ages since I found Pinkies antics funny rather than annoying. The party cannon gag and Pinkiespy were hilarious,  as well as the dialouge swapped between Rarity and Applejack when the Faux Crystal Heart was discovered by the Crystal Ponies. I was laughing at the scene with the GRAVITY STAIRS (I TOLD YOU BRO,  I WARNED YOU DAWG) for different reasons :p.
<p></p>I found the crystal ponies endearing. The Librarian Pony is probably my favorite minor character in the series so far,  I found her rather cute.
<p></p>I also really liked the songs in the 2 parter. Especially the reprise of the Failure/Success Song. And the animation was phenominal.
<p></p>I had a few problems with this episode.
<p></p>Firstly,  Sombra.
<p></p>When I first saw Sombra. I thought he was going to be some serious shit. I though that he would have and epic showdown with the Mane 6,  Cadence &amp; Shining Armor. The Episode also does a fantastic job of building him up to be a potent threat. Then when the major showdown is to take place... He blows up due to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a> and his remains spread across the land.
<p></p>Yes. Sombra fell victim to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlackCauldron" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlackCauldron">Horned King Syndrome</a>,  and that really irritates me. I really hope he comes back,  becausehe wasn't given any time to ham it up.
<p></p>Secondly,  the use of Cadence and Shining Armour.
<p></p>I seriously forgot these two were there during the course of the episode,  and I found that the scenes that they did have were rather... rushed. I guess that's a good thing because it was really Twilight's Episode,  but I kinda wished I could see those two exist outside of being plot devices.
<p></p>Overall,  I liked it,  could have been better,  but I liked it. I really hop the Crystal Empire and Sombra come back in the furture.

There would be a lot more panic about the enemy now having control of the county's magical superweapons. Probably would have made for a interesting episode though.
<p></p>I still hope the elements will come up again sometime.

            @Mio: It also might be an issue of practicality.  With Chrysalis,  the Elements were right there and with Celestia out of action they didn't really have many other options.  It was basically a last ditch attempt.  In this case,  they had other methods at their disposal.  It entirely possible that if the deal with the heart failed,  Luna would have just airdropped the elements to them.  The other thing is that Celestia might be reluctant to send the Elements out of the country.  They're Equestria's last-resort superweapon and she might not be too keen on sending them to the arctic north if there was any possibility of a threat arising at home.

Though they were still sending the only ponies who could use said weapons into another country,  rendering said weapons little more then pretty paperweights. So that last point is kind of moot.
<p></p>I still think it might have been good to send it with them as a last resort,  but I guess that the whole "only you can do it" is better emphasized if the literal power of friendship was left at home (even if it was still kind of needed<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">).

            <div class="quoteblock">Pre-part 2 speculation. I am 85% sure that Cadence's butt-tattoo is the actual Crystal Heart. Which Twilight would have known if the last page weren't missing. </div>Yes,  it is. She's even called the Crystal Princess. Wait...
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess"> Cadence is possibly even older than Luna and Celestia. She was the original monarch of the Crystal Empire/Kingdom before Sombra took over. As a result of his rule and the subsequent vanishment of the city she lost her power and appeared as a filly for millennia (like Luna did after being blasted with Harmony Beam). She began regaining her power and growing up only recently,  signifying that the empire would soon return. That's why the guards knew what 'it' was (as they most definitely won't be old enough to remember even the legends). All three princesses knew the signs and were waiting. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">

            Regarding the Hot Topic stuff - the crystal ponies both carry a Licensed by Hasbro logo. I think they said that those won't hit the other retailers for 4-5 months. The Derpy also carries a licensed by Hasbro logo and is distributed by Funko. And everything else - yes - the trading cards even have a thing where each pack has a contest card with a code to enter online (prizes include more packs of cards,  and cards signed by the voice actors.)
<p></p>For the record,  certain of the stuff can also be ordered directly from Hot Topic's website,  for those who don't have one in their area.

            There are two threads because there's a spoiler and a non-spoiler - spoiler was started last month for those that wanted to talk about info that was already released for the season three premiere.
<p></p>Or if you mean the one about non-<em>Friendship is Magic</em> pony stuff,  I suppose that was a natrual outgrowth.
