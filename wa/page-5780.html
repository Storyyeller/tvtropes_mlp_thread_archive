            Okay,  here we go. Took me a little while to type this up,  and there are still plenty of things to work out,  but it's a start.
<p></p>First draft of basic character creation:
<p></p>As in most D20 systems,  characters have six attributes: Strength(STR),  Dexterity(DEX),  Constitution(CON),  Intelligence(INT),  Wisdom(WIS),  and Charisma(CHA).
<p></p>Actions that require the usage of some skill must pass a check by rolling a D20 against a target value that varies depending on the difficulty of the check. The the amount of points devoted to attributes relevant to the task determine how much you add or subtract to the roll. 10 points in an attribute gives no bonuses or penalties. For every two points above 10,  a character gains +1 to any relevant checks. For every <em>single</em> point below 10,  a character takes a -1 penalty to relevant checks (harsher penalties discourage stat-dumping).
<p></p>There are no "classes" for ponies to choose from. Instead,  characters have to make two initial selections: Race,  and Cutie Mark. They will then be able to select from a pool of Skills (AKA Feats,  for D&amp;D vets out there) that they meet the requirements for.
<p></p>Skills are divided into six groups,  one for each attribute (though some Skills may be accessible by two or more attributes). For each level a character gains,  they get three Skill Points,  which may be spent to learn new Skills. By default,  most Skills cost four points to learn,  though this cost can be lowered. Some skills also have prerequisites,  requirements that must be reached before the skill may be learned. These requirements can be anything from a minimum attribute,  to having another specific skill to build from,  to having first-hoof experience in a subject. Some skills are classified as "Magic" skills,  in addition to their attribute. These skills can normally only be learned by Unicorns (though there are some exceptions).
<p></p>A pony's Cutie Mark portrays their calling in life and what they are skilled in. As such,  what cutie mark a pony has determines the difficulty of learning new Skills. Each Cutie Mark has one Major Attribute and two Minor Attributes that it is aligned with. Skills aligned with a pony's Major Attribute only cost two Skill points to learn,  and Skills aligned with a Minor Attribute cost three skill points. The Cutie Mark itself may be any image you want,  so long as it represents that pony's attributes.
<p></p>Race decides what type of pony the character is (Earth Pony,  Pegasus,  or Unicorn),  each of which have their own strengths and advantages.
<p></p>Pegasi are defined by their wings,  and their connection with the air around them. By default,  Pegasus characters gain the exclusive Basic Flight Skill and the Magic Skills Cloud Walking and Cloud Shaping for free.
<p></p>Unicorns are ponies with horns that can focus their magical energies to manipulate the world around them. They gain the Magic Skill Basic Telekinesis for free,  and are capable of learning any Magic Skill that they meet the requirements for.
<p></p>Earth Ponies may not be as flashy as the other two races,  but they make up for it with practicality and utility. Earth Ponies start with more points to be assigned to attributes than the other two races,  as well as one free Skill of their choice that is aligned with their Cutie Mark's Major Attribute and they meet the requirements for.
<p></p>Thoughts?

            That's why you never play wizard. Or if you do,  at least have the common sense to prep your spells beforehand.
<p></p>This reminds me of a conversation I had with some friends a while back,  actually. They were telling me about a session of their's,  and they started dick-waving their characters a bit.
<p></p>Friend 1: Oh,  please. You play a fairy. A goddamn fairy! I play a dragon born,  I'd eat you alive.
<p></p>Me: Wait: [friend 2],  what class are you?
<p></p>Friend 2: Sorcerer.
<p></p>Me: [friend 1]?
<p></p>Friend 1: Ranger
<p></p>Me: Yeah,  you're fucked [friend 1]. His fairy's gonna kick your ass.
<p></p>Wonder what the pony equivalent of a situation like that would even be? All I know is that it severely tempts me to build a character with almost no apparent fighting power,  but spec him in a way that he just dances around fights without ever getting hit. Or a Cleric who buffs themselves out the ears and just lets attacks bounce off them.

            I started on D&D 3.5 and then moved to pathfinder when my DM bought the books (it really is better).  Now I think I'm going to quit though. All my previous complaints about time still stand,  and now my DM is starting a horror campaign.

            I just had a great idea for a new skill:
<p></p><strong>Take 23</strong> (<em>rouges only</em>)
It's just like taking 20 except more brazen.
