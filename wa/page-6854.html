            I honestly think she could live without magic. There's got to be more to her than that,  surely? We've SEEN that there's more to her than that. Hell It's the reason she's my 2nd favourite pony

            That's a point.  Twilight did have to go without magic in the first half of Return of Harmony and <strong>it went terribly</strong>.   Admittably that was all Discord but still.
<p></p>I was planning an ace attorney type deal with a Donkey lead,  but had to derail it a lot when donkey's showed up in canon.

            I think an episode where her magic malfunctions and she has to make do without it for a while would be more in line with the show's tone. Read It And Weep comes to mind as a Rainbow Dash equivalent.

            There is plenty of stuff that the rest of the cast can do that Twilight cannot. She doesn't have Applejack's strength,  stamina,  or botanical knowledge. She doesn't have Pinkie's memory or boundless confidence. She doesn't have Rarity's fine control or technical knowledge. She doesn't know animals like Fluttershy does. And she certainly can't fly.

            Except that there have been <em>very</em> few situations that Twilight could have solved with her magic and she didn't. As we've said before,  Magic can't solve friendship problems.

            Well,  Applejack's cooking is becoming more renowned,  and as Bag pointed out RD is definitely getting better. She can do the rainboom on command now,  let alone one fighting gravity.

            RD has shown marked improvement in both her flying and leadership skills. In fact,  I think she's taken the initiative to lead just as much if not more so than Twilight this season. If it weren't for the fact that Twilight is more or less the main character,  I wouldn't be surprised if the show was building up to RD being the go-to leader. Though,  if they did do that,  it wouldn't be <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XiaolinShowdown" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XiaolinShowdown">the first show to pull that kind of bait and switch</a>.
