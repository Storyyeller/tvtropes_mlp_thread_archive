            Yeah,  it feels more like a case-by-case job of helping ponies who have nightmares instead of seeing everyone everywhere at once.

            I know that the series is less than definitive about the power level. But I think that my position is a reasonable one based on what we know.
<p></p>@Kegi: I think that the series' power level is higher than Perpetual Lurker does. I can go into specifics if you want.

            @Sereg Yeah,  and? Where did I say that she only enters Scootaloo's dreams? It's quite a leap to go from "Luna enters dreams" to "Luna enters every dream at once." I'd say that the implication is that she simply seeks out nightmares caused by deeper troubles and offers guidance.

            Oh,  this debate again.  Okay.
<p></p>My opinion is on record,  but I'll say it again once more - I'm much more in line with Lurker's viewpoint than Sereg's,  which I view as overblown to the point that it would invalidate most of the adventurous deeds in the show.

            Okay,  yes,  "Patrols" is a better word. Same basic idea,  though.  She goes through the dreams individually rather than appearing in all of them at once,  which I agree isn't really shown in the show and would be (to me at least) too much of a jump in power level.
<p></p>TL;DR I lean on Red and Perpetual's side of this one because I tend to assume that they don't have an uberpowerful ability like that unless they demonstrate it in the show,  and I don't think Luna or Celestia ever have.  I agree with Sereg insofar as the show doesn't explicitly invalidate his theories,  but at the same time I don't see any reason to assume that she has a particular ability unless the show confirms it.

            @ Red: Why does Luna being able to enter all the dreams say that would happen? To answer your question,  because that would show weakness to the dragon nation. If just one napping dragon gets the sovereign of the nation personally involved it shows that dragons are more important than ponies. On the other hand sending your student and a few of her friends shows that dragons aren't that important.

<p></p>A: What Ace said.
<p></p>B: Dragons have been<em>demonstrated</em> to be <em>far</em> more powerful than they look (see Spike).
<p></p>@Perpetual Lurker: She said that it was her <em>duty</em> to enter the dream<em>s</em> of her subject<em>s</em>.

<p></p>EDIT: Badwolf also makes a good point. Especially as I believe that the most powerful dragons are more powerful than Celestia.

            @Badwolf: Celestia's powers are more raw elemental in nature,  as far as my fanon goes. Most of it revolves around the Sun itself,  although she has put her power to work learning a large variety of spells to better harness her expanded magic scope. Thing is,  she usually suppresses her magic because unleashing too much power will be akin to making a Sun flare into existance,  and she doesn't want to toast her little ponies by accident.
<p></p>Suppressing her power level like that makes her vunerable to getting accidentally pwned by things like Chrysalis stuck in Hyper Mode because of her being hopped-up on Love.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> I suspect only Senior Dragons would pose a threat to Celestia,  but only up until she removes her limiter and bathes them in the full fury of the Sun's Power.

            @Ace: I believe similarly.
<p></p>EDIT: But I believe that Chrysalis <em>really was</em> stronger than Celestia at that point.
<p></p>EDIT:<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Yeah. I don't think Celestia can effectively fight the most powerful dragons. They're fireproof for a start. Never mind everything else.
<p></p>Anyway,  I don't see my views as jumpingto conclusions. I see others as jumping to conclusions in assuming that they are weak. But yeah. That's just how I see it.

            @Sereg I still don't see how a duty to assist in dreams in any way implies that she's in all of them at once.
<p></p>Out of curiosity,  though,  how is Spike demonstrably powerful? He's capable of some magic,  and he's mostly heat-proof,  but that's all I can think of.

            Her powers aren't swiss-army,  mind. I just imagine she has the raw magical power reserves to brute-force spells. Even Twi can't normally do that and has to practice them.
<p></p>@Sereg: That depends on how pure Shiny's love for Cadance would be in order to force-multiply her. Even Love can't measure up to the raw elemental force of the primal Sun unleashed. Stronger than Celestia under limiter,  definitely. Stronger than Celestia going all out without care for leaving a scorched,  glassed battlefield,  I seriously doubt that.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> I suspect Spike's magic is still immature,  but he <em>does</em> have massive physical damage resistance and nigh-immunity to exposed lava pits. He's still vunerable to magic damage from Twi and susceptible to indigestion caused by too much ice cream.
