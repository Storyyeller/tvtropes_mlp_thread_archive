            @Mousa I don't look at them <em>much</em>,  and I don't <em>enjoy</em> it,  but I've seen enough to know that your drawing of Spike is different from your normal work.  It's not because they're human,  though. It's because they're human versions of the ponies,  and it's just a strange neurosis on my part,  not yours. Your human style would actually make a great cartoon,  IMO,  thanks to the great care you've taken to giving each character distinct and recognizable body types.

            To back-up the statement that humans are much harder to draw,  I present myself: 23 years of humanoids.  One year of pony (albeit an intense everyday exercise compared to the more sporadic previous years).  My ponies make my humanoids look like a joke by comparison.  What do.

            @van A Dog and Pony Show? Personally,  that's my favorite single episode of the whole series. I'd rather equate the Diamond Dogs to Goblins than Gremlins,  though.
<p></p>EDIT: Nope,  Swarm of the Century. Yeah,  I guess the parasprites kind were like Gremlins,  in a way. I almost <em>never</em> use episode numbers,  so I always get confused when people do. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            Would you folks like to hear what my mother is like?
<p></p>I've been out most of the day with my friend,  helping him take care of the final preperations for his trip.  I came home and had a quick dinner.  She came in just as I finished the thing,  saw the dirty dishes and my shoes not put away in the closet,  just assumed that I hadn't bothered to left a finger around the house,  and flew off into a rant,  whereby she called me a lazy worthless shit who never does a thing around the house and I'm good for nothing.  I just let her rant herself out with a grin.  When she finished and asked what did I have to say for myself...I calmly explained where I had been.  She realised what a fool she had made of herself...then I said that I'm not so worthless whenever she needs money to take without permission,  or needs to get a lift home from the town whenever she's out drinking and can't get a taxi.  Then I told her what I told her before...she is a pathetic excuse for a human being,  and that I look forward to the day when I can cut her out of my life completely.  She's downstairs now,  quietly sobbing to herself.  She never learns...

            Humans are comparatively easy to say anything with a muzzle,  I mean there are humans everywhere,  we are them,  a few minutes in a mirror and you learn everything you need to know about what to do about that little problem along with general observations of anybody walking by and specifically zoning in on any fascinating or unique body parts or connects that allow you understand how something that looks so different is still identical in every body,  necks,  collar bones,  fingers,  cheekbones,  chins,  jawlines....
<p></p>If non-humans were so easy my I'd have far more progress in at least three of my story ideas than I do now.
<p></p>Fine,  I get it,  don't necessarily suck,  just plenty of room to improve... is... all.... God it's so impossible to believe it,  I don't know what's wrong with me,  it's like I can't believe anything positive about myself or what I do.

            I'd draw parallels between the parasprites and Tribbles rather than Gremlins.  Though they were more consciously destructive than Tribbles,  I guess.

            Applelight,  despite what she may have done to you recently,  I'm not sure your mother deserved tat.  After all,  she's still your mom and she must still care for you on some level.  Even if my mom had repeatedly used me,  or railed against me I don't think I could bring my self to hate her as much as you seem to hate yours.  Of course,  I've a relatively good relationship with the rest of my family,  so then again,  what I'd do might not apply.  Still,  perpetuating a cycle of revenge and hatred can't be healthy,  Applelight.

<p></p>Applelight,  for the moment,  you have my props. Maybe someday you can talk things out with your mom,  but for now you go ahead and enjoy the victory.

            Mousa: Seeing humans everyday is both a blessing in what you said and a curse.  The curse being that since we're all so familiar with the human form,  it's much more difficult to create something that is convincing to the human eye.
