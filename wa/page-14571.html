            On a diffrent note,  I've noticed something about grimdark fanfics: Out of any of the mane 6,  AJ is possibly the only one who hasn't gotten a infamous fanfic that derails her into either a psychopathic monster or at least very mentally insane {RD has Rainbow Factory,  Fluttershy has Pattycakes even though that fic might actually be a parody,  Pinkie has Cupcakes,  Twilight has Serving and Recconection along with some other fic that I can't remember,  and I'd rather not name the fic that did this to Rarity}. I guess that for once her more level-headed personality actually helps her,  huh?<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            The issue is that if you each he race how to love,  there's the real chance that a large faction will decide to just go out and find someone to love them back and live a life of self-sufficiency. You could easily lose a massive portion of your potential fighting force.

            They aren't a hive mind. The existence of individual generals in the Crhysalis faction's army is proof enough of that. The rank-and-file,  too,  show obvious signs of sapience and individual thought.

            I met Cheerilee once. Lovely girl,  until I showed her that fic.
<p></p>She didn't talk to me anymore after that,  and then some offical types roll up and say that I'm not allowed near kids anymore.
<p></p>There's no justice.
