            Actually I think I'm going to side with Ginger on this one. Despite them having ample warning about what was going to happen Rainbow really shows absolutely zero concern for their well being once it gets started. Not exactly the most endearing trait for a new pet owner.

<p></p>@Mio: I agree that she was a jerk in that way; I just don't think that the decision to have them go through the gorge in the first place was a bad one.  The execution was jerkish,  but the idea itself was logical.

            Meh,  I put in on the same league as a lot of RD moments,  she WAS being a jerk,  but a loveable unmalicious jerk.
<p></p>It's the same as she was for Applebloom in Call of the Cutie,  she doesn't get everyone else doesn't have the same talent and preferences she does. She just assumes everyone wants to do badass stuff like she does.

            Remember that <em>Fluttershy</em> was behind encouraging pets to participate. There is <em>no way</em> that they could have been pressured into doing it by anything other than their desire to be adopted. In fact,  Fluttershy kept Tank around in the competition because <em>Tank really wanted to be there</em>. All of them did.

            @Ginger I agree that that was the lesson. And the lesson was learned. Again,  I see no problem here.

            Right. She was going about it wrong. She was looking for the wrong qualities (like being a daredevil who would fly through that gorge) and overlooking others. And she chose something a bit too difficult for the last thing. Not that that actually <em>stopped</em> any of the participants who chose to do the gorge race.

<p></p>@Ginger: Right; she was looking for the wrong thing in a pet.  I totally agree with you there.  She was looking for the wrong thing.  However,  even if her goal was wrong,  the steps she took to get to that goal are logical.  Yes,  she has a wrong idea of what a pet is,  but given the idea that she <em>does</em> have,  the whole gorge thing makes sense.
<p></p>Also,  I updated my tumblr,  and the first chapter of my Applejack/Twilight story <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/31793/A-Delicate-Balance">is posted on Fimfiction<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for those who are interested.
