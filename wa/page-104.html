            I don't normally pay attention to the palette swaps,  but in this case they were palette swaps of the main ponies,  so it kind of stood out.

            I'm betting if we ever see the series end with a flash forward to them starting families,  we'll see them with unnamed males we haven't seen before. Spike is probably going to end up getting over his crush and spending the rest of his childhood with Twilight's family. (He's going to take a while to fully mature,  I bet.)
<p></p>Rarity might end up with Celestia's nephew in the end,  but we might have to wait for the season finale to figure out how likely that could be. He might be a total douche. Either way,  I don't think Rarity would be the type that would want to become an old maid.
<p></p>I can't imagine Applejack <em>not</em> wanting a husband and kids of her own at some point. She seems very much a family pony,  and they need a new generation to help run the farm. Caramel seems to be a friend of the family. I think he'd be the safest bet.
<p></p>I can imagine Rainbow Dash would end up single at that point- partly because a lot of fans like having her sexuality stay ambiguous,  partly because she doesn't seem like one for settling down- but she'd be a member of the Wonderbolts.
<p></p>We'd probably see Fluttershy ending up with someone just as shy as her,  and we'd be treated to x2 awkward interactions combo. Maybe a character with a comical fear of animals he'd have to get over?
<p></p>Pinkie Pie? Tough call. Maybe it'd be some poor <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArthurDent" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArthurDent">Arthur Dent-ish</a> pony that has trouble keeping up with her. In any case,  I'd bet she'd have a hell of a bachelorette party. The wedding'd probably be nuts,  too.
<p></p>Oh fuck,  I just wrote fan-fiction. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>It doesn't seem that right to me,  though. Seems like there'd be too many passive males,  but on the other hand it'd be kind of obnoxious to have new characters out of nowhere with personalities large enough to overshadow the mane 6.
<p></p>Hey waaaaaait. What about Braeburn and Pinkie? Might be kind of weird considering they didn't seem to have much chemistry,  but it seems like the most appropriate straight pairing for her so far.
<p></p>Wait,  what was I thinking for Fluttershy? I completely forgot about Big Macintosh. That'd just be hilarious.
<p></p>Might be kind of weird to see so many of them become part of the Apple clan.
<p></p>Hmm... having a hard time thinking of someone for Twilight. It's probably be too weird if she ended up with Snips or Snails even after they grew up and hopefully became a little less stupid. I think it might be fun if it was Dr. Whoof. I'm guessing a yet unseen fellow smarty-pants unicorn would work out.
<p></p>But I guess I'm kind of weird in that the only relationships I'd want to see would be ones that would make for a satisfying and plausible inclusion in the story. That doesn't seem to be the point of shipping at all.
<p></p>Fuck. I need to do homework.

            I notice something strange (it could be just me) when looking for pictures from last episode and listenig creepy music (like from Doom) some images got pretty creepy to.
Like Twilight stuff (especaly that Doctor Manehatan scene) or that Pony Liberty Statue from Manehatan (it eyes and face,  there is some thing wrong in this).

            We know the braodcast order and chronological order for these episodes aren't in synch. Surely somepony,  somewhere has arranged them in the correct order?
<p></p>While it is certainly true that Fluttershy didn't need the sonic rainboom to find her cutie mark,  she DID need to be present at the race,  otherwise she wouldn't have fallen down in the first place. Ergo,  if sompony goes back in time to screw with destiny their best move would be to prevent that race from taking place at all. Honestly I think having a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a> episode where we see how all the Mane cast would have grown up differently is totally something Lauren might consider for season 2.
<p></p>One last thing. I don't think Twilight's super explosion of magic was something that could just go of at anytime. She was clearly reacting to Destiny chosing her and her future friends to be the bearers of the elements of harmony due to the sonic rainboom uniting them all. That kind of thing doesn't happen every day.

Knowing the correct chronological order is nice and all,  but I'm interested in finding out <em>how</em> we know what the correct chronological order is. I need proof!
<p></p>(See my post in the other FIM thread.)

We knoe Fall weather friends had to happen before Winter Wrap-up. We may also be able to place a few other episodes based on the season they take place in. Apparently in Boast Busters there is a pony with green hair that gets offended by Rarity's remark about green hair looking bad. He shows up again in sereveral other episodes with orange hair. Some people take this to mean he started dying it. Then there is Celestia's appearances and the tickets to the Galla. How far in advance could they realistically give those out?

<p></p>And about G1 ponies,  I wish Rainbow mother look similar to Firefly  just like Twilight mother look similar to original Twilight.
That Lauren art of FF look really cool (but still prefer RD).

            Regarding Rainbow Dash's alleged Mary Sue status: In the context of that episode,  she acted as a symbol of a girl's strong-willedness and determination to make something out of herself. She is the one of the mane cast who most obviously displays ambition,  so they made it her quite literal "impulse" that pushed all the other ponies to realize their true desires.
<p></p>Something like that.
