            Ugh,  the theatrical ending in that movie was so dumb.  I guess the studio wanted more of an action climax regardless of if it made any sense or completely violated the ending of the book.

            @ Ace,  well supposedly the Badgers do have that flaw,  but it's more an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw">Informed Flaw</a>,  we're told that all male badgers suffer from blood wrath and a badger in the middle of it can't tell freind from foe,  but we never really saw that. Closest was Crega Rose-Eyes,  and that was less attacking her own troops,  as just not being as careful as she should be and driving them harder then she should.

            @ginger: Nah,  I saw a comic from the Vampire's perspectives(A canon one,  too). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Basically the vampires see themselves and other vampires as being normal humans - but the humans look like horrible monster to them,  something so ugly and frightening they're compelled to kill it,  usually for fear that it's attacking them.</span> So if they had the chance to run,  I see no reason they wouldn't take it.
<p></p>@Seraph: Oh,  I hadn't read that - I think I only managed to read about half the books. I need to find the rest still. But I remember one where the abbey adopted a weasel and tried to raise him. He was basically subject to prejudice from everyone but his mother(They named him EVIL for chrissake),  the good he did was ignored and the bad was used as proof they were right,  even when they basically bullied him into doing bad stuff. And then he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sacrificed his life to save his mother</span>,  even <em>she</em> took it as proof he was evil. I just... set the book down at that point.

            Pinkie would like 2,  Rarity might like five but overall would be put off by the fact not a single Doctor dresses tastefully except 3. Fluttershy would like 8 I think. RD might like actions oriented 3,  jerkass 6,  or hyperactive 10. Twilight would probably be more partial to the first and possibly 3rd doctors.

            I only saw the cartoons as a kid,  but loved them. It wasn't until I was older,  about 13,  that I found the first book(Martin the Warrior - it's still my favorite today). I still enjoy the books,  but yeah. They have some pretty serious issues. Good,  but still flawed. The ones that take place more away from the Abbey really stand out next to the crowd.
<p></p>@turtle: Yes,  and the only downsides are the inability to please one's partner,  the inability to have children,  no more sex,  reduced testosterone production meaning listlessness,  tiredness,  lower muscle density and,  depending on the person,  a persistent feeling of immasculation.
