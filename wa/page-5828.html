            Re: attributes
<p></p>So,  60 points distributed over 6 stats,  every 2 points above 10 gives a +1 bonus,  and every <em>single</em> point below 10 gives a -1 penalty? My gut tells me this will only <em>encourage</em> stat-dumping if anyone wants to start out with a decent (above-average) score in the attributes they care about,  since you don't want minuses all over your sheet. That,  or go totally Mario and make everything 10.
<p></p>Then again,  that might just be me. I have a tendency to intentionally make my character horrifically bad in one stat,  for flavor purposes.
<p></p>Re: Skills
<p></p>As I understand it,  Major skills cost 2,  Minor skills cost 3,  Unaligned skills cost 4,  and you normally start with 3. Okay,  so you can buy a skill aligned to your cutie mark right off the bat. Makes sense.

Well,  if not a 10,  all systems I've seen have some positive number they define as "average". (The <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfDarkness" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfDarkness">World of Darkness</a></em> system,  for example,  has it at 2 dots.) Because you can't have "average" without also having  "<em>below</em> average".
<p></p>Unless you're complaining more about the frequency of games that specifically use 10? In which case,  I would have to guess it's because of the popularity of the d20 system. D&amp;D <em>is</em> kind of the mainstream tabletop RPG so many homegrown systems are likely to take inspiration from that.

            Its mostly the fact that every <em>2</em> ranks grants you 1 bonus.  Why not just make it 1/1?  Then no one would have to think about it to remember what their bonus is.  11=+1,  12=+2,  and so on.  I still think it's best to start at 0 though.

            I can't say it's awkward,  but that's because it being the system I started on makes it feel the most normal for me. +1 for every single point feels awkwardly accelerated,  is what it feels like.
<p></p>Emphasis on feeling. Not saying one is better than the other,  objectively.
<p></p>I would assume years of playtesting the system (it did go through several revisions,  after all) resulted in that particular ratio?

            You asking about my system?  If so,  no,  from the beginning I just thought it was a much more natural way to do things.  Because in the traditional D&D system,  you often get 1 attribute point left over when making your character and you only get 1 attribute every 4 levels... and 1 attribute point is completely useless on its own.  I'd rather have it where each increase in attribute actually has a meaningful result.  Its just a matter of convenience.
<p></p>Anyway,  I need to go to bed.

            Um... I meant D&D going through several revisions. Sorry for the mixup.
<p></p>Yeah,  admittedly,  having an odd-numbered stat is kind of awkward in the d20 system. Does give you a bit of extra carrying capacity if you have it in STR,  though.

            Uh,  Ginger,  a Pony rp is totally going to be social-heavy,  so int/cha builds will have an edge in socializing,  but they'll have problems with physical work if they dump too much and let their str suffer.

Okay,  well,  it's inverted compared to what you guys are talking about,  but I was inspired to draw it while in a pony RP. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            Probably gonna have to repost this tomorrow when I get up,  but for you folks on the night crowd! I'd just recently finished working on a commission for somepony,  and <a class="urllink" href="http://i163.photobucket.com/albums/t289/kegisak/WhatMeetsTheEye.png?t=1333522620">Here she is<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>!
<p></p>Aside from a bit of wonkiness in the background,  I actually really like how it turned out. I'm... not so sure if the commissioner didn't like it; they didn't say one way or another and I can't really think of a polite way to ask. I hope they did at least; I'd hate to think I charged them for a product they didn't care for. I'd have been perfectly willing to rework something if they'd asked,  but...
<p></p>Eh,  oh well! I still think it turned out really well. And I actually managed to get some use out of the lighting course I was forced to take - The shadows are all very slightly blue,  creating an illusion where everything else seems to have a slightly orange tint.

Neat! I've always kind of liked the way you drew the muzzle on your ponies.
<p></p>The shadows look a little confused,  though,  direction-wise? The part behind the white stallion's head,  at least,  is throwing me off. /nitpick

            Thanks,  guys!
<p></p>... I just realized I didn't draw the brown Stallion's cutie mark... balls. I'll need to fix that tomorrow,  send the revised version to the commissioner. Oh well,  it's three in the morning right now. It can wait until tomorrow.

            Ah,  it's that blue-green wall that looks like an extension of the white brick/stone wall on the left. At least,  that's what it looked like until I noticed tiny little details that reveal that it's not actually part of the same wall.
<p></p>The angle of the shadow on it looked weird (in a "doesn't agree with the other shadows about the direction of the light source" kind of way) before I realized what I realized.
<p></p>...if that makes any sense?

<p></p>I'd probably grow a beard if I was a stallion,  but I'm a mare.
<p></p>Role play? I don’t know how good I’d be with that. I’m not a good actor.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad"> But I’d love to be unicorn!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin">
