            @Seraphem: Whether it's about their Cutie Marks or not,  there's still too much solidarity in the group.  Out of all the episodes that the CMC show up in,  pretty much none of them involve tension within the group.  It's always "The CMC vs. X",  where X is lack of cutie marks,  Diamond Tiara,  etc.
<p></p>I don't dislike them,  I just wish there was more variety in how they were used.  Sisterhooves Social and Stare Master are (for me at least) the best episodes featuring those characters because it was focused on character interaction and incorporated the mane cast rather than just isolating the CMC somewhere.

            Eh,  I think the mane thing we need in Season 3 is more full-ensemble episodes,  with like all six of the mane cast... or at least,  most of them.  I think that's part of the reason I didn't like Season 2 as much... the girls weren't together as often and some of them (like Pinkie Pie) <em>really</em> don't work when they fly soloâ€”they need to be part of a bigger whole.
<p></p>It's like a jigsaw puzzle.  Put all the pieces together and its a beautiful picture.  But if you have just one piece by itself,  its just a funny-shaped piece of cardboard that sort of resembles the Gingerbread Man.  Only not as tasty.

I can't remember,  but did she actually <em>explicitly</em> say that <em>Scootaloo</em> was getting a big episode role? (And no,  I am NOT taking "implied" for an answer.)
<p></p>Speaking of Scoots,  for some reason,  my mind is associating her with the chorus of Irene Cara's "Fame".

            IT seems to me like they were kind of preparing for a grander scheme of things,  and using this season to develop a supporting cast and world. In the next season we'll see more of the cast,  but they'll be able to be held up by some other characters as well. This will allow for more duo and focus type episodes,  where they won't need one another around to fill in the spaces. That will allow for more range in the conflicts. In theory,  at least. And even then,  whther or not that's a good thing is up for debate.
<p></p>For my part? I liked each season,  but they each had very distinct feels. And like the first season,  I found that the second season got better as time went on,  with a few spatterings of gold near the beginning. the golden episodes were all 18-onward for me.

            Pinkie is hit or miss; I think she worked pretty well in Baby Cakes,  but she drove me up the <em>wall</em> in "A Friend In Deed".  Seriously,  Pinkie,  personal space.

Which isn't to say that stuff like Family Appreciation Day or Hearts and Hooves Day was bad,  but I'd honestly rather have mane cast episodes.

            You know,  sometimes it seems like people are watching this show like it's a drama or a soap or something,  rather than a comedy. I mean,  yeah,  the characters are great,  but people rarely just want to sit back and be entertained for an episode. Not everything has to develop a character heavily,  so long as they get development somewhere down the line.

<p></p>You would think so,  but this doesn't always pan out.
<p></p>I think 30 minutes is more than enough to tell a decent story with good characterizations.  Making each episode 1 hour would probably lead to a lot of padding.

            I think the reason I don't see the problems people always bring up is that I don't and can't take the show seriously at all. The flaws people always point out are just not problems to me. The episodes I dislike are only because of characters I'm not a fan of.It's also the reason why I don't find darker stuff(like Red Velvet) or overly silly stuff (like Pinkie breaking the fourth wall in fanworks) odd. But I think we're done talking about problems we have with the show sometimes. Overall,  I think I liked Season 2 more,  just because they seemed more polished and better written to me.  <br> <br>CMC? I've always been a fan of them. Not sure why. After all,  I don't like kids.

            @Moe that's a good point tough by reading Jt's reviews sometimes they have to rush things to acomodate the episode.
<p></p>For instance Rarity's part on luna eclipsed had to be cut and mmm mystery had to rush at the end a bit too.

            Then a black hole forms.
<p></p>And yeah,  if there's any recurring issue,  it's that a lot of plots feel a bit rushed.  It's normally a very minor issue,  but it's probably the most pervasive.  Except for the odd duck like "It's About Time",  which had absurd amounts of filler.
