            My mother died slowly of a horrible disease over a decade,  leaving most of my memories of her s a blind quadroplegic. The insurance company only told us that she'd been rejected <em>after</em> her diagnosis,  so we were basically bankrupt. My father spent all his time working long hours to pay for her care,  looking after her,  searching for a cure and getting his MBA with which he hoped he'd get a promotion so he could afford to look after his family (he didn't. He was just given extra responsibilities with no rise in pay),  so I barely knew him until after her death. He remarried after three years and I could never meet my step-mother's expectations of me. I was suicidally depressed,  was bullied in school and had a couple of nervous breakdowns before the fights with my step-mother got so bad I had to leave the house. I only discovered I had Aspergers and therfore my reason for feeling so different in University. My masters was delied which screwed me out of a studentship for my Phd. Now I'm unemployed.
<p></p>That's a rough guideline of my life.
<p></p>EDIT:
<p></p>[[quoteblock]]maybe that's why some of them latched on to the show. they needed a bright spot. [/quoteblock]]
<p></p>This show is the only thing to have ever succeedied in making me feel joy. (I used to <em>think</em> I'd felt joy before. I was wrong.)

            It's mostly controversial because its first draft was really,  <em>really</em> rough,  the OC was a ridiculous Sue,  and most of the major plot developments happened when characters did some very uncharacteristic things — its initial fame was mostly from the My Little Dashie <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator">I WANT FEELS NAO</a> crowd.  Since then it's been extensively rewritten twice now,  it's considerably more believable for the effort,  and most of the drama over it is leftover from people who didn't know/care that the author actually responded to feedback and fixed most of its issues over time (certainly the most grating ones).
<p></p>IMO it's a good example of an author finding his feet over time.  It was actually really cool to watch a cringeworthy "look at my OC!" story gradually morph into an honestly poignant "look how messed up <em>everyone</em> is without really being anyone's fault!"

            When in doubt,  you can always depend on name generators for unintentional comedy. Apparently,  my name is Comet Pickles,  and am a male unicorn with magenta eyes,  a dark turquoise coat,  has a doughnut  Cutie Mark,  and a wavy midnight blue mane. I am very lucky,  loves exploring,  has a tendency to get lost,  and is very cautious.
