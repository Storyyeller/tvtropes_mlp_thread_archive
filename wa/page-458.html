            Maybe the other pegasi didn't think they were capable or were too stunned to react.  Plus I think they were probably willing to put their faith in the Wonderbolts that jumped in since the Wonderbolts are supposed to be the best of the best.  I don't think anypony was expecting Rarity to accidently clobber them and make the situation worse.

            Yeah,  I'm guessing that everyone figured that they were the best fliers in Equestria and therefore the most qualified.  Any of the other pegasi might have gotten in their way and made it worse.  By the time Rarity KO'd them all,  they were too far away for most non-competitive pegasi to do anything.  Heck,  RD even only barely got to them in time.
<p></p>@Ben10fan: The catch is that the fantasy and reality don't match up.  In reality,  she impressed them at a competition that was specifically designed for flyers to show off their skills.  In her fantasy,  she basically wanted to join them while they were performing.  Say you're trying to impress a famous singer; you're way better off singing for them in a talent competition that they're judging (i.e. Sonic Rainboom's competition),  than you are jumping on stage and trying to do a duet with them at one of their concerts (what RD's fantasy was like).
<p></p>Also,  her fantasy took place <em>before</em> she rescued them; she didn't think they had any reason to notice her outside of her raw skill.

            I would think that the Pegasus pony have an established rescue falling ponies protocol,  and well,  the Wonderbolts would be at the top of the list of people who could do it,  though where the other three of them were is beyond me.
<p></p>Only half the team got knocked out.  Maybe they were trying to follow up,  but then Dash blasted past them.

            Wonder Bolts  are best flyers in Equestria so no point others to go after them,  whoof could know that Rarity was that epic fail damsel that she knock out all 3.
Also many ponies where paralizated with fear and suprice so they can't have cold blood in that situation.

            Well,  if everybody jumped after her,  nothing would get done. And like other people are saying,  the professional flyers were probably the most qualified. As for why nobody followed after them...they couldn't see that far down? They wouldn't have made it in time? They didn't want to add another body to the count,  with Rarity still flailing around like an idiot?
<p></p>It's hard to say exactly what,  but there are plenty of reasons.

<p></p>WHY ISN'T RAINBOW DASH PART OF THE WONDERBOLTS YET?!!! She was BETTER than them! As in,  she was faster than them,  AND she did a Sonic Rainboom,  something that's only ever been done twice,  both times by her!
<p></p>She doesn't NEED to impress them. <strong>They</strong> should be coming to <strong>her</strong> with an offer to join

            They might be full. A team like that probably has a set amount of members. Or maybe show flying has a league,  or something,  that you need to be a part of,  and they just pick you when you're good enough,  Like the globetrotters(I assume)?
<p></p>Actually,  we don't know for sure that she's better than them,  since we've never actually seen them do a show. We've just seen them go after Rarity and get clobbered - Dash was moving so fast that there's no way Rarity could have hit her.
<p></p>As for the sonic rainboom,  firstly,  speed isn't everything. And secondly,  it required her to be going full speed <em>at the ground</em>. How many ponies would even want to attempt that?

            The Wonderbolts are a rather disciplined team,  I'm sure they would let her try out,  and I'm sure she could win,  BUT that doesn't mean the time for it has come up yet.

            I'm guessing that the main thing is that teamwork is a pretty important part of their shows,  and RD hasn't exactly gotten that down yet.
<p></p>Not to mention that she's only ever done the Sonic Rainboom twice,  and one of those was basically due to extenuating circumstances.  She has trouble doing on command,  and outside of that,  we don't really have any points of comparison; we've never seen any other pegasi doing a full performance so we don't know how RD compares.
<p></p>RD definitely has talent,  but she doesn't really have the discipline needed to be part of a team at this point.  She can do some impressive tricks,  but she has trouble performing reliably and is a bit of a loose cannon.
