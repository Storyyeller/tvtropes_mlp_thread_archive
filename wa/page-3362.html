            And I get that,  Ginger. I'm just saying if you're aware of it,  can't you cut her just a little slack? I mean,  you know what she's really like under that,  why is it so hard for you to recognize that she's still there beneath what we see of her?
<p></p>Eh... you know what,  never mind. It's not like it's going to go anywhere,  we're just going around in circles.

            I think Kegi really nailed it. While Pinkie might get development in her own focus episodes,  this really doesn't translate to ensemble or other episodes because unless she is the focus she is a comedic device before she is a character.
<p></p>That is probably why her character development comes across as "token" to Ginger (and to a lesser extent myself).

            I don't think Pinkie is treated as a tool any more than the other characters.  She's just nuts,  so everything she does comes off as humorous (although whether or not you actually enjoy her brand of humor is another story).

<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">But compare how she is when she's the focus to how she is as an ensable character. She rarely has a really significant part as a part of an ensemble,  and her purpose is largely for jokes. Compare to her as a solo character,  where she's much deeper.

I don't want anything from you Ginger...besides not having this arguement everytime Pinkie is mentioned here.
<p></p>We know how you feel about the writer's use of Pinkie...can't we just talk about A Friend In Deed without it reverting back to that?
</div>
<p></p>This pretty much sums up my thoughts on the matter.  We all know how you feel about Pinkie and we'd like to be able to discuss the character without having to defend her to you or listen to your complaints about her.  I love you,  man,  but it really gets aggravating to have to hear your rants about Pinkie every time somebody comments that they like one of her jokes.  It's unfair to people who like her for you to attack her every time she comes up in conversation.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">
but it's a PINKIE episode. How on earth do you expect me to get through this?
</div>
By chilling out and accepting the fact that some people are going to enjoy it,  and the fact that they do doesn't necessarily mean that they're attacking or deliberately trying to bother you.  It's a pretty safe bet that people are going to enjoy Pinkie regardless of what she's like,  and they have the right to enjoy it without being subjected to endless rants about how you dislike the character.  There's nothing wrong with you personally disliking her,  but no matter how much you hate it,  you shouldn't rain on their parade.  They have just as much right to enjoy Pinkie as you have to enjoy Applejack.  Besides,  non-explodely,  non-ranty Ginger is a lot more fun anyway.
<p></p>All I ask is that even if you hate the episode with the fiery passion of a billion suns,  be calm about it and let the people who like the episode enjoy it.
<p></p>And that's all I'm going to say on the matter because I don't want any more drama.

            Fine! My prediction for this episode:
<p></p><ul><li> Pinkie will meet Cranky Doodle. They'll get off on the wrong foot. Cranky will leave in a huff,  and Pinkie will be confused as all hell over why he doesn't want to be friends.
</li><li> Pinkie will then use Shenanagains and over the top gifts to try and befriend him. They won't work.
</li><li> Pinkie discovers that Cranky is sad about something,  and will plan a massive party to try and cheer him up.
</li><li> The plan backfires and Cranky goes on a massive tirade in the middle of the party (in front of all the other guests) about why he doesn't like Pinkie. He then plans to leave Ponyville.
</li><li> Her friends will snap Pinkie out of her rut,  (or she'll do it herself by going off and thinking for a bit) She contemplates WHY she does all these things for people and discovers that she just wants to make them Smile more than anything else
</li><li> She confronts Cranky as he's about to leave and humbly sings the Smile song.
</li><li> Cranky realizes that he was wrong to judge her so harshly and they either become friends,  or agree to put up with each other. (The episode will end with him being more tolerant but still not a big fan of her insane behaviour)
</li></ul><p></p>That's how I'd do it anyway <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">

            @ginger:  To add onto your already awesome prediction:
<p></p><ul><li> As Pinkie narrates her friendship letter,  she invites Cranky Doodle over for one last party,  which turns out to be a nice,  quiet dinner party with just her and either the Mane Six or the cakes.
<p></p></li><li> Pinkie offers to song another song for Doodle.  The Donkey agrees,  and we find its the Piggy Song from the Baby Cakes episode.  Cut to Celestia's bedroom where we hear the donkey yelling out a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo">Big "NO!"</a> that can be heard all the way to Canterlot.

            @Ginger: I'm just hoping that the song isn't what finally does,  and part of me hopes they don't become friends. A dark piece of my soul also hopes that he remains angry at Pinkie by episodes end,  just so the lesson really sinks in.
<p></p>Also i never said it couldn't become a meme,  I just don't think it will.
