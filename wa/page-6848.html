She is obviously quite studious and I'm sure that her current abilities didn't just come to her naturally.  Assuming she is in her late teens early 20's she probably spent at least 10 years in school learning to control her powers,  in all those years she made NO friends,  which leads me to believe she spent every waking moment of her life studying!</span>

            Twi had power but not control in the beginning. In fact,  she still has problems harnessing her power without spell failure (overload cutoff) or losing control. Her control over that force is what she trained hard for.
<p></p>She doesn't have the sheer dedication or stamina AJ has,  or the raw speed and quick reaction Dashie has,  or the utterly fine precision and artistic skill in Illusion Rarity has,  or the intuition and creativity and sheer !happy! that Pinkie has,  or the will of iron under her adorable meekness like Fluttershy.

<p></p>Wow,  that sounded harsh. Rarity is cute. And I think we have a few things in common. And I think she would encourage me to work hard as well.
<p></p>And discussing the pilot again sounds fun. We can do that for every Season 1 episode too. That way,  we can keep the thread active as well &lt;3

<p></p>I think I know what you are saying,  but with Azula it was never a case of natural aptitude so much as her innate perfectionist (remember her introduction with Lightning Bending?),  she practices the same things over and over and over again until she can do it perfectly. Ozai fostered this mentality in her and favored her over Zuko,  so he assumed it was just because she had been naturally better then him,  but that wasn't the case.

            I like Rarity,  but not in a romantic or "she's cute" way. I like her because I very much identify with her struggles in her focus episodes. I know all too well what it's like to be unable to reconcile my morals with my own selfish feelings,  or find myself unable to put as much work into a project as I wanted to because of other things. I like her because she's aware of her flaws,  and does everything in her power to overcome them. I dare you to find another cartoon character with as quick a turnaround as Rarity has in Green Isn't Your Color. She knew from the beginning that she was being unreasonable,  and did what she could to hide that and allow her friend to be happy. I like her because it's abundantly clear that she really wants to be a good person,  and makes a freaking effort to make that a reality.
<p></p>She has her failings,  and falters in that goal,  but so do all of us,  and she understands when she's messed up.
