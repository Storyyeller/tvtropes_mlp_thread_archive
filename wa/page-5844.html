            Yeah hoof mounted makes some sense,  look how hard AJ can buck,  now add in a few feet of steel being added to the end of that (mostly likely from some spring loaded release that keeps the blade riding along her leg until she bucks,  then springing out.
<p></p>Some smaller Katar like blades on the forehooves,  for quick,  but less powerful hits,  maybe some larger weapons held in there mouth,  or head mounted.

            But hoof mounted ones require dang acrobatics in order to utilize and maintain,  if we want something reusable but practical but still comfortable that's a sensible option. I mean they no fingers they still need those hooves to run adaquately.

            You know,  you're all concentrating on slashing weapons here.  Maybe that's the wrong way to go.
<p></p>two-inch-thick horseshoes on the back legs would make one hell of a mace-like weapon.  You could add ridges or short spikes on the bottoms to get good armor-destroying properties as well.

            I thought of another pair of ponies whose cutie marks have nothing to do with their names.  The Flim Flam brothers.  Their names together fit their personalities (smooth-talking con artists) but their cutie marks are both different proportions of an apple.

            You know,  when I considered head mounted weapons lances and mace-heads were also on the table,  even spiked helmets or something.
<p></p>Though I do agree slash weapons are not the best way to go.

<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> given what we've seen AJ do with a lasso,  yeah slings are definitely on the table. But would do much against dragon hide...unless there aiming at the eyes or putting them down his throat.

            Spikes on the hooves would have to be long enough to penetrate so its more like walking on high heels only on your heels. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16"> The ground would have to be soft and sandy to get anywhere without falling over.
<p></p>A morningstar would be practical.  The pony just needs to hold it in its mouth and swing.  With an earth pony's strength it could use a very big spiky ball and long chain.
