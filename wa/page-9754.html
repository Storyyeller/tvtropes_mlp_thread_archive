            That's a story telling issue,  not characterization. Of course that episode <em>did</em> have characterization issues,  but that was with named characters. I do agree that it was the worst episode in the series,  though,  but if we're going to analyze the hell out of the flaws we should at least be correct about what exactly the flaws are.
<p></p>As for the existence of things like cranes and dams,  I don't remember anyone complaining about the existence of Manehattan.

            I don't see how the other Mane 5 were jerkish <em>at all</em>. I know that some think that it was,  but no.
<p></p>Also,  who says that they never had an issue with RD's bragging before. They just decided that it was about time they did something about it as it was getting to the point of <em>actually being dangerous</em>!
<p></p>The town was admittedly odd. I admit that it's the weakest episode of the season,  but the <em>series</em>? No way.
<p></p>EDIT: I agree that Over a Barrel is the <em>real</em> weakest episode of the series. Was Mare Do Well executed poorly? Yes. But it wasn't the disaster that people make it out to be and was actually really entertaining.

            @Sereg When I say worst episode in the series,  do remember that I have stated numerous times that I <em>thoroughly enjoyed watching it.</em> Worst ≠ bad.
<p></p>And where in the world is all of this Over a Barrel hate coming from? That episode makes my top 5. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">

            @Sereg: The issue I have with that assertion is that it wasn't until after they decided to do  the MDW plot that RD was starting to have problems,  and I really see no purpose in the disguise if all they wanted to do was to teach RD a lesson.
<p></p>Also I thought Over A Barrel was ok.

            @ Mio: Well we have ponies being able to pull trains which is never seen again and makes no sense. The battle is fought with pies which are never seen with this capability again. The whole episode pretty much runs on Loony Toons logic which is usually restricted to Pinkie.

            Speaking of weak episodes,  I suppose I should mention that I re-watched Cutie Mark Chronicles again. I don't really hate it anymore,  but I still think that the writing was weak in some parts,  and cheesy too {Moreso then what's usually in this series}. I don't think that it's a horrible episode anymore,  I just think it could have been better.

            @Bad The train pulling is a hang up point for you? I like to think that engine was just damaged or otherwise too weak to get moving without assistance.
<p></p>As for the pies... it's a cartoon. What did you expect them to fight with? Other than those two points,  I fail to see anything remotely resembling "Loony Toons logic."
