<p></p>Even eccentricity,  there's no real 'colo9ur' associated with it,  except perhaps for some strange colour that can only be described with a shade. Like Puce.

            Don't know if there's a specific color for it. Don't know if I'm phrasing this correctly,  but maybe something like the background being in contrast?
<p></p>Wait,  eccentricity...
<p></p>Maybe a contrast like that but try and make it look like a less threatening contrast? (I have no idea why I'm giving advice on this kind of thing when I can't really explain it :P)

            I'm sorry,  I guess I should just explain what it is I'm doing.
<p></p>I've been really worried about Batty lately.  I'm worried that the whole 'dark,  aloft,  different loner type' has just been done to death.  And that some might say that,  apart from being a prime <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartySue" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartySue">Marty Sue</a>,  Batty's just 'boring'.  Plus,  I was worried that the whole bat pony stick was just not worth the trouble.  That 6 ordinary ponies would be a safer bet that going into the rarer aspects of the show that might get undone by canon in the future.
<p></p>Then I realized that in the past,  I had a concept for a crazy 'pigeon' pony called Aviary.  He wore a leather flight helmet with goggles...and talked to birds,  which were his 'troops'.  And I've been thinking...maybe I should remake Batty closer to the 'Aviary' concept instead of the 'dark knight' concept,  only with bats instead.  His flight googles could be tinted to protect his eyes in the day...and maybe,  he's addicted to fruit...so much so that he steals it during the night,  which causes him immense problems of course.  I am hoping that my crew all have 'problems' which prevent them from functioning in society.
<p></p>The clues in the name...he's Areobat...he's <em>Batty</em>...he's crazy!  I feel like I should really jump on that,  what with the naming conventions of ponies and all that.  Of course,  he'd probably need a recolouring...and a major design rethink,  if he's now this mischievous trickster thief type instead of a dark brooding knight.  That's <em>if</em> I even decide to do it.

            @Apple: My advice?  Just don't worry about trying to slot them into a specific role.  Take the characters you have so far,  even if it's only two or three of them,  dump them into a situation,  and write out what they'd say.  It doesn't need to be prose or anything,  just a script of how they'd talk an maybe occasional notes about how they'd gesture.  Let them develop on their own rather than trying to cram them into a mold.

            Remember what someone said about taking a few of your characters,  putting them in a determined situation,  and let the story flow? I'd say you experiment a little with that before discarding or modifying what you have.

            @Story; Neon Lights is one of the lesser known background ponies,  I'm not even sure if he even has a music-related cutie mark but he was wearing shades similar to Vinyl Scratch in one episode ("Sweet & Elite" I think) and some people pegged him as a rival DJ to Vinyl.
<p></p>Of course,  this did not even put a dent in the wave of Vinyl/Octavia works.

<p></p>Yes.  I've never done anything bigger than a short story.  This is way beyond anything I've ever done.  And once you start,  you can't backtrack.

            95% of webcomics are bad in the beginning,  and then get good later. Seriously. The other 5% are started by people who did a different webcomic before that.

            I personally do <em>not</em> have the artistic capacity to even <em>consider</em> a webcomic at all!  I'm just sure with my artwork,  it won't end well,  and my plotwork tends to have a tough time.
<p></p>In any case,  any other topics being discussed for the momentum?

With that in mind,  Apple,  it might be best to start with something smaller than the epic plot you currently have planned. Take your characters and universe and put them in some shorter,  standalone stories. That way,  you'll get experience with characterization,  drawing,  and writing. After a bit of experience,  you should be able to do your big story justice.
