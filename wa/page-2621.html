I understand why it bugs you,  but the show doesn't seem to follow that line of thought.  Then again,  it would hardly be the first time that we flagrantly disregard canon,  so feel free to ignore me.  We'll just say that it doesn't bother me as much as it bothers you and we'll leave it at that.

            Can we either focus on the 'hopes and dreams and magic' explanation <strong>or</strong> the brain chemistry explanation?  Saying that cutie marks exist because of brain makeup is only helping keg reinforce his point,  Ginger.  (Which isn't objectively a bad thing,  but I don't like thinking about brain chemistry as a determinant in <em>humans</em>,  let alone our colorful squishy friends.)
<p></p>^I take that as needlessly sensationalist.

            I'm just going to go with the "cutie marks are magic and therefore always fit the ponies perfectly" theory.

            What I'm saying is: Humans and ponies have different standards. Neither one of us can claim that we're right based on objective fact.
<p></p>If Ponies weren't NATRUALLY like that,  or if they had been magically altered at some point in history to be like that by some higher power with an agenda,  then I could see the concern.
<p></p>We have no implications of that. This is just how ponies work. There's nothing wrong with it. I really hope people can understand what I'm saying <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">

            I'm sorry,  I may have misunderstood something down the line. So just for clarification,  ginger: Are you,  or are you not arguing that the interpretation of a CM is set and immune to change? Because that is the implication I am arguing against.
<p></p>I'm not saying my way is right,  nor that there way is wrong. But if we,  as two races,  interacted,  I would not want to step back and think about the implication that some element of my colourful new friends is not due to their own choice,  but a pre-determined element. Just as they likely would be uncomfortable with the prospect that I'd be completely happy to drift through a 'meaningless' life. They may have an orange morality,  but that doesn't deny me from my blue.
<p></p>Also,  I should apologize for adding to the over-seriousness of the topic. It's the morning,  and I'm a bit too tired to not take things too seriously. Ideal I wouldn't be arguing,  but what the hell,  I'm here already.

            Don't worry about it,  keg.  Your interpretation is as valid as ours.  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">It's not your fault that it's wrong.</a>
<p></p>In all seriousness,  though,  the interpretation can and probably does change.  The mark itself will never change,  but Cheerilee says that she herself didn't know what her own mark was for for a few days after she got it,  and only after a while did she realize that it represented her love of teaching.  So,  the fact that she got her mark represented that she had figured out what it was that she wanted to do,  whether or not she realized it consciously.  Again,  though,  if she decided one day that teaching really wasn't her thing,  she could reinterpret her mark.
<p></p>^Yeah,  there you go.  Well said,  Ginger.

<p></p>Actually,  only half bad. Serious debate isn't that bad,  come to think of it. As long as we don't devolve into bickering. I don't <em>think</em> we devolved into bickering.

            Oh,  I already finished <em>The Colour You Bleed</em>. The final chapter and Epilogue got put on <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EqD" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EqD">Eq D</a> yesterday.
<p></p>Although,  given that it's arc words were "It's not personal",  it might be a good way of linking it to a possible sequel. A heavy theme in Bleed was there was ultimately no control - there was noone pulling the strings,  it wasn't personal - and so it was up to us to give meaning. A sequel could easily expand on that in more depth,  exploring more the idea of a life without ultimate purpose.
<p></p>It even fits well with the plot - It involves a god getting tired of ruling,  and a council trying to initiate a war of conquest. The council believes that it's their purpose and destiny,  and the god believes that there isn't any. Blueblood believes that without purpose you need to make you own.  It's a good point of contrast between three ideals,  which adds another layer to the conflict. No longer just a war between two ponies,  but between two ideals.
<p></p>@Ginger: Alright then,  that's my bad,  and I apologize. You and I are on the same side about this.

<p></p>An article on Cracked.com today mentioned that while <em>War Horse</em> was good,  <em>Horse War</em> would be better.  The article also mentioned that the proposed script for <em>Horse War</em> is just drawings of horses riding in tanks.
