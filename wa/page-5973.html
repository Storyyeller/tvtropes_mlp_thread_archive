            Re: The ending. I don't think it was supposed to be "Pinkie taking the entire cake and leaving <em>nothing for nopony else <strong>ever!</strong></em>" Rather,  I think it was just supposed to be a  characteristic way for her to dig into the sweet after an entire episode of restraining herself. It's simply a visual,  if you will.
<p></p>I mean,  can you imagine her eating a dessert — <em>any</em> dessert — in a <em>reserved</em> manner? Just seems <em>weird</em>,  even thinking about it. There's really no other way for her to go for it than whole-hog,  if you will. It's just her character. I'm sure that the rest got their share,  even the ones who <em>didn't</em> swipe bits of the components during the train ride. After all,  there had to be some form of judging,  and we don't exactly get to see how many slices were taken out of the non-visible side before that piece was cut for Celestia,  now do we? Hell,  they probably did some cutting of the mutilated side and divided it up amongst themselves in order to keep the thing looking even.

            Again: Vivid imagination. Call it cheating,  if you will,  but it's not that hard.
<p></p>Sides,  I get good practice... I live with two roommates who almost never leave the apartment. And it's small,  so all our computers are in the same room. So yeah,  I get like... an evening to myself every week.

            Endearing or not,  it was,  I think,  the only way they could have shown it. To do otherwise would be like... I dunno,  like having Rarity eat something as messily as was shown there. Just completely incongruous,  if you will.
<p></p>Like,  I didn't think <em>anything</em> of it,  when it happened,  to tell you the truth. It's just something she does. It's as natural to the character as Twilight scanning through a bunch of books. Twilight reads,  Rarity sews,  Fluttershy hides,  Dash flies,  Applejack is awesome,  and Pinkie eats.
<p></p>In any case,  only two people on the train were in any sort of position to ask for seconds,  and we don't know how much they had in the cleanup of the evidence of sabatoge.
<p></p>re: 34: I don't like persuing that sort of thing. Not ouf of any moral opposiition to the stuff,  I just have a rule about not seeing sexualizations of characters from works that I'm familiar with. It just makes things... <em>weird</em>. It makes it awkward to watch the show,  and it always seems to turn the characters 1-dimensional.

            Man,  everyone's getting all sorts of nitpicky on this episode. I guess that says something for the general consensus,  then. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>So,  something I noticed when everyone was going over their top 5 episodes earlier was that just about every single one listed was from Season 2,  even for those who have expressed opinions indicating that Season 1 was a bit better in the writing department.
<p></p>I really can't rank episodes that well,  outside of A Dog and Pony Show still being my overall favorite,  but just about every episode does at least one aspect really well that I can really enjoy.

            @ Ginger,  one,  It's Tirac,  or more like Uber-Tirac,  in this he's basicly an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> that was sealed away long ago,  and took out nearly every god and demi-god on the planet except for Luna and Tia's parents. He's close to breaking free,  and manipulates everything from behind the scenes to help him,  damn near almost succeeds,  and in general is just pretty damn compotent about it.
<p></p>plus,  it's got The Doctor. And they ARE written more like a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorWho" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a> episode set in Equestria then a MLP episode with The Doctor in it.
