            Sorry,  I get a shot of inspiration and finished composing my first song. I am fascinated by the prospect of more supernatual creatures. What do you guys think might come up next? A Basilisk might be too frightening and I think we have goblins/trolls in the form of the Diamond dogs.

<p></p>ooh! A Djinn would be fun!

<p></p>So far,  feedback has it her proportions and manestyle make her look a tad like Allie Way. Interesting,  a tall and lean machinist Earth Pony.
<p></p>...And apparently I need to use a better brown. Huh. Time to dig into my colour pool or switch up.

            @Whatshisgame: I hate puns,  but that was so spectacularly horrible that it wraps back around into being awesome.

<p></p>As for the song,  the fandom will find a way. They always do.
<p></p>That said,  I'm not a huge fan of the song; it seemed sort of tacked-on,  like somebody went "dang,  its the christmas episode we need a song guys".

            The only thing that bothered me is that now we have to shoehorn this into our already convoluted fanon. So their flag has Celestia and Luna on it,  but where were they? And Discord,  for that matter? I always got the sense that since the beginning of time,  Discord had ruled,  until the royal sisters overthrew him.
<p></p>Also,  if defeating the Windigos stopped the blizzard in Equestria,  wouldn't they have been able to continue living in their old land and not have to start a mass migration?

If they worked it into a later episode,  it probably would've sounded better.

ages ago you mentioned that you thought the scene from the beginning of this ep felt forced... what did you mean by that exactly?</div>
<p></p>Well,  looking back it really wasn't so much forced as it was unnecessary in the context of what happened in the episode . I understand that they were trying to bookend the play with the Mane Six bickering,  but that is time that could have been spent expanding the play itself,  perhaps getting a proper reconciliation with the three leaders.

            I think the consensus about the flag is that they used a version of the flag that modern equestrian audiences would be familiar with. Call it Artistic Liscense on the part of the ponies who organized the play

            Also bothering me: The CMC. It made sense that they were there (2 had sisters in the play,  and they can't just leave their friend) but the fact that they weren't acknowledged at all. You'd think AJ or Rarity would remind them not to take candy from strangers before letting them loose in Canterlot.

A combo of all 3's previous flags? Maybe something representing the attributes of each race?

<p></p>Discord was probably bopping around somewhere,  then came back one day and was all "what are <em>these</em> new creatures doing here? Ooooh,  they're going to be <em>fun</em> to mess with." After all,  the narration tells us that this happened before Celestia's rule,  which began at the end of Discord's.
