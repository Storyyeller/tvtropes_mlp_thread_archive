            hmmm,  using it like a lance would be problematic,  cuase once they stick the horn/blade in,  they have to work to pull it out before they can move away. BUT would be a VERY good tactic if it's more like an axe blade forming a crest over there heads,  and they slice with that as they fly py,  with a lance part only being used for killing blows,  or last ditch efforts.

            or,  just brainstorming,  if her and Celestia can manipulate the Sun and Moon,  stand to reason they can do some pretty neat tricks with gravity,  could have her cause a massive surge in gravity everytime the dragon tries to lift off,  bringing him crashing back down....

            What if the lances that the pegasi were to use,  if they were to use lances at all,  were designed to break away after striking and piercing the flesh,  Seraphem?  That way,  they wouldn't need to worry about getting them stuck.  I also imagine that the soldiers would also carry smaller auxiliary arms.

            @ Drenius,  yeah that's the only way I can see it working,  plus the added benefit of leaving the weapon inside the dragon,  and if the edges are sharp enough,  doing more damage everytime he moves.

            Guys Guys guys,  I just had this hilarious thought! The Flim Flam brothers should be doing the Team Rocket
Motto (yeah,  take a wild guess who I'm drawing right now).
<p></p>Okay that tangent out of the way; I get the feeling hoof mounted weapons wouldn't exactly be The most practical thing for quadrupedal beings,  I can actually see most of their tools being helmet-mounted or around their necks somehow like the cameras.
<p></p>Thank you Applelight,  I'm glad someone appreciates genius.

            Luna did change her name to Nightmare Moon when she was corrupted,  but I'm not sure that's really the same thing as a pony changing his/her name when getting a cutie mark so that his/her name matches the mark better.  Not to mention Luna changed her name back to her original one when she was healed by the Elements.

            @Sereg: But we aren't talking "became a different person"; she <em>became a separate entity</em>.  We're not talking being born again here,  we're talking <em>she was changed by a malevolent evil into another person entirely</em>.
<p></p>Actually,  the closest example I can think of is Wheatley from Portal 2,  who does keep the same name when he's corrupted by the central core,  so it's not perfect.  Basically,  the issue I'm taking with it is the implication that Luna consciously decided to call herself Nightmare Moon - which very well may be the case,  but she was mentally corrupted,  so I'm not sure how much of 'her' was still left at that point.
