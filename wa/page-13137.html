            Sometimes but he does bring good points.
<p></p>And at least the Luna thing is a minor thing,  the flame wars on some sites over Spike at your service were ridiculous. BTW,  my opinion is that Spike was perfectly in character the whole episode. Two minutes on his introduction he trips and falls from a stair and re-watching season 1 he is always tripping or dropping things so Spike is always clumsy as far as IÂ´m concerned.

            Oh,  are we on about the whole,  'Spike's Dragon Code of Honour' thing? A while ago I compiled a list of everything that was brought up with no prior warning in any given episode. just for reference. Here it is:
<p></p>FUCKING EVERYTHING
<p></p>Of course,  if I had to narrow it down to things that relate solely to something a character can do/has/any given character element,  it'd probably go something like,  in chronological order, 
<p></p>Twilight Being Celestia's Student
<p></p>Twilight being able to Teleport
<p></p>the elements of Harmony
<p></p>Luna's... everything
<p></p>Applejack has a little sister(Also for bonus,  Rarity has al ittle sis,  Pinkie has two siblings,  Twilight has a big brother,  etc.)
<p></p>Pinkie's Pinkie sense, 
<p></p>Do you see where I'm going with this?
<p></p>A character element being introduced for the first time is NOT an ass-pull,  <em>especially</em> if it returns.

Generally speaking he reviews stuff that he likes,  or at least stuff he finds interesting.

            @Applelight - I wholeheartedly agree. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin">
<p></p>I was rather indifferent about Luna's presence. It felt unnecessary to me; feel as if Scootaloo could have reached the epiphany herself.
<p></p>Also,  how did RD know Scoot was falling down the stream? She certainly didn't mention Luna letting her know through dream or whatnot.

He use to be a really good reviewer,  even giving Mlp Fim a positive review on his show about a year ago,  but ever since the season two finale came out,  he's just getting really nitpicky about the show {Seriously,  he threw a fanboy rage over A Canterlot Wedding}. He pretty much hates every single thing about season 3 so far.
<p></p>And when Megan Mcarthy mentioned on her twitter that the ending of Wonderbolts Academy was going to have a diffrent scene,  CR left a rude comment saying "Where Twilight wakes up and discovers that the last 10 episodes were just a dream?"

            She woke up,  saw Scoots wasn't around,  and went looking.
<p></p>And as said above,  something new =/= asspull. EVERYTHING was new at some point. Though i do admit he did seem a bit over-clutzy in that one. Though could just be from being over eager.
<p></p>Oh and if it's something that a large amount of people already theorized she could do,  it is far from and asspull if it's THAT obvious a fit.

            Exactly d roy,  I think that you could write her off the episode and it would still work perfectly. She feels kind of forced to me.
<p></p>And hereÂ´s something funny. When I first started wacthing the show and I reached Stare Master my honest reaction was "WHAT? They are sisters? What the hell? Just because they are both white unicorns? In what moment did they established they were sisters? At least Apple Bloom was there at the start of the episode,  what the hell? This is stupid? It makes no sens- oh look at Sweetie she is so cute!"
<p></p>Really I never liked that Sweetie and Rarity were turn into siblings out of the blue. I wonder if anybody complained back then (I joined in season 2 so I wouldnÂ´t know)

            Well,  when I first started out with the show,  I allready had the knowledge that they were sisters {I was told that Rarity had a younger sister named Sweetie Belle},  so it really didn't affect me very much.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            I'm fine with them introducing new stuff as long as it doesn't contradict established plot points or characterization.  As far as Luna goes,  I don't see how it does.  If anything it gave NMM more credibility with the implication that her title was literal.  I can't think of any canonical info we have about Luna that contradicts her having Dreamwalker powers.
<p></p>Or if it's an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a>,  but even in this case,  I think it's a logical extension of Luna's abilities,  and the fact that it isn't foreshadowed much is mitigated by the fact that Scoots didn't need much of a push to take care of things.

            I'm not even sure that counts as being "out of the blue",  given that Sweetie didn't do much after Call of the Cutie (which was a short gap between that episode and Stare Master).

            @Seraphem: I wouldn't go so far as to say you should <em>continually</em> introduce new things. That's a really good way to drown the story in unnecessary elements.  The best route is moderation,  introduce a new thing here or there to keep things fresh without overdoing it.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I don't see how not introducing new characters are settings would make the show crappy.
<p></p>As for Rarity and Sweetie Belle,  Sweetie only showed up in one episode (Call of the Cutie) before being identified as Rarity's sister,  and there wasn't any logical point in COTC to bring up that information,  given that Sweetie doesn't even show up until the very end.  She's introduced at the end of one episode,  and the next episode that she plays a part in identifies her as Rarity's sister. That's pretty damn efficient.
