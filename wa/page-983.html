            The marks do relate to their talents,  just through the events that revealed them.  Remember that Rarity only got her mark once she designed the costumes for the play (full of gems),  so hers isn't even as tangential as Fluttershy's.

She performed the sonic rainboom true,  but at no point were either clouds or Rainbow tinted lightning involved. I'm sure there's something inside the cloud as well

            ^^The marks don't have all that much to do with the so-called epiphany event.  Rarity's cutie mark refers to her designing,  not to her finding the Rock.  I imagine Fluttershy's has to do with her whole 'So Many Wonders' scene,  including comforting the animals,  since it's all interacting with animals in ways that other ponies wouldn't have been able to.  The cutie marks are supposed to be referential,  not the exact thing that caused them to appear.

            Oh yeah,  Justanotherbrony,  here was the page about the new Minty toy: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/g4-minty-on-taobao.html">http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/g4-minty-on-taobao.html<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<p></p>I like how in the comments,  someone linked my silly video about Minty being Pinkie Pie's "waifu".  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">  I also like some of the comments that tried to explain her personality a bit:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Minty is best G3 pony,  of course though,  that's not exactly saying much. Back then,  she was basically a less-competent version of today's Pinkie Pie. But,  she had an obsession with socks. I personally wouldn't mind seeing her as a character in Season 2. </div>
<p></p>See,  that right there could be interesting if the cartoon's writers decide to make G4 Minty anything like her G3 self: Someone who <em>wants</em> to be as funny and spontaneous as Pinkie Pie,  but can't quite pull it off.

So a super fast rainbow emerging from a cloud.

            Still trying to think of how Cheerilee got her mark.
<p></p>How would she have figured out that teaching was her special talent? Did her teacher leave her in charge of the class for a few minutes or something when she was a filly.

Just because most of the cast gets their marks by doing something exciting doesn't mean a pony can't get their mark for something more passive.

            Well,  my point was that they all got their marks by doing something.  That doesn't mean another pony couldn't get their mark by simply having a quiet moment of realization.  Cheerilee could be sitting in class,  listening to her teacher,  and just suddenly realizes that she wants to teach as well.

            I still think there has to be some other factor that controls how the cutie mmark manifests itself,  or at least controls what shape it takes.
<p></p>If cheerilee was just sitting down one day and realized: "Holy Shit,  I wanna be a teacher" it would be a bit strange if she suddenly looked down and saw smiling flowers on her ass

Although to be honest,  that explanation sounds like something she spent days coming up with after the fact.  I doubt she knew exactly what it meant when she got it.
<p></p>"Yes!  That's it!  I'm going to be a teacher when I grow up!  And what's this?  Is that my cutie - huh? Flowers?  The hell does that mean?"

            ^^But that's not what happened,  so it's a moot point.  =D
<p></p>I guess it really is as personalized as the pony's calling is.  It might also depend on their interpretation of their calling - for instance,  Rarity's calling is design,  and she interprets that as making everything beautiful with her beloved gems.  Heck if I know.

Speaking of Cheerilee,  does anyone else hope she gets a lot more screentime this season?  She's one of my favorite non-mane cast ponies,  and I really like that she seems to have a bit of a friendship with Twilight.

            Actually they could do an episode with that.  Twi starts hanging out with Cheerilee a lot,  then starts worrying that she's neglecting her other friends.
