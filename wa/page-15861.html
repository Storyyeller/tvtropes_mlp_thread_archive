            I think AJ is 20 because she gives off a vibe of being responsible and experienced,  but still young enough that she thinks she knows it all and is stuborn,  the way we act wen first getting into college. Twi's a product of her upbringing so she's not quite as mature as she'd like to be,  but is grounded in her work. Pinkie's a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">mare filly</a> in that she's at an older age but her personality negates much maturity. Rainbow seems to be in her late teens given her general response to her problems and the way she approaches life from a wreckless perspective. I take the young flyer's competition to be an equivalent for freshmare-level college try-outs.

            Twi is kind of a "working on my doctorate thesis" student,  really. Which really doesn't suggest her being the youngest of them all. If anything,  it might paint her as one of the <em>older</em> ones.

            As for the Snooty Snark Evaders,  I'd place them around 10 and a half to eleven at the start of the series with a year each season. Applebloom  is the oldest by a few months,  Sweetie is in the middle,  and Scoots is 6 months younger than Sweetie,  making her 8 months younger than AB.

<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">1-2 years older for me,  but if THAT'S how the writers want to make it,  then so be it. I mean,  you'd think mabey Pinkie and AJ are the same age since both of them never went to school(I'm guessing) and are mature enough to be working on their respected farms.

            Are we talking ages again? My take from oldest to youngest is:
<p></p><ul><li> Fluttershy (visibly taller than all the others in the <em>Cutie Mark Chronicles</em> flashbacks,  canonically a year older than Pinkie who is closer in size to the others,  behaves maturely aside from crippling shyness which knows no age restriction)
</li><li> Rarity (the most superficial trappings of maturity,  successfully runs and manages her own independent business)
</li><li> AJ (behaves maturely,  almost motherly toward Applebloom,  seems to be in charge of operation of Sweet Apple Acres despite Big Mac clearly being older)
</li><li> Pinkie (confirmed to be a year younger than Fluttershy,  behaves immaturely,  but believe this to be in spite of age rather than because of due to apparent competence and responsibility regarding her job)
</li><li> Twilight (student status,  naivety,  and proneness to panicking indicate inexperience with the non-academic world and inter-pony relationships suggesting youth)
</li><li> Rainbow (behaves immaturely in all aspects of her life,  high pitched voice,  appears to be slightly smaller than the others in the CMC flashback,  though that may just be because she's only seen with Fluttershy and some colts in the flashback)
</li></ul><p></p>I'd place them all within two years difference,  tops,  between Fluttershy and Rainbow,  all being in whatever the pony equivalent of their early 20's is.

            It's been three years too,  so the girls have surely moved on in years too.
<p></p>I don't tend to get involved in mane six pony age discussions though because I feel that we don't have enough information.
