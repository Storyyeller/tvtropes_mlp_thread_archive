            I personally like G1 MLP (and G3 as well),  and the songs are one of the things I like from it.  Probably my favorite song from G1 MLP is "There's Nothing Quite Like Shadows" which is a villain song from "Bright Lights."
<p></p>Then again,  I also probably have an abnormally high tolerance and liking for things that normal people seem to think are cutesy or "cheesy, " so that probably has something to do with it as well.  I honestly don't really understand the concept of something being "cheesy" or "corny" in the metaphorical sense (as in,  not in the sense of the foods cheese and corn),  when I read that someone considered a story or a scene to be "cheesy, " I'm usually not quite sure what the problem is.  I probably wouldn't really be able to notice it if someone was acting "dorky, " either.

            Mermares AND seaponies?  I wonder how the two are different.  Is it that one group is more like seahorses and the other is like ponies with fish tails?
<p></p>Edit: Okay,  I looked up the definitions of the metaphorical "corny" and "cheesy" and now I'm even more confused because they seem like they're describing opposite things.  "Corny" was defined as being "banal" or "overly sentimental" which isn't quite the same as "cheesy, " which I saw being defined as being more "inauthentic" or "fakey."  I don't really think that the G1 MLP stories are "fakey" (no more than any other story about characters who aren't real),  but I could see how some people could find it to be too sentimental or childish if they prefer more cynical works.

            @storyyeller: No,  but they do have long-term imprisonment sentences,  like with Nightmare Moon and Discord.  Considering that Celestia (and probably their society in general) is big on giving second chances,  even to someone like Discord,  I don't think they would want to permanently end someone's life like that unless they were somehow absolutely certain that the being in question could NEVER be convinced to reform of his/her/its own free will.  Although the fates of Chrysalis and especially Sombra make for a bit of a potential gray area,  depending on whether or not Sombra really was killed.  (Sorry,  but I can't answer your other question because I don't know what Debian even is.)

            Introducing new fans is good. Just remember,  if they truly decide they don't care for the show,  we have to accept it. It does happen.
<p></p>Oh,  and choosing an episode is a gamble,  I guess. Just pick an installment that can be enjoyed on its own and you feel can stand as a good example of the show.

            Time because it can be considered less girly to a newcomer,  Chronicles because although it's a pretty cute episode there's quite a bit of humour and lampshade hanging,  Harmony for establishing the characters and showing them that the show can be dark,  and the pilot for obvious reasons.

            Come to think of it,  we haven't even seen a court system of any kind in Equestria,  nor do they seem to have police officers.  Then again,  most of the ponies may simply be better behaved than real-life humans and thus they might not need that kind of thing as much.
