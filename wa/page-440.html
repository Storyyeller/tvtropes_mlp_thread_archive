            I love this show and every character in it(except Gilda,  Trixie and Blueblood of course) but some people claim the Cutie Mark Crusaders are a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight Stealing Squad</a>. actually they are not,  "Call of the Cutie" was about Apple Bloom specifically,  the Spotlight was shared with Fluttershy in "Stare Master" and they where just a framing device in "the Cutie Mark Chronicles". and about the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Aesop Amnesia</a>,  here's how I see it,  Scootaloo idolizes Rainbow Dash and Rainbow doesn't really seem to get the whole "finding out who you are" thing in her own cutie mark story. so Scootaloo isn't going to get it either and as the de facto leader of the Crusaders,  Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle probably aren't going to get that until Scoots does.

            @Fallen Legend: Which C.S. Lewis quote are you talking about?
<p></p>Anyway,  I don't think that it's that Gilda and Trixie have never been "taken down a peg" so much as they've never been in a position where their jerkish-ness causes trouble for them.  For whatever reason,  they've somehow either never been in a position where people disliked them as a result of their bitchiness,  or they simply never noticed.

<p></p>I guess the thing is I don't understand in what capacity any of that clears Gilda.  The fact is,  she's apparently never had any real redeeming qualities ("caring about Dash" doesn't count,  especially given that she abandoned her in the end anyway).  If it's because she chose to hang with the wrong crowd,  well,  that's still her discretion at work there.

            I just realised why I'm so adamant about finding the good in everyone on this show. It's because outside of beings who are pure evil,  the tone of the show just DRIPS with <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">Defeat Means Friendship</a>,  and I find it cooler to look at every character as if they were a potential new cast member. So it's better to picture them as inherantly good people who have been misguided in some way,  and need friendship to show them true hapiness

            I really can't bring myself to really "like" Gilda. She was intended to be an unlikable character,  with virtually no redeeming qualities. A subversion of the annoying "Bad-guy-learns-their-lesson-and-gets-along-with-the-good-guys" trope (whatever the name for that is). I have no problem with people making <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretations" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretations">Alternate Character Interpretations</a> of her (in fact,  they can be very interesting at times),  but I draw the line at trying to say that it's canon

<p></p>"Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval,  instead of as a merely descriptive term,  cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up,  to admire the grown up because it is grown up,  to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are,  in moderation,  healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten,  I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things,  including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up." -C.S. Lewis

            @Turnways Flip: Have you seen my WMG that gryphons are pretty rare in Equestria,  and thus Gilda had basically no friends until she met Dash (due to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Zecora syndrome</a>)?  It goes a long way toward explaining her possessiveness,  though not,  I must admit,  her willingness to leave Dash.  Of course,  the pride to never back down even when you know you're in the wrong,  and the sense of betrayal when one's only friend sides with The Masses who have historically been dismissive of you,  even when the individuals themselves have done nothing to you and you have in fact been cruel to them... those are powerful forces.
<p></p>That really is a great quote.

            Sigh,  I hope Gilda enjoys the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">leather pants</a> I keep giving her. Maybe it's because I like villains more than heroes,  maybe it's because I don't want to see a relationship end badly,  but there's just something about her,  something... kind. I say Gilda's at least the character with the greatest shot at redemption,  since I'm sure she was ABOUT to consider being sorry for what happened in episode 5,  if it wasn't for the fact that she was confronted in front of so many people and she got embaressed

            I still agree with Tunways,  Gilda and Trixie are young adults and thus it's their own fault they're jerks. DT and Silver Spoon get a pass because they are children.
