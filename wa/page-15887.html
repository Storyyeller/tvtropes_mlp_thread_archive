So seeya guys tomorrow.

            Yeah,  that one.
<p></p>Personally I consider the new series to be a step down in terms of execution,  but more than that I can't stand some of the new fans spouting memes and gush over Ten while happily ignoring everything that came before.

            Its not lie the old series was perfect.. it did have Colin baker,  and a whole lot of camp. Yeah there were also a lot of great bits but,  tons of bad as well. Plus,  this is the BBC,  they really REALLY hate letting people watch their stuff without paying them money,  so kind of hard for most people to even see the older stuff.

            No,  no permaban. I'm currently trying to <em>politely</em> explain to him why this is inappropriate and he was punished for it.
<p></p>It isn't the first time this guy's been punished,  and apparently he's taking it personally. I'm trying very hard not to let this become personal... but if he pushes this too far he is getting a smackdown.

            Well keg,  the guy sounds like an ass.  However,  I do applaud you for taking the responsible path and try to engage in civil discourse withe the punk.  Permabanning him right off while potentially cathartic would not be civil.
<p></p>Well tomorrow's the day.  I'm getting the first lens implanted in my left eye.  I have to admit I'm a bit nervous about having an instrument inside my eye during the procedure,  but it's a little late to stop now.  I'm sure it'll be fine,  in any case.
<p></p>Also please excuse any typos and the timing of my responses as I've been typing on new smart phone and I'm still getting the hang of it.

            So I don't know if its been talked about yet,  but saw <a class="urllink" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0762454156">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> brought up on Equestria Daily. An illustrated book with Firefly.
<p></p>I don't really want to jump the gun here as it could be just some kind of G1 re-release thing like with the <em>Minty Christmas</em> movie,  but what are the chances Hasbro is legit bringing back Firefly? Amazon currently lists that illustrated book thing as coming out on April 22,  and April 14th is the 30th Anniversary of <em>Rescue at Midnight Castle</em>...
<p></p>Fine,  I'm grasping at straws here.

            @Keg: Honestly,  I respect you for making an attempt to explain it to him rather than just booting him.  Sure,  he might just be an asshat,  but he also might just be ignorant,  and in that case the best course of action is to make them not ignorant.  If he keeps it,  yeah,  ban his ass,  but it's good that you're trying to explain why that's in such bad taste.
<p></p>@Ike: Keg isn't a mod here.  Meta Four,  however,  is.  So behave. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">  Also,  we <em>have</em> had issues in the past,  although we haven't had any real problems in a long time. I can't even remember the last time someone was even thumped.

            @ JT: Back when Ginger was still here I'd hazard to guess.  I'm probably mistaken though.  I'm not often here except for the evenings after all.
