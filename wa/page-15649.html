            There's also Philossbelle now,  too.
<p></p>Not to try and fan the fire if the conversation has passed,  but for my two cents about Social Justice Bloggers: While I kind of agree with their intent,  I disagree with their methods. Nothing bothers me more than someone who whines about how terrible something is,  but does <em>nothing</em> to stop it. I admire the SJB's desire to enact change,  at the very least.
<p></p>That said,  you don't HAVE to be a dick about it. I actually follow a LGBTQ humour blog,  and the mod is kinda slowly morphing into a SBJ,  largely by being an enormous dick to people who dare to imply s/he might dislike straight people or allies. While I agree with his/her point that a lot of allies don't actually have our best interests at heart and/or feel entitled to cookies for basically being good people,  and there's certainly valid reason to dislike one's oppressors,  it's important to recognize the allies who <em>are</em> genuinely trying to help and equally to recognize that,  while 'heterophobia' is never going to become entrenched and institutionalized,  blanketly hating all straight people for the sins of some is the shit isms are made of.
<p></p>In general,  assuming that everyone on the opposite side of whatever issue you have - gay marriage,  abortion,  rape culture(Not rapists themselves,  mind,  but unsuspecting people who have simply been raised into an admittedly fucked up culture) are willfully ignorant,  stupid or even evil,  is a great way to <em>never get anything done</em>. Being abrasive is going to get your [debate]opponent to dismiss your argument out of turn where they <em>might</em> be convinced,  and moreover it's going to make an undecided observer,  who are ultimately the <em>most</em> important people in a debate,  to associate your side of the argument with a huge dick,  and so they're far more likely to go to the other side.

            Well on the idiocy of the review section,  I see a lot of dumbest and worst crap is coming from that x86 guy that keeps popping in here to scream about how horrible bronies are and how if you like MLP then you must like Barney and so are a horrible POS,  just because the network where he lives showed the two of them back to back a times. and yet he keeps watching episodes.
<p></p>Yeah,  just a really dumb troll,  just ignore them and they go away.

            He shows up infrequently enough that I find him vaguely amusing,  actually.
<p></p>I always thought,  though,  his major criticism were less against the show and more against Treehouse - the network he watches it on,  which for the record is a channel for <em>toddlers</em>,  it's other major programming being Caillou,  Barney,  etc.,  which makes the choice to show ponies there confusing,  but eh...
<p></p>No seriously though,  why not YTV? Why not Teletoon? I'll admit that's a baffling damn station choice.

            I imagine Barney translated into the FIM universe would come off as a well-meaning,  but generally kinda creepy guy... like,  kinda like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Megamind" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Megamind">Hal</a> before the murder bits came out.
<p></p>Barney: Come on,  miss grouchy grumps! You need a hug!
<p></p>Twilight: I <em>need</em> personal space!
<p></p>...yup,  got it. Plot idea: During experimentation with the magic mirror,  Twilight finds out a way to open up another portal,  and pulls through Barney. Because the portal was kind of a weird magic(Needs to be tied to an object and a tirgger,  which it had exactly neither of),  she set about trying to find out if the transfer had any anomalous effects on him,  and see if she can trace his home dimension.
<p></p>Unfortunately,  all she discovers is that he's really,  <em>really</em> annoying. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It ends with a bittersweet <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangerInAFamiliarLand" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangerInAFamiliarLand">Stranger in a Familiar Land</a> ending as when Barney finally does get the chance to go back he realizes he no longer fits in with his far-too-wholesome home dimension.</span>

            The ultimate evil. One who seems to be espousing the same values as the ponies should,  yet in such a horrible over done way it makes ponies physically ill and give them diabetes. All part of his plan to weaken them for the coming of his master,  Tirek.
<p></p>What,  I just freaking want Tirek to show up in FIM.

            The x89 guy reminds me of a guy,  who left a MLP forum I visit. He complained quite much about the users. I wouldn't say that he doesn't have a point,  but considering that he began and ended his posts with insults and generally seemed very immature,  I have a lot of trouble taking him seriously. That he claimed that about 95% of the users are retarded and yet stayed for over eight months,  doesn't help.
<p></p>Anyway,  since a while,  there is something that bothers me about "Art of the Dress". More precisely,  the line "Hook and eye,  <em>couldn't you just simply die</em>?" I mean,  what the hell is up with that? It comes out of the blue,  with no apparent reason. It sounds like Rarity wants RD to drop dead,  but I find that rather... unlikely. I could understand it,  if she says that because she is stressed out,  due to the revisions she has to make (and causing the dresses to look awful),  but since that line comes long before that happens,  that wouldn't make any sense.
