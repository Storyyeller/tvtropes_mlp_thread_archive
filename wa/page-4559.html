            Applelight,  I actually liked 'Shy's show of strength at the end of the episode.  I loved how her saying "no" to Iron Will floored both Rarity and Pinkie.

            It was petty dickery but that was ALL it was. He wasn't being malevolent. He wasn't being sadistic. He was being spoiled. A problem which ceased as soon as Shy stood up to him.
<p></p>his dickish attitude has most Definitely helped her out in the past (he seems to act as her assertiveness most of the time)
<p></p>For all we know,  throughout this whole ep he was TRYING to make her be assertive

            It's either that or admit that Angel has multiple personality disorder. because you can't deny that he HAS helped her in both previous eps AND this one for no apparent personal gain.

<p></p>^Not necessarily.  A constant personality doesn't mean unchanging interactions with someone.

            Well,  I like to think I have a fairly consistent personality,  and I don't always act the same way with people.  What we call characterization inconsistencies can be attributed,  Watsonian...ally,  to changes in mood and things like that.  God knows I've never reacted like this to an episode before,  and I'm more than 80% certain it's because I've been so stressed recently.
<p></p>Also... "Cut in line,  <strike> I'll take what's mine</strike>I'll cut you" works better,  Fluttershy.

            People don't behave the exact same way all the time.  I can be really nice to my sister one moment and kind of a dick later,  it doesn't mean I have multiple personalities.  The problem is that Angel is a dick an awful lot,  and the times he's helped her aren't really significant enough to balance that out.  Being selfless occasionally doesn't excuse slapping someone because you don't like their food.
