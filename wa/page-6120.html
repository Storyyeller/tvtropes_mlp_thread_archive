            Part of the reason I don't post as much is probably because I don't like to just post for the sake of saying something,  and I usually post here only if I have something pony-related to mention.  I also usually try to read all the posts each time I look at this thread rather than jumping to the last page,  which also takes up time.
<p></p>@Ginger: I'm kind of confused.  Did you say that you dislike Twilight for being overpowered now?  Because I thought you said before that she was your second-favorite of the Mane Cast after Applejack?  Or did you change your mind? (And no,  I don't see anything wrong with you disliking Twilight if that's the case,  people are entitled to their own opinions.)
<p></p>@Ponymanga Daioh: I love that!  I always thought that Rainbow Dash reminded me of Tomo,  at least personality-wise.  Mainly because of her impish troublemaker moments,  such as her behavior in Luna Eclipsed.  However,  Rainbow Dash is probably nicer in general than Tomo.
<p></p>@The fanon debate: I don't necessarily follow the fanon interpretations of characters myself,  especially the background ponies.  For example,  and I know that this will probably upset some fans whenever my "next-gen ponies" story comes out,  I don't necessarily assume that Dinky is related to Derpy.  I considered making her being a child Derpy had before she married Pinkie,  but then I decided that I didn't really need to follow fanon like that and thought that I'd just rather use the kids I made up rather than worrying about fanon.  I certainly don't mind the stories and artwork about Derpy and Dinky being a mother/daughter pair and agree that it's very cute,  but I didn't really want to do that in my own story,  especially since it's not something made clear in the show itself,  it's just something the fans made up.

            @Ginger: If Twilight is your second favorite,  and you outright dislike her for being overpowered,  then does that mean you hate everyone else in the Mane Cast besides just Pinkie?  Or do you mean that you specifically dislike Twilight's overpowered side but like everything else about her? (I think I may have taken you too literally there.)
<p></p>By the way,  I think that Applejack's "what you see is what you get" nature is probably the main thing that makes her so appealing to me.  I like that she's honest about herself and doesn't usually pretend to be something she's not.
