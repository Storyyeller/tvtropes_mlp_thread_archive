            I've always assumed Cadence and Shining Armour do the best they can to get the crystal ponies back to normal,  there's no way you can just cure 1000 years of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> and depression. Still,  I'm pretty sure they're doing a very good job at ruling fairly and cheering up the ponies. Though I'd imagine Shining at least has semiregular visits to Celestia to serve in the guard.

            He's probably not captain anymore,  but at the least must have reports and advice to give to the pony soldiers. And yes,  they must exist. I'd imagine there isn't as much war as on Earth,  but they must at least have skirmishes with the other races now and again. Besides,  Shining and Celestia demonstrate stern discipline in times of crisis,  so that kind of training must come from somewhere,  if only by implication. Since Equestria is implied to be a pretty decent-sized country,  there must be many races wanting such well-maintained and fertile lands.

            Hell,  the ponies themselves are worth invading for. With the strength of Earth Ponies,  they'd make excellent slave labor. The Pegasai would make great use in warfare,  and just imagine the destruction if Unicorns could be trained for battle. their levitation powers alone could do a lot of damage if working together,  enough of them could hurl large boulders,  disrupt  sensative cargo and supply wagons,  and that's not even getting into those with powerful magic like Trixie  or Twilight Sparkle.

            True,  but if they can be isolated,  and brainwashed into thinking no one needs them aside from those that have captured them,  they'd probably break rather easily. Earth Ponies strike me as very dependant on others for inner strength. Pinkie will go nuts if she doesn't have anyone to be happy or make friends with,  and similarly Applejack can put up with a number of demands,  but doesn't seem to know what to do if no one needs her. Given that,  if Earth Ponies can be twisted into depending on their slavers,  that will create an unbreakable loyalty they would find very hard indeed to reject.

<p></p>In the next fanfic of my fanverse,  you find out about this! Long story short,  zebras with a special talent related to anything magical or of a similar nature are expected to go on a sbbatical outside of zebrica to expand their studies before returning to bring new knowledge to empower the zebra kingdom. Zecora was  concerned about recent behaviour of the King Zebra (yes,  this is very loosely based on the parody German comic) moved to the other side of the world for her sabbatical and never returned.
