            Yeah,  Hasbro's a toy company first. Mattel is their eternal rival. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MonsterHigh" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MonsterHigh">Monster High</a> is probably going to be the main competition (which launched in 2010,  same year as MLP G4,  funny enough).
<p></p>I just keeping thinking back to the investor meeting and all this talk "new ways to experience and play with My Little Pony" and "consumer insight". Did Consumer Insight tell them that young teen girls don't want ponies?
<p></p>For those who don't know,  this is Monster High.

<p></p>Quite possibly. You don't see a whole lot of "equestrian" stuff marketed to any girl older then 10. That is traditionally seen as a phase that they get past along with all their other hobbies so they can focus on important stuff.

            Yeah,  a big part of it is probably that the current MLP line is seen as being too kiddy.  Even the brony phenomenon might not have helped with that given that most of them are <em>men</em>.  It's entirely possible that actual ponies don't go over well with girls that are older than the target demographic.

            And you have decided to share this here why? Beyond rather pathetic trolling? Since,  no one in this thread gives a buck,  or even gets all that pissed over this,  and pretty much just stays civil,  or "wait and see"
<p></p>Also,  THIS is the shit that really pisses me off. Anytime some group gets upset with anything it's always "Calm down bronies" Bronies are freaking out" "The fandom is burning" when it's ALWAYS just a small,  if noisy minority. And the majority of the "drama" is being generated by the people bitching about the people who are upset.
<p></p>Given that no one in this thread is acting in a way that requires that message,  the simple fact you decided you just HAD to come here and share it is rather insulting. If people would just shut up about the drama,  there would only be like 1/10th of the actual drama happening.
<p></p>And also,  stop fucking taking the views of a minority as some statement by the whole.

            I thought of a reason why the human dolls would be made with the same body type.  It's because that makes it possible for the dolls' clothing to fit any of the dolls,  otherwise you'd have some dolls where the clothing would be too big or too small for them.  Yes,  that would be more realistic,  but I know I always liked switching the outfits on my dolls and having them wear outfits that would normally go with other characters sometimes (like switching the Senshi outfits on my <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorMoon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a> dolls).

            Yup,  troll.
<p></p>And guess what,  don't give a fuck about Hasbro,  and no,  we do not "revolve around Hasbro" neither would I expect them to do the reverse. barring when they inject themselves into the fandom,  I,  and most I'd say,  really don't give a flying fuck about the company.
<p></p>it's the writers,  animators,  VA's,  and other DHX people that make the show great. Hasbro is just being what it is. A corporation.
<p></p>Now,  if all you want to do is troll,  try somewhere else.

Is just rather pathetic.

            Hi I have questions about this spin off of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic called Equestria Girls. I do not know if this is real or a hoax.
1.Will this show be suitable for younger children so they can watch this along with Friendship is Magic? This new show is advertise on Kidscreen Magazine and it seem to about kids show.
2.Will this show air on the Hub along with Friendship is Magic?
3.If this is shown on the the Hub will it air on saturday morning before or after Friendship is Magic?
4.Will this show be rated TV Y like Friendship is Magic or rated TV Y7 or TV G?

            @Seraphem: Chill out,  you're just proving his point.  You aren't helping the case by acting exactly like he claims the fanbase is acting. Either respond calmly or just ignore him.
<p></p>@Truteal: We pretty much all know that; I've been saying that ever since it was announced. Don't assume that just because a few members of the fanbase got their jimmies rustled doesn't mean that everybody did.  Heck,  most of the drama I've seen is between the handful of people who got butthurt,  and the people who got butthurt about them.  The other 80% or so of the fandom just don't care.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">We really don't know any of that yet.  The only info we have is that there's going to be a spinoff show that likely involves the cast as human teenagers. Past that we got nothing.
