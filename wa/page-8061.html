            Well,  yeah,  it obviously depends on the fic.  Although I do wish more people focused on the idiosyncrasies of Pinkie's personality rather than making all of her scenes metafictional.

<p></p>The best parts of CEQ!Pinkie is when she's being a relatively low-key,  understanding,  bubbly,  sensitive kind hearted good pony. It's so much more compelling than her being out of her mind and talking about the fic's readers

            I agree with Perpetual Lurker and JT on Pinkie.
<p></p>What makes it tolerable in CRISIS (though admittedly not great) is that the Mane 6 are meant to have become more powerful,  so they can all do things that they haven't managed in canon.
<p></p>@Ginger: The reason you thinki that Starlight's getting weaker is because she was tired in that fight. It's made clear because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she was maving the <em>entire landscape</em>!

            I <em>like</em> metafiction (in college I wrote a story that consisted of the author talking to a character),  but yeah,  there's a pretty big glut of "ponies are aware of the audience" stories out there.  They <em>can</em> be good,  but a lot of the time they're really similar,  so they have to be spectacularly well written to stand out.  Lots of people try to coast by on the novelty of "lol Pinkie knows she's in a fanfic" when so many people have written that already that the novelty value is lost.

            Pinkie's power in CRISIS is named after versimilitude. Gilderoy admitted that it was difficult to explain,  but it's basically the ability to alter the nature of the world (excluding the breaking of fundamental borders). Each user has their own limitations that they can't break. In Pinkie's case,  she can't use her powers in a way that isn't funny or which has been denied as impossible by a witness. That second part is actually a huge weakness as she can be told "You can't do X." and then she can't ever use her powers to do X again.

<p></p>Pinkie is pretty much the worst choice of opponent for Red. She'd be more effective against anypony else. I'd really like the fic to mix up opponents more. Some matches could be really intersting.
<p></p>EDIT: @JT: It <em>is</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">Weaksauce Weakness</a>,  but only her allies know about it and her power is pretty game breaking in other respects.

            Doesn't Velvet have that same power,  except instead of Funny,  her powers can only do things that are scary?
<p></p>It actually makes sense that velvet has both that power AND the power to weaponize her own blood... because PINKIE has two powers too
<p></p>Her versimilimancy and her Pinkie Sense

            @Ginger: It's possible. We haven't confirmed that Red Velvet's other powers are versimilimancy yet. They might be something completely new. But it would make sense based on what you mentioned and the fact that her powers have been terrifying.

            Hey Ginger,  did you ever finish Serenity yet? If so,  what are your thoughts on it overall {Remember to use spoiler text when talking about the second half of the film. Just thought I'd remind you since I'm sure that their are plenty of people on this thread who haven't seen it yet}?

            @Ginger: Yeah,  there's a reason that I went almost the opposite direction when defining Pinkie's powers for my own fanfic. Though they also have some limitations that might seem very weird and arbitrary. Still,  they make sense to me.
