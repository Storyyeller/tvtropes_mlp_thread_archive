            <div class="quoteblock">@kegi it's worse than that,  see,  the people in the stables are expected to have kids. Children who hadn't done anything would be born and forced to suffer the same punishment as their parents. This would go on until the end of time potentially. </div>
<p></p>Okay. This is just untrue. In FOE,  Celestia and Luna aren't immortal,  just long lived. So they would have eventually died and released the descendants. As for Scootaloo's actions,  <em>I would have supported them!</em> Her mission was to make sure that they never had a war again. Locking up those responsible is the good and logical and responsible action! As for the descendants,  the same thing happened to most stables. It was just managing as well as stable-Tec could!
<p></p>I was in support of most of the canon characters decision throughout the fic! They were trying to do <em>good</em> things. As for why the Mane 6 were in charge of ministries,  they didn't ask to be,  they were <em>asked</em> to be by Luna and helped as best they could.
<p></p>As for the zebras,  they get a lot of unnescesary flak. They were <em>terrified</em> and for <em>good reason</em>! If I was a zebra,  I'd have done the same! They were convinced that Luna was going to enslave the world in endless suffering. Of course it was their responsibility to do anything to stop that!
<p></p>So yeah,  I really enjoyed FOE and considered everything justified and in character. The only issue it had (which was due to something revealed after it was too late to fix it) was that in canon,  windigos would prevent it from happening.
<p></p>So yeah,  the early chapters aren't great,  but after that,  it's an excellent story that I recommend. And I knew nothing about Fallout before reading it (and still know very little about it).
<p></p>EDIT: Did I kill the thread?

            I noticed something interesting: in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic.html">this "A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2" preview screenshot<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  Shining Armor's eyes look normal,  but in the actual episode he's got <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControlEyes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControlEyes">Mind-Control Eyes</a> then...was the preview screenshot just unfinished,  or did they purposely edit his eyes? Well,  either way it's a case of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer">Never Trust a Trailer</a>

            I just noticed that Shining Armor's facial expression is also different in that preview screenshot. I bet they did edit it on purpose,  since showing him mind-controlled in a screenshot of the wedding ceremony would be a lot more noticeable than showing him like that in a short out-of-context clip in a commercial.
