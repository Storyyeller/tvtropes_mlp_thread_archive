            I actually enjoyed 'Shy having Angel tie her up.  I was reminded to some degree of Odysseus ordering his men to lash him to the mast so he may here the Siren's song as he didn't trust that he'd be able to resist their call otherwise.

            Cute episode,  it's only possible problem is the same as most other 'The Doormat Gains A Backbone' plots in that to get the point across the rest of the cast are exagerrated into complete bullies.
<p></p>I have to agree with a previous statement from ilsemmir,  Fluttershy seems a bit more three dimentional now,  maybe because she was less of a supporting 'reactor' to others and even the sole character in some scenes. This is why I like shows with <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">character centric rotations</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinnieThePooh" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinnieThePooh">Winnie the Pooh</a> was very similar,  nearly every character gets a moment as the star and thus the cast comes off very three dimentional. I should be ashamed for liking both utterly saccharine kids shows but they're so depthful and charming.

            I have to admit it was kinda cool to see Pinkie and Rarity hanging out.  I wouldn't have expected them to interact much without the other ponies around,  so seeing that they're good friends even without all the other ponies around was a nice touch.
<p></p>Also,  currently working on the review.  Fortunately I don't have too much schoolwork this weekend.  Unless I just forgot something which is entirely possible.

They weren't really doing anything or going someplace they just seemed to be there for no real discernible reason other then the script said so.
<p></p>By the way,  does anyone think that Fluttershy was being honest with her rants or was she just looking for stuff just to insult them?

            I think most of Fluttershy's rants were mainly saying things to hurt Rarity and Pinkie.  I can't help but feel there was a kernel of truth in there somewhere though.  I can easily imagine her as someone who jut compartmentalizes any negative feelings towards people.

            I think there's a tiny grain of truth to what she was saying,  but she exaggerated it an enormous amount to have maximum effect.  I seriously doubt she really thinks of her friends like that.

            Yeah... I didn't like how everybody was a jerk in this episode. When I read the synopsis,  I thought that is was unintentional jerkiness,  like she didn't have enough presence and people cut in line,  or she's so shy that people block her way,  or unintentionally take advantage of her,  etc. It just looked kind of weird to have some ponies being really mean....
