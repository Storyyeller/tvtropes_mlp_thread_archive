            IMO,  Chrysailis and her crew are just a bunch of power-hungry psychos who just prefer to eat love in the more fatal way instead of just naturally feeding off of it like other changelings probably do. I'm sure that there are changelings who are capable of genuiene love {Romantic or Platonic} just like ponies are,  it's just that Chrysailis isn't one of them. Or maybe I just despise the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> trope too much {Certain exceptions aside} and prefer <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Dark is not evil</a>.

            I suppose the damning evidence is that if they were capable of love,  they could just feed off one another without needing to go after other species. On the other hoof,  maybe they are capable of love,  but loving somepony else causes their love-vamping to reverse and their energy goes into the target of their affections.
<p></p>This suggests that a changeling couple in love could form a stable feeding loop,  unless of course the process is anything less than 100% efficient,  because any energy lost in transit would need to be recovered from a third source. And,  of course,  there's the matter of unrequited love,  and the question of whether love is binary or a spectrum,  because in the latter case even a mutual love between two changelings would result in one exhausting their energy without a third party source if they were more in love with their partner than their partner is with them.
<p></p>No wonder they simply find it easier to vamp off other species they have no affection for or attraction to.

            It's possible that their love is simply of a different 'spectrum' of the kind they need to survive. Like,  a horse <em>can</em> eat meat - they can digest it,  because meat and plants are made up of the same stuff. But because a horses digestive system is only <em>designed</em> to pull nutrients out of plant protein,  they get nothing from eating meat. So it's possible that they can only gain life-energy from a kind of love that has something else mixed in. Pony-Magic-Love,  maybe. Their respective magics are represented differently,  so may in fact have different sources.
<p></p>...also on that note,  am I remembering incorrectly or do Spike and the Changelings have the same magic effect?

<p></p>These thins are always far less than 100% efficient. That's why they need to eat in the first place.

            I've just seen The Cutie Pox and now I OFFICALLY HATE EPISODES REGARDING THE CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS! Let me just get this out right now,  I have never been a fan of episodes regarding the Cutie Mark Crusaders,  while this episode is only focusing on Apple Bloom only and not all of the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMCs">CM Cs</a> I do think however that Apple Bloom works better when she's paired up with Applejack. And I guess this episode would be good if they were finally wrapping up this plot line but no it has to tell us YET AGAIN that they are looking for their talents! And it's been going on for THREE FUCKING EPISODES FOR ME! I've absolutely had it with this plot line and I wish they would stop making more episodes about this and just get to the point already! Okay I get it,  they are trying to find their cutie marks NOW GET THE FUCK ON WITH IT! In short,  I hated this episode,  it's cliched,  it's redundant and I just wish this plot line would just fucking end already.
Ok rant over time to move on to the next episode for me.

            Thankfully,  the others are better episodes. It may just have to do with compression,  but I've gotten the impression their crusading's being restrained a bit to focus more on characterization in season 3 at least.

            If there's two things that need to be brought back into the show,  it's A: RD and AJ's rivalry,  and B: AJ's stubborness. The latter trait especially brought some amusing moments in the show,  but the writers apparently forgot about it and now she's just a supporting character who's unfit to get her own solo episode now {Apple Family Reunion} or even sharing an episode with certain characters {Spike At Your Service} because she just feels bland compared to the rest of the mane 6.
<p></p>Speaking of Spike At Your Service,  there's something I wish we knew: If it was changed because Rarity came off as being too mean in the original script,  why couldn't they have just,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">oh I don't know</a>,  rewrite her dialouge so that she doesn't come off as being mean instead of shafting her and giving her no focus in the third season whatsoever?

            Alright so I'm overacting on this but you forget guys I'm ONLY on season 2 and whether or not you guys like the episodes for them,  I still hate the last episode I saw,  okay? I'm aware people like these episodes centred around the Cutie Mark Crusaders and I'm not gonna bash you guys for it and more power to you otherwise,  but honestly I'm just tired of seeing this plot in general and just couldn't stand The Cutie Pox. But ya know what? Maybe that episode was just a one off for me and if you guys gets better from here then give you the benefit of the doubt. But anyways that's just my opinion,  end of story.

            @Starscream: Your entitled to your opinon. Honestly I don't like most CMC episodes either. But while the next episode your about to watch does focus on Sweetie Belle {And Rarity},  it's much better then the other CMC episodes and it doesn't involve Cutie Marks at all. In fact it's probably one of my favorite episodes of S2.

            Yeah,  the CMC sort of move away from Cutie Mark stuff for the most part. It's sort of there,  like in "Ponyville Confidential, " but it isn't the main focus. Then there's stuff like "Hearts & Hooves Day" (great episode,  by the way) and "One Bad Apple" where it doesn't focus on it at all.

            @Marston  Huh? Oh no I actually have seen The Sisterhooves Social and I do think it was a better episode than The Cutie Pox but that was not the episode I was ranting about,  The Cutie Pox was the one I was mad about. But whatever slight technicalities whatever. I'm on May the Best Pet Win hopefully it'll be much better than the Cutie Pox.

            Listening to a stream of Bronycan,  and the auctioning is insane. A dude payed $400 for a wood cut-out of the con's alicorn oc. And yet somehow a chubby plush of Vinyl only sold for 110.
