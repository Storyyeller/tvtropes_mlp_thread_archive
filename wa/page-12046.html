            Celestia's ultimate gambit is to groom ponies who can take care of themselves. She wants to be less alone,  so she trains promising ponies to be as competent as she is,  or at least as close as possible. That way,  no matter what happens to her,  there'll be worthy successors.

            @Enlong: Yeah,  pretty much.  Sombra has all the hallmarks of being a really interesting villain; possibly one of the most interesting in the show.  The problem is that we don't get to actually see him <em>act</em> other than at the very end.

            I think it's more,  L Mage,  that there's a lot of things,  magically inclined of course,  that are fueled by emotion and unity. The heart of fire from the creation myth,  the Elements of Harmony (which I think is the same principle as the heart of fire,  just split into six distinct facets),  the power of love in a number of different formats,  and now the Crystal Heart.

            I probably would be more disappointed with Sombra if they had <em>tried</em> to focus on him and failed to make him interesting,  rather than just not emphasizing him.  As it was,  the writers pretty much just said "here is a threat so the story can progress.  Okay,  now let's focus on what the protagonists are doing."  And they did that bit well,  and they gave him just enough focus that he didn't feel like an element of an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot">Excuse Plot</a>.

            more like Magic fueled by emotion is the most powerful magic,  but not the only type of magic I'd say.
<p></p>Yeah I mean no one is saying Sombra was bad,  or anything,  just that he didn't get enough screen time or development,  but everything we DID see was great
