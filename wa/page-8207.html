<p></p>Yeah,  that was pretty much my criticismâ€”Dumbledore was coming from a position of omniscient third-party knowledge,  Gandalf had to act on not-omniscient first-party knowledge.
<p></p>That's why it always annoys me when people complain about fictional characters doing things that are "stupid" or "illogical."  Rarely is it actually either one.

            I have to say I'm with Ginger on Homestuck,  especially the tropes page. Does the trope page for it really have to look like such a fucking mess that could put my messy room to shame? And the story doesn't sound all that intreasting either.
<p></p>No offense to anyone who likes Homestuck of course. If you like it,  then who am I to stop you from reading it?

            The trope page is indeed a mess. Although I guess that's because there's a lot in the story? Honestly,  I'd say it's better to go into it with knowing as little as possible. Reading the trope page wouldn't help. <br>I don't think AH is that bad,  but maybe I just forgot the parts with him. <br> <br>Chada,  your video appears broken.

            no,  his spirit does not get sent to a horcruxe at all,  basicly as long as horcruxe exists,  all that happens if his body dies is the physical meat drops,  and his spirit is left standing where the body was to go on it's way. (well bit more complex then that but essentially.)

            All I can say is,  I would be more interested if someone wrote <em>Twilight Sparkle and the Methods of Rationality.</em>  Would probably still be completely wrong,  but at least a cute pony is easier for me to palate than some damn wizard from an overrated line of children's books.

<p></p>Personal,  but I also despise how it seems to have fallen under the protection of what I like to call "The Kubrick Defence" where the fans consider the work immune to criticism because aparently the author is so smart that he intended fucking EVERYTHING. INCLUDING the elements that are being criticized... making the criticisms invalid because the Author planned it -_-
