            I had the unpleasant experience of reading that fic on DA,  Psyga.
<p></p>The first part is complete <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateFic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateFic">Hate Fic</a> tripe,  but the second part was <em>much</em> better,  though the fact that it doesn't have Twilight and Cadance apologizing for their temper tantrums <em>does</em> hurt it a little.

<p></p>Well,  there's What's Eating Rainbow Dash... and... um...
<p></p>That one comic that ended with a depressed filly and a trashbin full of Mare-Do-Well junk... and... um...
<p></p>Huh. I guess it's the seriousness that caused the Accusations. Think about it: The ponies in MDW were saving lives,  and the most assholish thing they did was making another pony look bad by comparison. ACW? They ignored someone's warnings (or rather interpreted it as jerkass behavior),  left a pony to sulk at the altar,  having her feelings utterly shattered,  and only got the message that something was seriously wrong too late,  with the result being a full-out invasion happening,  where the only reason why they're saved is because the person organizing the invasion was too confident for her own good.
<p></p>From multiple standpoints,  you have lots of reasons to call out the ponies compared to MDW. The invasion is <strike>possibly</strike> more damaging than some masked superhero going around and making another pony look bad. I suggest reading up on Families,  since it digs into some consequences from the mistakes taken in ACW that didn't have to do with Twilight being ditched by her friends.

            Yeah. I think the reasoning is because the consequences could just be drawn rather than told through words.
<p></p>I have yet to see a comic that pokes fun at the idea of the wedding being held moments after a massive invasion that probably costed a few lives,  injured multiple people,  and broke a few buildings. It was only mentioned <em>once</em> in a commentary,  but never for a comic.

            They didn't kill either the nominal ruler of the then-provincial holding OR the actual queen.  Of course they couldn't in a kids' show,  but I don't see why they would purposefully kill anyone they could just as easily just subdue.

            There's a possibility that the havoc caused by the initial invasion could cause some casualties,  be it by Changelings not watching where they're going and accidentally hitting someone or by hitting a building and causing structural damage that would kill someone later.
<p></p>But on the whole,  the Changelings see ponies as a foodsource,  and one that needs to be alive. They have no reason to kill,  the invasion was likely just intended to cause enough confusion that they could establish themselves with families that had been separated.

            I know what I'm doing wrong with this comic.  I don't have character bios,  and I don't have detailed concept pages like those that professionals use.  That has to change.
<p></p>I need to make a schedule.  Take a character and make concept pages for them...proper concept pages showing front and back views,  multiple expressions,  close up details and accessories etc...print them off and stick them up on the wall...constantly refer to them (embarreshment has prevented me from doing that before,  but the cats out of the bag now)...then write scripts for one off character establishing comics to build their characters.  Things like the crew interacting etc.  And including things like cm origin stories,  life before the story proper etc.  I know you guys have told me to do that already (especially you JT) but my difficulty in actually drawing them is stopping me from getting to that stage.  It'll have to wait this weekend (uni project is due y'see) but from Monday on,  it'll be time to kick it up.  Seriously,  it's been too long.  I hope the worries that have been plaguing me recently will go now that I have money again.
<p></p>And of course,  detailed character bios too.  That's my problem. If you guys asked me about my characters...I couldn't tell you anything about them!  I'm so inept at this. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
