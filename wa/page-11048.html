            That was a while ago though. We already knew the reasons why every pony looked the same more or less.
<p></p>And then in Season 2 they decided to throw in a few more body shapes just cuz'.

            I have no idea. The perfect stallion song had multiple one-offs,  and you get stuff like Allie Way sprinkled in here and there. Who knows if any of the new models may have been their original body ideas for any of the mane 6.

            Yeah,  they've already established the forms of the Mane Six,  so unless they deliberately introduce a permanent character design evolution over the course of S3,  they'll probably not change too much.
<p></p>It might be interesting to see more unique ponies make comebacks.

            I expect much more unique pony types this season. The crystal ponies will hopefully have really interesting designs. I know they looked pretty normal in that book,  but I want to see the designers go all out with them. Maybe some Crystal Zombies or something.

<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/08/shards-of-equestria-recieves-cease-and.html">Shards Of Equestria gets the C&amp;D boot<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<p></p>Fun fact: Hasbro owns Wizards of the Coast and thus the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicTheGathering" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a> Franchise. They thus own both IP in this.
<p></p>Fun Fact: They are issuing the C&amp;D on grounds of (1) losing sales of legit expansions to unofficial  sets,  and (2) they might have a Pony cardgame in the works.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">waffle911: Many folks,  both at DHX and Hasbro,  already know of Fighting is Magic and many other fan projects,  so here's my theory as to why yours got singled out. I think Hasbro's biggest concern here was not the infringement of MLP trademarks,  but the potential loss of profit from folks playing their game with non-official cards that were not purchased from <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WotC" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WotC">Wot C</a>—which is an infringement on the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MtG" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MtG">Mt G</a> trademarks,  which are very likely under an entirely different set of corporate rules from the MLP IP due to the differences in medium,  marketing,  distribution,  the grounds of the IP,  and the different ways in which the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MtG" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MtG">Mt G</a> franchise can be infringed upon and exploited. They don't want folks playing their card game (the the game play mechanics,  rule sets,  and derivations thereof,  in whole or in part) for free—which is what Shards of Equestria would allow for—because <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WotC" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WotC">Wot C</a> and Hasbro have invested a lot of money into the game's development. Fighting is Magic,  My Little Investigations,  and even <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterAge" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterAge">Master Age</a>'s MLPCCG,  however,  do not use any Hasbro properties in any way,  shape,  or form that circumvent the purchase and use of existing Hasbro products,  since they are all novel applications with no Hasbro-sanctioned alternatives. Sure,  they don't make official MLP-themed <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MtG" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MtG">Mt G</a> cards,  but they do still make <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MtG" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MtG">Mt G</a> cards,  and they expect people to make purchases in order to play their game.
<p></p>It's not even a matter of whether or not you make any money off it; it's a matter of them not making money. While your project might seem like small potatoes in the grand scheme of things,  put it was much more likely to gain traction than many other fan-made card set projects; it's more of a slippery slope where if they allow one such project to go through like this,  it opens the door for others like it,  including commercially produced sets by third-party companies…partially as a result of trademark and copyright laws both in the U.S. and abroad. And if everyone were to start making their own <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MtG" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MtG">Mt G</a> sets rather than buying official <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WotC" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WotC">Wot C</a> sets,  then where would that leave them? Not to mention,  there's no way they could sanction or support the use of third-party sets within the existing game because there's no way to ensure that cards are balanced according to their extensive (and proprietary) card design policies.
<p></p>Mind you,  people do play with real <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MtG" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MtG">Mt G</a> card sets illegally over the internet; but the whole way that works out makes it a bit harder for Hasbro to decisively act upon it,  as it's a bit more of a distributed effort without any key folks to be able to target. What's more,  and partially because they do use official card sets,  the folks who enable such activities put in place many non-enforceable policies in usage agreements that are just enough to at least partially absolve themselves of liability for the way their handiwork is used by others. It makes for a relatively flimsy legal barrier to be sure,  but it's a barrier nonetheless; and,  when combined with the relatively small pool of players who partake in <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MtG" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MtG">Mt G</a> illegally (for now),  it poses enough legal resistance that it currently isn't worth the time and effort of Hasbro's legal team to pursue. You however are one entity that can be singled out,  and due to the very nature of Shards of Equestria as an unofficial expansion,  many of those flimsy end-user policies wouldn't be applicable to what you were doing. As a result,  Hasbro's legal team wouldn't have to do much at all to nip this in the bud.
<p></p>This is just the way I'm seeing things here and now. Someone else might be able to point out a few flaws with my reasoning,  or might have more legal information or expertise to refute anything I've said. </div>

            Hi guys! I have a pony question for you today.
<p></p>Which Pony do you respect the most,  and why? For her world views,  her actions,  or for whatever other reason you have?
<p></p>For me,  It would actually be Pinkie Pie. Because honestly,  more people need her world view of making people happy,  even if she is a bit overzealous at it.

            I respect Applejack for her work ethic and honesty,  I respect how she is stubborn and always dependable and also probably the most mature of all the ponies.  A truly trustworthy person,  somepony who will pull their own weight and help,  somepony almost always there for others.
<p></p>I respect Pinkie Pie for her attempts to make everypony happy.  Genuine empathy,  cheerfulness,  optimism; and an active effort to reach out to the depressed and lonely.  She really cares about others and remembers things about them.
<p></p>I respect Rarity for how much she always gives for her friends,  especially how she gives her time.  Rarity didn't have to be friends with a tomboyish,  rash,  brash,  Rainbow Dash; a down-to-earth,  no-frills,  no-nonsense Applejack,  an immature,  hyperactive Pinkie Pie; or an overly bookish Twilight.  None of them can truly appreciate her art the way that she does,  none of them are like her.  They're different,  and they might not like the things that she likes,  but she goes along with it.  She accepts the differences of others,  and gives her time and attention even to those who cannot truly understand the fashion that is so important to her.
<p></p>I respect Fluttershy for her meekness,  empathy,  and pure heart.  Girl basically spends a lot of her time comforting wild animals.  I admire people who are kind and gentle.  She's a truly caring little pegasus.
<p></p>I admire Rainbow Dash for obvious reasons.
<p></p>I admire Twilight for reasons that are apparent to anypony who watches the show.

            Out of the cast,  I think I'd probably respect AJ the most,  for the combo of work ethic and her desire to be as helpful as possible in a given situation,  mainly because I suffer from a severe lack of both.  Not that I don't respect the other ponies,  (they all have their good points) but I think AJ is probably the most reasonable about how she goes about things; the rest of the cast tend to be a lot more extreme than she does.  Like,  I can respect Pinkie's desire to make other ponies happy,  but I think she <em>severely</em> overdoes it a lot of the time,  which knocks her down a few notches.  Not that AJ doesn't overdo it,  but she doesn't overdo it nearly as often,  or in such an extreme fashion.  Same deal with Twilight,  I admire her dedication to studying and planning,  but she regularly overdoes it.
