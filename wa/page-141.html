<p></p>I must agree with Fawriel; her characterization is really awesome in this episode. I can only imagine sad and grimdark fics will be written in spades for Pinkie now. It also seem rather hypocritical that Pinkie can't stand when secrets are kept from her; despite her being all "FOREVER" in <em>Green isn't Your Color</em>.
<p></p>Also,  anypony get some Ren&amp;Stimpy vibes during Pinkie's breakdown? Like,  with all the crazy backgrounds and whatnot?

<p></p>It's because her friends were lying and they made up excuses. She understood that it was a surprise party once she remembered the reason.

            I honestly thought the pnoies were ignore Pikie Pie because they didn't want to kill themselves partying. It wasn't until Twilight was sneaking around with the package that I thought a surprise party might be involved. I actually didn't want that to happen,  not because it was so cliched but beacause Gummy just had a party the day before,  and what are the odds of having two birthdays in a row? Then it occured to me that Gummy may have been a birthday present for Pinkie Pie somehow.
<p></p>How well acquainted were the Man cast before Twilight arrived? We know Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash know each other from Cloudsdale and Pinkie Pie said she knew "everypony in town, " but what about the others?"
<p></p>Also,  we need fan art of Rocky,  Lintsalot and the rest.

            Pinkie's attitude in Green is not Your Color was really more about keeping your friend's secrets,  not keeping your own secrets from friends.
<p></p>Sanity slippage along with weird backgrounds did indeed remind me of Ren and Stimpy.

Pinkie and Dash didn't really click until Griff and Brush Off and Rainbow Dash seemed genuinely annoyed with Pinkie before they realized what they had in common. Whether or not Rarity and Fluttershy knew each other before is questionable. On the one hand they seem friendly enough with one another to have been,  on the other hand I think Rarity would've <em>known</em> Fluttershy knew a thing or two about fashion had that been the case.
<p></p>And as for the episode itself,  I was expecting and would've been more accepting of a "Not everyone can party all the time,  they can be tired or have lives" as a lesson for Pinkie. The other one just left me with one big annoyed "meh."

            Even without using that specific moral,  I would have liked it if they showed Pinkie feeling worse about how she acted throughout the episode (like Spike's interrogation and freaking everyone out). Sometimes it seems like Pinkie can get away with anything.

<p></p>At the same time,  there must have been something they initially bonded over,  and it's possible that Rarity did know that Fluttershy knew a thing about sewing and fashion,  just not nearly as much as she did once Rarity backed her up against the wall. Which makes me wonder just what kind of situation would come up that would give Flutter to make mention of those skills when she's not the kind to make much of anything about what she is and isn't capable of doing.

            Rewatching this last episode,  when Rainbow Dash says "You heard her,  construction!" there's a part where all the other ponies seem to spontaneously shout "Safety Gear!" It made me chuckle.

            I don't think Rarity would need to know about Fluttershy's fashion knowledge to bond with her.  Fluttershy seems like the pony Rarity would hang out with the most anyway.  We've seen Rarity butt heads with Applejack,  and Rainbow Dash is probably a bit too hectic for her.  And Pinkie Pie is crazy.
