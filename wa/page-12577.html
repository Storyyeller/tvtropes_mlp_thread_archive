            Why do people keep talking about how erratic the last season was? At this point last season, I'd say it was actually even better.
<p></p>The two-parter last time delivered the greatest villain in the series, that followed with the most amazing <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a>, and then curiously enough episodes focused on Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom alone. The only episode that was simply good was the Luna episode, which was dragged down by the third act.
<p></p>Season 2 was all A-list episodes except for "Luna Eclipsed" until the 8th episode.
<p></p>It's slightly better than the first season, both have 4 A-listers, but "Boast Busters" was abysmal compared to the average "One Bad Apple".

Maybe not disowning but showing strong dislike for part of an episode,  I think the only instance she has for one so far.

It also started a lot of key evolution critisms with the characters or story (eg. AJ being <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a>,  RD being Flanderized into a Jerkass). Things toned down by the end of it,  but it still seemed to have more vocal polarizing views than the first and third thus far.

<p></p>Opinions,  etc,  etc. What you think about the episodes is not what other people think about the episodes. I find the quality to be pretty even across all of the episodes,  with differing styles and focuses resulting in differing preferences,  as well as significant animation improvements over time.

I analyzed the differences between the seasons pretty heavily and came to the conclusion that the seasons were more or less comparable in quality.  Season two has more episodes that tend to skew towards either end of the spectrum,  while Season one has a more consistent level of quality.
<p></p>I mean,  you can pick <em>any</em> episode and probably find people who think it's either the best or worst episode of the show. Case in point,  I'm sure there are people who would take extreme issue with the fact that you think "One Bad Apple" is better than "Boast Busters".

<p></p>I've seen bile from many more "passionate fans" however.
<p></p>I admit I tend to go back to Season Two episodes less often than Season One (par odd exceptions such Lesson Zero). They just seemed to have some of the better moments of character chemistry to me that give more repeat value.

            My point is Season 3 isn't done yet and it isn't quite right to make a statement like that until it's done.
<p></p>Season 1 I found after the first 6 got better for the most part, while Season 2 mostly got worse.
<p></p>Season 3 could go either way, hopefully it will go in the positive direction of season 1 while being more daring like season 2.
<p></p>It still surprises me what does and doesn't merit serious controversy sometimes. For example the God's statement on the moral of "Feeling Pinkie Keen" even though it is an important moral albeit family unfriendly and the Bowlderized analogue to natives and settlers even though it was peacefully settled and they came to understand.
<p></p>These Polsky episodes seem to be hated for being unfriendly and idealistic
<p></p>But the fandom almost ignores that Spike became a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot">Boomerang Bigot</a>, and stole an egg rather than simply waited and apologized to the phoenixes, and the ponies are serious fantastic racists.
<p></p>Oh well fandoms are crazy.

            I have to agree with the previous statement that Season Two was taking more risks and innovations than Season One,  that was more laid back and standard fun plots. It toyed with the characters and setup a bit more and offered a bit more continuity. As a result,  the quality lingers,  it has some of the most revolutionary episodes,  and some of the more 'better on paper' ones.
<p></p>This is actually often a standard with many series,  the first season is usually there for basic establishment and to get fans aqquainted with the setup and characters. The later ones however will try more innovations and toy with the main plot more,  depending on how they take things,  the second season can either be worse or better than the later ones (either due to some rough spots in working out which direction to take,  or due to the direction being bad and early episodes being better for following the original setup more).

            @Psi that pretty much sums it up.  S2 took more risks.  Sometimes it works,  sometimes it doesn't.  The best of S2 is better than the best of S1,  but the worst of S2 is worse than the worst of S1.
