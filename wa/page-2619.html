            I think that RS,  Mio,  and Fallen sum it up quite nicely.  The cutie mark is so closely related to the pony's identity that it's <em>always</em> going to represent them in some way.  Granted they themselves might interpret it differently twenty years down the road,  but I don't think they ever hit a point where they feel it doesn't represent them <em>at all</em>.  They probably just realize that it bears additional significance that they didn't realize at first.
<p></p>And I also feel the need to re-emphasize that as far as we know <em>it's impossible for a pony to get a cutie mark they don't want</em>.  You get the CM when you find your purpose in life,  it's not like you get a symbol at random and you had better hope you like it.
<p></p>@Urdthe: Even in that case there's room for interpretation.  Like Silver Spoon being a silversmith or the owner of a fancy restaurant,  or Diamond Tiara being a jeweler or something.

            Honestly... I think the idea that in 20 years and see someone completely different is kind of nice. It's alright to have some sort of constant I guess,  but I don't like the idea of just sitting in the same spot for my entire life. I think the cutie mark may have a sort of inherent notion,  but nothing specific. Like,  Twilight's mark might represent potential - as she is now it could be about exploring her potential,  making it a mark about learning. But in 20 years she might have let go of trying to find her potential,  and focused on helping other find <em>their</em> potential. Suddenly she becomes a teacher,  something far away from her current role.
<p></p>Everything must change. Something can have the same elements,  but it must still move along,  and grow. It only makes sense that the meaning of a mark could grow as well. It's not a genetic thing,  or a species trait. It's a law of reality. Everything must change.

<p></p>What about people who were born wanting to be filmakers,  and spent their entire life making films. Are you saying that at some point they should just STOP wanting to make films because "no change is bad!"

            @Ginger: Woops.  Sorry,  too many posts all at once.
<p></p>@Kegisak: Nobody's saying that ponies can't change,  just that the cutie mark never becomes irrelevant to them.  It'll always represent them in <em>some</em> way,  even if not in the same way that it represented them when they first got it.  Like I can see Twilight doing different things,  but she's always going to find meaning in her cutie mark.

            Well,  no. Though I believe I can say that noone is <em>born</em> wanting to do something. I'm simply saying that they <em>can</em> change. Yes,  there can be a constant. But there can also be someone or somepony without a constant. Even if there is theoretically a constant,  somethng huge could still happen t change your life.

            <div class="quoteblock">onestly... I think the idea that in 20 years and see someone completely different is kind of nice. It's alright to have some sort of constant I guess,  but I don't like the idea of just sitting in the same spot for my entire life. I think the cutie mark may have a sort of inherent notion,  but nothing specific. Like,  Twilight's mark might represent potential - as she is now it could be about exploring her potential,  making it a mark about learning. But in 20 years she might have let go of trying to find her potential,  and focused on helping other find their potential. Suddenly she becomes a teacher,  something far away from her current role.
Everything must change. Something can have the same elements,  but it must still move along,  and grow. It only makes sense that the meaning of a mark could grow as well. It's not a genetic thing,  or a species trait. It's a law of reality. Everything must change.</div>
<p></p>That is why i always preferred them being analogous to a "persona" rather then their "true selves".

            I for one,  don't like the idea of being the same person twenty years from now.  I want to be a better me.  I want to have different interests and abilities,  and I don't even mind the idea of no longer liking things that mean a lot to me now.  However,  I have discovered something about myself (personal so I'm not sharing it) that I know will never change.  It's a good thing,  and something I take great comfort in when I need to believe that there is good in me.  You could say that,  in a very limited sense,  I've discovered my cutie mark.

            But how? How can they have an absolute constant? It just doesn't work that way - it's not about genetics,  or about morality,  it's just how the universe is - <em>everything</em> is capable of change. Is there just some part of their brain that contains a single personality trait and resists any change whatsoever?
<p></p>@Mio: Well,  the 'true self' can still change too... but that's beside the point right now,  I think.
