            I thought about declaring that anything seen during an obviously non-literal song number doesn't count,  but that felt too much like a copout to me.
<p></p>I do wonder how that kid can play a game out in the open thoughâ€”game monitors and direct sunlight don't mix well (it makes the game too hard to see... but it looked like the top of the cabinet had a lot of overhang,  so...)
<p></p>(Yeah,  I think about this stuff too much.  Comes from being a gaming enthusiast)

            So ging,  what kind of games you like?  I know you like Resident Evil and I think you've said you've <em>played</em> Contra (which I've now beaten).  So... what else?  Maybe there's some other unexpected overlaps in our tastes.

            Well,  there's some points of commonality there:  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalGearSolid" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a>,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaMan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaMan">Mega Man</a>,  and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalFantasy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a>.
<p></p>Lately I've become a general survival horror nut.  Been thinking about getting <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QplleIOGA">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  simply because the premise alone sounds unique for a video game (if there's one thing that's a turn on for me,  its a unique premise).  Hey,  you ever played the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockTower" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockTower">Clock Tower</a> games?  Scissor Man might not be your idea of a good villain,  but you won't have time to think about that when you're running for your life.

<p></p>Aside from RE,  I've played the original <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentHill" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentHill">Silent Hill</a> on ps1 (quite liked it too). but that's about as far as my survival horror experience goes.
<p></p>I always liked <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSuffering" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSuffering">The Suffering</a>. I always thought that was an underrated game. I mean,  monsters based off of different methods of execution? I'm all FOR symbolic shit like that!
<p></p>Anyway,  I need to go be off now. I hope I have the strength
<p></p>I might try <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockTower" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockTower">Clock Tower</a> at some point though

            I'd say its closer to <em>Halloween.</em>  It's not campy (not until the license got bought out by Capcomâ€”which was the very last game in the series).
<p></p>Basically,  it plays like a traditional point-n-click adventure gamem like <em>5 Days a Stranger</em> or something (don't worryâ€”puzzles are practically nonexistant and super-easy to solve,  at least in the ones I've played),  except every once in awhile you'll run into Scissorman.  Now here's the deal:  you can't kill Scissorman,  not until the endgame.  Sometimes the room has objects you can attack him with,  but most of the time,  you have to escape.  Find a hiding place,  run into the bathroom and lock the door,  crawl through a hole in the wall he can't fit through.  Then,  once you lose him,  you can go back to piecing together the mystery.  It's a short game,  but there are like ten endings,  which one you get depends on various choices made throughout,  so lots of replay value.
<p></p>That's for the original SNES version (available as a translated ROM or even as a Repro Cart now).  The Playstation sequel (released in America as simply "Clock Tower" since we never officially got the first) I've never played,  but I've heard its even scarier because Scissorman can come after you at any time and sometimes he can even find your hiding spots,  whereas in the first game he tends to only appear on cue and the same spots and traps will always work.  It's still an awesome game though,  and it will probably scare you silly.  I'm used to horror,  and I was honestly kind of intimidated the first time I played.
<p></p>So that's my recommendation:  give it a go.
<p></p>EDIT:  There were two more games in the seriesâ€”<em>Clock Tower: Ghosthead</em> (released as "Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within" in the USA) for Playstation one,  which was honestly where the series entered its decline,  and then it all ended with <em>Clock Tower 3</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS2" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS2">PS2</a>.  This one was developed by Capcom and... basically,  they killed it.  They totally effing destroyed it.  It's one of the few things I can never forgive Capcom for.
<p></p>So play the first two games,  but skip the last two.
