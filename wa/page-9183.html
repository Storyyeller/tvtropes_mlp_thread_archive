<p></p>Apparently bottling up emotions is bad later in life,  so I'm thinking of letting off some steam sometime. Maybe punch a pillow or yell at a tree.

            About the gender neutral pronoun debate,  someone asked why "he" isn't used anymore in a gender neutral sense.  This is mainly because many women,  including myself,  don't like to be referred to as men,  just like most men wouldn't like being called "she."  Mainly because it encourages the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreGenericWomenAreSpecial" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreGenericWomenAreSpecial">Men Are Generic, Women Are Special</a> trope.  I use both "they" or "he or she" depending on the context,  I would probably use the former in an informal situation but use the latter in a formal school paper type of situation.  English is rather lacking in a gender neutral pronoun that doesn't dehumanize the person being talked about (most men AND women wouldn't like being called an "it" either).
<p></p>By the way,  I really liked that picture of Pinkie with the baby versions of the other ponies.  Reminds me of one of my favorite Pinkie episodes ever,  Baby Cakes. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">

            I prefer the passive-aggressive approach and make the people before me feel stupid through carefully chosen phrases,  it's very cathartic.
<p></p>Actually I don't prefer it it's a pain in the rear and almost makes me worse than aggressive bullies and makes it look like I have more self-esteem than I actually do (ie. None),  Is it my fault everything looks obvious to me?
<p></p>....
<p></p>I've suddenly realized why I didn't apply for a new job months ago: FILLING OUT JOB APPLICATIONS IS A FLIPPING PAIN!
<p></p>You put in hours and hours of meaningless tedium for an answer that may or may not come? "Applying Online" is the worst decision ever made by existence.
<p></p>In the time it would take for me to fill out some meaningless questionarre I could have two tumblr updates or something. No wonder people stay miserable in the same jobs forever,  it's too much trouble to switch!
