            Ever since Storyeller linked to his post of the day,  I've been reading several older post's from this thread {From around late February 2012},  and honestly,  people always joke about how "Insane" this thread is,  but personally I think it was way weirder back then. If anything the thread has mellowed out considerably.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            As far as archetypes go... I'm not sure you could really call them 'good'. The line between an archetype and a steryotype is dangerously thin - the use of girly archetypes in the show could be seen as a Deconstruction,  in a way,  in that the point of using them was to show,  A),  there's lots of ways to be a girl,  and B) Girls <em>aren't</em> definied by specific traits. There isn't 'the tomboy' and 'the fashinista'; girls are like boys in that they're defined by a multitude of traits and are far deeper than the cliches one assumes.
<p></p>An archetype is usually a shorthand for a character,  a way to give the audience context to build on,  or assumptions for the writer to break down - assumptions made about Rarity as 'the girly girl',  for example,  have been smashed straight to bits over the course of the series.
<p></p>To use a more in depth example(Because I made it,  shill shill shill) in Ask Hoops and Dumbbell,  Dumbbell is a common gay archetype(Or rather,  a few kinda melded together). He about 15% gym bunny,  60% <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyGay" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyGay">Manly Gay</a> and 25% low-self-esteem gay. Gym Bunny and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyGay" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyGay">Manly Gay</a> come about largely through his character in the show proper,  so there's not much to explain there - although I do use it to draw a contrast with the much more mellow Hoops largely for the sake of their relationship dynamic - but the self-hating,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmouredClosetGay" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmouredClosetGay">Armoured Closet Gay</a> elements are done deliberately to give rise to multiple issues,  namely confronting the way that society contrasts homosexuality with what's deemed traditionally masculine. Though Dumbbell is by far the more traditionally masculine of the two,  the apparantly dominant personality in the relationship and(Spoilered for TMI) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Far more likely to initiate sexual encounters normally</span>,  He's still <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The bottom,  and actually enjoys being led about in bed</span>.
<p></p>The point there was to have him simultaniously fill the 'man' and 'woman' roles in the relationship,  to show that the idea of genders rolls in a relationship are inherently false. I used the archetype as a deconstruction of a perception.
<p></p>Of course,  you probably understand all that on some level and were just looking for the basic archeptypes to play off of... but good things to keep in mind regardless. For Archetypes I can suggest the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongSilentType" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongSilentType">Strong Silent Type</a>,  especially emotional at the core(Think Big Mac),  a Class Clown type(Imagine Pinkie but as a dude and everything that comes with testosterone),  and The Hockey Kid(Which may be a personal archetype from my own experiences,  but in general the hockey kid is brash and confrontational,  but good-naturedly so. As in Hockey,  a fight is just a thing that happens and you get over it and go back to 'fair' play afterwords. Usually.)

<p></p>Obviously a subliminal message to make River beat everyone up.
<p></p>Also @Apple,  have you considered basing them off people you've met? You probably don't want to make it 1 to 1,  but it could give you ideas for different personality traits.

            Damn,  didn't get the job I interviewed for last week.
<p></p>Ah well,  that just means one thing: More job applications!
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> I know that I shouldn't exactly expect to get the first job I go for and all,  and the fact that getting a job generally means you DON'T apply means that rejections are kinda part of the process,  but it's REALLY hard to keep up motivation to apply when I seem to get rejected from everything I apply to,  even when I DO have experience in that job.</span>

            So I've decided to follow story's advice and to start using people I know as templates for characters.  I had thought of it myself before but,  converting real peoples personalities into pony ones true to the spirit of the show has proved to be surprisingly difficult.
<p></p>Also,  as I may be leaving home soon (very unsure atm) I might disappear for a while.  Unless my phone coverage stays OK.  And,  to be honest...I'm not sure I want to come back as Applelight Limited.  There's too much drama attached to this handle.  But with my OTC block it would be ban evading.  So...I guess the thing to do would be to sort that out first.

            Maybe you could ask the mods? If you tell them that it's your new account,  then it wouldn't be ban evading.

<p></p>Sorry you didn't get that one mate.  But keep trying.

<p></p>I guess I could.  The options are either I tell them the new handle and they slap a block on it or I resolve the block to begin with.  The first one is probably the most likely outcome.
<p></p>I know it's odd but,  I'm pretty much purging myself of my life at the moment.  I'm starting over completely from scratch.  I'm even selling the car.
