            My dad watched it with me (not a second time,  the first time I watched it) and he thought up a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> question.  Basically,  "Why didn't they just make the cake on the site of the contest like in real-life baking contests?"  This was also because he pointed out that the train lurching around and stopping and starting could easily just dump over a creation as fragile as the MMM.  In honor of the Sherlock Holmes parody in the story,  I thought up both Watsonian and Doylist explanations for that:
<p></p>Doylist: Because then they couldn't do the "Murder on the Orient Express" parody properly if the incident didn't happen on a train. (that was the answer I most easily thought of for his question)
<p></p>Watsonian: Perhaps that particular contest was just for judging the entries and didn't have the supplies on hand,  so participants had to bring the entries pre-made.    Also,  trains in Equestria might run smoother than real-life steam trains.
<p></p>I watch the show with my dad sometimes,  but I particularly wanted to show him this story because he LOVES trains and so I thought he'd like a story where almost everything happens on a train.  (yes I also showed him "The Last Round-up" since that one also features the train prominently,  and we've joked that if he was a brony he would probably want the train playset)

<p></p>All of the bakers were annoying as hell.  I hate stereotypes,  not because the offend me,  but because they're boring.  I could pretty much fill in whatever they were going to say before they said it.

            @Rainbow,  they had to stay in Ponyville to take care of the babies and manage the shop. Doughnut Joe had to go to Ponyville to get the supplies. I'm not sure about the others.
<p></p>Also,  Ginger have you tried using a Kindle? I think it might be a better way to read fanfics instead of printing them out.

            I just thought of something,  given that it's the day before Easter (or at least it still is Saturday on my timezone).  I wonder what Christian viewers who gave up sweets for Lent felt about this episode,  given the way the various desserts in the episode were featured so prominently and gushed about so much by the characters?  I know it would be just one more day,  but I just thought it might be hard for someone who is really trying to resist and they watch the show to distract themselves and they end up being bombarded by tempting descriptions of desserts. (although if they knew about the previews and would be that badly affected they might know to wait until tomorrow to watch the episode)
<p></p>@storyyeller: I knew that,  my dad was more wondering why the contest didn't have the materials already there.  It wasn't really condemning the episode (he knew what it was meant to be parodying) but more of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> question.  I've never been to a food contest,  let alone entered one,  but I would assume that some have the materials on site and others require the participants to bring their entries ready-made.

            @Bluespade: Oops,  I didn't know that.  I assumed that most Christians followed the same holiday traditions aside from the saints' days,  which I know are specifically Catholic,  but I guess I just learned something new yet again today.  It's probably because I'm most familiar with the Catholic brand of Christianity,  since both my parents were raised Catholic and my dad's family is especially religious (I'm not sure what my parents' current religious beliefs would count as,  although we don't go to church and they have NO problem with me being an atheist).
