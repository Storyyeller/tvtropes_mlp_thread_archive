            "Hearth's Warming Eve" is to me what "Too Many Pinkie Pies" is to Polsky detractors (which I don't understand at all). I'm not gonna go any farther into the rest (last time I did, it took twenty pages and got a little bit too heated), I'm just gonna say, ..glad it wasn't like that.
<p></p>Also it was good to see Luna, and I'm glad she didn't overshadow.
<p></p>I also noticed (with the exception of "Too Many Pinkie Pies") that not writing to Celestia the moral is commonplace this season.

            @Mio: Pretty much the same for me. They're okay but tend to have more flaws and less compelling plots than some other writers'. Many of my faves tend to be Rogers' or Marrow's episodes.

            I never really liked Hearth's Warming Eve. I never really got into the "fictional" characters that the Mane Six were playing or their story,  and the Mane Six's own behaviour was pretty dumb too.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Morrow's actually written some pretty unpopular episodes actually,  most of them involving younger characters interestingly (though she's probably one of my personal favorites too). When I hear people say their favorite writers it's usually Meghan <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McCarthy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McCarthy">Mc Carthy</a> or M.A. Larson (I actually think <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McCarthy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McCarthy">Mc Carthy</a> is a bit overrated but I like Larson usually).

            Mio: Maybe one thing I specifically like about Rogers' and Marrow's is they are more liable to toy with the main dynamics more and show characters in different roles (eg. Rogers is responsible for nearly all of AJ's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll">Not so Above It All</a> moments,  along with an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> role for Apple Bloom of all people,  while both writers have written most of RD's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartBall" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartBall">Smart Ball</a> ones) making the cast seem more multi faceted.
<p></p>In this sense they are some of my favorites,  but only because they are alongside other writers,  whose work I can actually appreciate more because of it. If they were the only writers I'd likely complain about them being Flanderized. So in a way,  I have favorites,  but near to all of them are pivotal.
<p></p>This is why I think <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a> is such a pivotal trope really. We see all sorts of writers' different takes on the characters,  and they usually all make for one very three dimentional character from all their enterpretations. Shows with only one writer tend to have more limited characterizations and more skewed spotlight to me.

Even in less extreme cases you can pick up on who happens to be writing the character that day if you pay attention enough,  which often leads to people saying they like this writers version of the character better then this version of the character and so on and so forth.
<p></p>I can see the point your trying to make,  but there are also quite a few problems that come with multiple writers.

I do like that the different writers allow for different takes on the characters,  but I also think that some writers stretch the characters to the point where it starts to look inconsistent.
<p></p>I do agree that Williams is far from my favorite writer,  though.  Both MMDW and DQ are near the bottom of my episode lists.  HWE and PYHD were both good,  but not great. I think the issue with her is that she tends to modify the setting and characters to fit the needs of the plot while most of the other writers tend to keep the setting and characters consistent and modify the plot to fit.  Personally,  I think the latter approach fits the character-driven nature of the show more.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">

            I fail to see character contradictions outside of the obvious MMDW flub,  honestly. Can anyone give any examples?

            @Perpetual: I guess it's not quite contradictions so much as characters losing or gaining nuance depending on who's writing them.  Take this episode for example.  I can't honestly say that Rarity is out of character besides being exaggerated a bit,  but she seems really flat and one-dimensional compared to her portrayal in a <em>lot</em> of other episodes (Sisterhooves Social,  Dog and Pony Show,  Green Isn't Your Color,  Sweet and Elite,  etc.) Even episodes like Stare Master or Ponyville Confidential when she didn't have a major role gave her a bit more depth,  whereas here it seems outside her first and last scenes,  her sole character trait seems to be "Doesn't like camping".
<p></p>Again,  it's not inconsistent with her previously established character to act that way,  but it irks me that they didn't really use her for anything except "Lol,  the fancy pony goes camping" jokes.  Those jokes are fine in and of themselves,  but it's <em>all she does until the tail end of the episode</em>.  We've seen in previous episodes that she doesn't always have such an aversion to getting her hooves dirty,  and I find it weird that this episode doesn't touch on that at all.

<p></p>One writer will like this and that character for example,  and have enough understanding of their personality they will try developing them and fleshing them out. They will have less interest in another though,  so put them in the background or use them for more one note roles or gags,  leaving it to another writer to make use of them. With the right diversity of writers and view points it can all be balanced out.

            It's all about focus. You can't see the layers of a character unless you focus on them,  and this episode focused on RD/Scootaloo. All of the episodes you mentioned save Stare Master has significant Rarity focus,  where as here she was very much just along for the ride.

<p></p>Honestly in this show it's only really caused some minor annoyances,  but I still feel that it is something to recognize and if necessary reconcile when you have all of these writers.

            This is my favourite episode of Season 3 so far. Yes,  Rarity's behaviour was quite a bit exaggerated,  and they could have toned it down a little; but all the same,  I really liked it. And I am not usually a fan of the CMC,  so that was a surprise.

            As said I think it's easier to get past because of the many writers. If there was an enterpretation certain fans didn't like,  then it would be a lot harder to bypass if the one writer that created it wrote <em>all</em> of said character's appearances from that point onward.
<p></p>Even at that though I do occasionally find enjoyment when the characters act <em>completely</em> different from how they should. Bridle Gossip took everyone a deranged direction,  but it was actually rather funny because of it.

            @Perpetual: It's not that they didn't focus on those traits,  it's that they didn't so much as <em>mention</em> them. Just because she was a supporting character doesn't mean she needs to become one-dimensional.  It doesn't take much time at all; something as brief as showing her helping to set up the campfire,  or helping to cook or something.  Basically my problem is (and I realize it isn't that big a deal,  I'm just using it as an example),  is that once Sweetie guilts Rarity into going on the trip,  Rarity fights it every single step of the way until the very end.  Like I said,  it's not OOC,  but they could have incorporated more of her previous characterization into it.
<p></p>Basically,  I think it would have been truer to her character if instead of complaining about it the whole way,  she admits that she doesn't like it but still tries to make the most of the situation.
<p></p>My point in bringing up those episodes wasn't to say that she needed that level of depth,  just to point out that we <em>know</em> she has that level of depth,  and this episode ignored it.

            I really like Luna having the power to enter dreams,  because it's just a really nice situation for her.
<p></p>Think about it. The way her job works,  she's nocturnal. She watches over the night,  so she has to sleep during most days. As a result,  she probably doesn't spend a whole lot of time with ponies who aren't night-owls like her.
<p></p>But,  since she can enter dreams,  she can spend time with those who have to sleep at night,  and spend her nights walking through beautiful (or terrifying) dreamscapes.
<p></p>It means her nights don't have to be lonely.

            I almost think that she sometimes seeks <em>out</em> nightmares,  and tries to resolve them like she did in this episode.
