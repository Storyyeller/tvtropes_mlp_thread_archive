            @ Mio,  I can understand that,  and there is a difference between loving somepony,  and loving every single thing about them,  the last is just a bit creepy. And the episode did make clear,  even her closest friends can get exasperated by her at times.

            Maybe it's more like,  yeah they can think of times when Pinkie is annoying (and so can we),  but they agree with the general sentiment of the song.

            You have a character who is clearly portrayed as being in the right disliking Pinkie for a wide variety of reasons throughout the entire episode,  and learns a lesson about personal space and respecting that not everyone is batshit insane. She's being obnoxious but she's doing it in her good way; yes she's annoying Cranky but all the while she comes across as being genuinely well-intentioned instead of the poorly written Pinkie that's just loud and abrasive. Her antics are generally played low-key until the third act,  where she starts to get <em>really</em> pushy,  and she makes a very clear mistake and feels bad about it.
<p></p>This is not just a good Pinkie episode. This is the <em>best</em> Pinkie episode. It is how Pinkie should be behaving <em>all</em> the time. Watch it,  Ginger. You will enjoy it.
<p></p>And if you don't you'll spontaneously combust,  which will at least be fun for me to watch.

            Also,  I'm more then sure that some ponies love Pinkie,  but only in small doses,  they'd get irritated with her after to long.
<p></p>It's the fact that these ponies are believably complex enough that you know for sure they CAN have feelings this complex that makes the show so epic.
<p></p>Besides even without knowing Pinkie,  we know all ofPponyville will join into any musical number they see happening regardless of what's going on.

            @Ginger: You can vent to me,  because I'll probably agree with you.  I didn't really like this episode much myself,  and I'm not a fan of Smile,  Smile,  Smile,  either.  Mainly because I don't think Pinkie ever annoyed me as much as she did in this one before.  This one basically hit MY <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> of being annoyed at being TOLD to smile when I don't feel like it and cemented my view that while Pinkie is an entertaining character to watch sometimes,  she and I would get along like cesium and water in real life (for the non-chemistry people cesium basically explodes in water).  And the fact that he became her friend ANYWAY at the end really annoys me,  how could he like her after she was so annoying and destroyed his stuff and was a crazy stalker?!  I don't think finding Matilda really makes up for it,  Cranky must be more forgiving than me.  The fact that he became her friend anyway kind of invalidates the moral for me,  too,  because she wasn't really shown learning anything.  If anything,  she got even MORE annoying and stalkerish after Twilight and Rainbow Dash called her out on her behavior.
<p></p>I did like the appearance of the babies and Rainbow Dash reading Daring Do,  though,  and I was correct that they were going to do a parody of the "Yankee Doodle Dandy" song.  No feather in a cap or riding on ponies,  though.

            @edvedd: I think that is the more likely interpretation. Plus the opening seen was probably done to contrast what came next.
<p></p>I know that people already know that Pinkie likes to make people happy (YMMV),  but this is a kid's show,  and they must always assume that every episode is someone's first.
<p></p>@Rainbow: I also think that the end invalidates the moral.

            I wonder how Pinkie would react if someone said "I promise I'll smile once YOU go away and leave me alone!"  She was tying with Twilight for my favorite before this,  but this one and some of her other behavior has shoved Applejack up there with Twi for first place,  and now Pinkie is in 2nd place.

            @Rainbow: Honestly in spite of what the show claims I think calling them friends is a bit of a stretch. She did him a solid,  which was enough to make up for what she broke,  and he's in a happier mood in general. He'll be on pleasant terms with her,  but don't expect to see them going bowling anytime soon.

            My main complaint about Smile Smile Smile is that it almost felt like it was trying too hard to sell Pinkie to the audience.  It was basically going "Hey,  everybody loves Pinkie!" a bit too hard. I get that it's supposed to summarize Pinkie's outlook on life; it did that very well,  but at the same time the way <em>everyone</em> joined in gave it an air of "literally <em>everyone</em> likes her".  It just felt a bit over the top.

            I really don't get how people are mad that Pinkie was annoying this episode when she was <em>supposed to be</em>. If she wasn't,  then it a lot of justification for Cranky's behavior just flies right out the window. I mean,  Chariot just so happened to <em>not</em> think Pinkie was annoying,  and look how his opinion of the situation ended up. Having her be more reasonable from the beginning would have pretty much killed the episode's message.
<p></p>It's not like she stopped being funny,  either. I think I laughed more this episode than any other this season. I can only really fault this episode on the ending,  because while they did manage to set it up,  they should have made some mention of Matilda's scrapbook in the opening to have it make sense. Overall,  how good this episode is somewhat depends on whether or not Pinkie continues to respect privacy when asked,  because this was great development for her and it would be a shame for it to go to waste. I still really liked it,  though.

            @Applelight: Yeah,  they hit the moral right on the head,  which I thought was awesome.  And I think they did a great job of making Cranky sympathetic despite his grouchy demeanor.  This episode had it's issues,  but as far as that goes,  they nailed it.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I think the problem some people have is that they were aiming for "she's annoying in show,  but entertaining for the viewer",  and that line is different for everyone.  For the most part I thought it wasn't too bad (although I dislike <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CringeComedy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CringeComedy">Cringe Comedy</a>,  so the scene with the wig was almost painful),  but for some (i.e. Ginger) her antics are just as annoying to the viewer as they are for Cranky.
