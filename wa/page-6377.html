            In what way would Rarity be a superhero? Can't be physical stuff,  she's too afraid to get her hooves dirty. Magic? Telekinesis? But anyone can do that. Well,  any <em>unicorn</em>,  anyway.

            Well Rarity's biggest thing is that she's the one most likely to notice her own flaws,  so she'd see that she's getting big headed about it on her own and try and rein it in. She wouldn't need the others to tell her.
<p></p>Fluttershy would hate having the spotlight
<p></p>Twi already gets paranoid about people thinking she's like Trixie
<p></p>AJ wouldn't let it go to her head,  she'd just accept the tanks and move on
<p></p>Pinkie is the only other one it might work with.

            @Ginger: I'm kind of imagining a scenario where she uses the initial praise to boost her business and self image. But the conflict would probably come from her getting in over her head as she tries to keep up her image as a hero but has to do more extreme heroic actions to keep it up.

            One of the points of <em>MMDW</em> was to show that Dash is prone to <em>massive</em> ego swelling without even realizing it's happening.  Rarity knows when it is.  Can't see any of the others falling victim to this except maybe Pinkie,  who's in her own happy,  oblivious little world.

            How about this,  when people talk a lot about a certain topic,  they should go to that respective thread. So,  Ginger and his Avatar talk goes to the Avatar thread.

            Way back in the earlier days of the thread there was talk about merging the two threads,  but everybody wanted to stay in the forum they were already in.  The Yack Fest people didn't really want to move to Western Animation.  So since people generally don't want to move to a new sub forum,  swapping the threads wouldn't really serve to switch up where the off topic discussions are happening and would just serve to confuse everyone.
