            I can imagine the alcohol thing being Celestia's best way to elicit information from someone— inviting them to a private meeting,  sharing some wine,  and waiting for them to get drunk before they notice that she's unaffected. Then she just sits back and lets them tell <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas">everything</a></em>.

<p></p>We still don't know where they came from. They could have come from anywhere. That wasn't the POINT of the story. IT wasn't the origin of the princesses,  but of the country. It didn't explain discord,  either.

            it contradicts noting because we didn't know anything for sure to begin with. We don't know what Alicorns really are,  how they came to be,  how besides long life spans they are differentiate from other ponies.
<p></p>Another race? Deities? random mutations? The result of ordinary ponies harnessing three Elements of harmony each? We don't know and so saying X contradicts anything about them is just wrong.

            heh reminds me of one of the several fics named Slice of Life,  this one,  Celestia goes on a diet. apparently Equestria's ponies get a bit upset if their Princess gets to big to move under her own power,  something that was found out after,  as she put it "A century or comfort food following that whole Nightmare Moon incident." Oh and the decade when ponies invented the potato chip.

            Is there any fanfic where it's just the Royal Sisters chilling,  with Celestia getting drunk and making stupid decisions and her continuous pleas to Twilight to find a good hangover cure and Luna getting high and her employees reporting a 100% job satisfaction because Luna's nice enough to share?

            <div class="quoteblock">So,  Celestia is like: I gave you orders that might cause you to endanger a whole civilization,  just to see if you'd violate those orders if it were necessary.
<p></p>and i'm like:So Celestia either has perfect faith in Twilight's ability to unhesitatingly violate orders like that,  or she believed she was giving orders that endangered a whole civilization.
<p></p>throw in that it was initially Spike ignoring Twilight's orders that saved Twilight from the first trap,  and well,  Celestia seems more than a little morally dubious here.
<p></p>If Spike had waited longer:King Sombra wins. If Twilight had hesitated longer:Sombra wins.
</div>
As much as we are constantly reminded of Celestia's Fae-level power,  she lacks their omniscience. She doesn't know everything that's going on in her domain. Otherwise she wouldn't need messengers.
<p></p>I don't think she knew exactly what awaited Twilight in the tower,  nor where the heart was hidden. Her orders were thus: You are going to the Crystal Kingdom as reinforcements. Your mission is to reactivate the shield protecting it. Your friends need to distract the inhabitants and make them happy. In the meantime it is you that needs to find the heart and bring it back. Only you can search,  because I need everyone else on the "propaganda" campaign.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Also:Twilight Sparkle- really really terrifying...she sees a spell once and can just copy it.Yikes.
</div>
I don't think it was duplicating a spell as much as it was channeling nagative emotions into generic "magical burst".
<p></p>Besides,  we don't really know how their magic works. It might be just "channel emotion through horn,  picture what you want to do",  in which case duplicating a spell you've seen is only a question of finding the right emotion(s) and having enough power.
