            Oh yes; the advantage of grappling martial arts is that you get to a LOT of sparring. That's why I am taking judo and wrestling. But of course,  you can see how biased I am for obvious reasons.
<p></p>Regarding TKD,  I will say this as a Korean who practiced it for 6 years and has a black belt.
<p></p>Fuck. That. Shit. So hard.
<p></p>If you really want to learn a strike-based martial art that has kicks,  you are much better off taking muay thai.

            I've actually sort of thought of a pony martial arts league of some sort,  but most of it would be kicks and leg-based grappling.

            See for me,  I'm more in for a martial art that gives me as much and as holistic a workout as possible. I'm a pacifist,  so I don't really care about what the martial art can do. Judo is extremely good exercise - not to mention the fact that you often put <em>everything</em> you have into a grapple makes it a hell of a lot of fun.

            @kegisak - Grappling in general is a hell lot more workout (I am not comparing the effectiveness here) than striking so you are good.

            There is just something so humbling and yet enlightening about getting your ass kicked,  again,  again,  and again. Heh,  during the first month in my wrestling club,  I would always,  <em>always</em>,  get my ass kicked,  even against someone much lighter than me. Nowadays I at least don't (usually) lose against anyone lighter than me. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">

<p></p>Yeah,  I know the feeling. MY class was almost entirely brownbelts or higher when I started,  and some of them were <em>tiny</em>. In fact one of the blackbelts I was probably a foot taller than,  and a hundred pounds heavier than at least... and he pitched me across the room. It was kinda funny,  actually.

            Hey everyone,  what's going on over here?
<p></p>@Martial Arts. I'm a bit proud to know at least the basics of Silat. The few trainers I've had taught me a mix of different styles so it's no one set type. I just use whatever works.

            Keg: At least for the ones that are into stallion on stallion.
<p></p>Breakfalling is a big thing that stuck with me too. More than a decade later I know that I can and will still do them. I'm pretty sure there's more than a few times where I avoided serious injury while snowboarding because of it (and I've heard of enough injuries on the hill during my few year stint that I think it should be a requirement to learn it before starting boarding).
<p></p>I took Hapkido,  which pretty much had the problems d Roy was complaining about for traditional striking martial arts. It was also kind of a jack-of-all trades type martial art,  so while we learning grappling and how to get out of them,  it was 95% drills. We did do sparring,  but it was pretty much a once every six classes type deal. It was my favourite part,  though,  particularly because it broke up the repetitiveness.
<p></p>I can't exactly remember what led up to it,  but I ended up in a match with my third degree black instructor when I was around the orange level. It was pretty much just him completely shutting down my offense and countering the whole time. I do remember being really happy that I managed to sneak one blow (that would have been entirely inconsequential,  but still) in under his guard,  though. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>Back to relating it to ponies,  yes,  definitely think mane and tail grabbing would have to be out as far as organized competitions go,  especially with how full and flowing most of them are.
