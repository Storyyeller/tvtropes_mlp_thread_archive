            And here are my opinions on it:
<p></p>I watched it and liked it pretty much,  although it's not necessarily a big favorite of mine,  either. Rainbow Dash did a great job at showing how she embodies her Element of Loyalty,  though. It also shows an improvement over her behavior from the first episode written by the same writer (Mare-do-well) where this time,  she dropped everything she was doing to rescue ponies falling from a balloon crash. I bet Steve is going to LOVE Spitfire in this story,  since he loves making everything military-related.
<p></p>I thought that it was either ironic or fitting that an episode that featured a running gag of someone being impatient for something to arrive was leaked early,   And on that topic,  I highly identified with Pinkie's constant checking the mailbox.  That's how I get,  only exaggerated,  when I'm impatient for something to arrive or for information to appear on a website.  I also was going to say that earlier in the thread,  storyyeller said something like "What if there was a story where Pinkie had to wait for something?"  This episode answers that question.

            @Seraphem: Honestly,  I don't think it was.  Like Enlong said,  she didn't do anything overtly jerkish until she crashed the rest of the group during the precision flying exercise.  The only jerky thing she did before that was cause RD  to clip her wing,  and that's minor enough that it really isn't that bad.  Sure,  she didn't have much sympathy,  but honestly in the sports world you're kind of expected to be able to power through that kind of thing.  Like how football players will sometimes dislocate a finger,  pop it back into place and get back on the field.
<p></p>She didn't do anything jerkish during the 500 laps or during the recovery exercise,  and she was actually pretty good about not lording her "leader" position of Dash when they ended up being partners.

            @kegi: I truly believe that Rainbow was made wingpony to teach her more teamwork and also to serve as a motivator — so that she would push herself even harder.  I also think it makes sense that the wingpony would be the better flier of the two.  It's similar with sniper teams; the spotter is generally the better sniper of the two since he has to call distance,  corrections,  and so on.

            @Rainbow: Actually on that note, (The military one),  I've already seen the first round of hate for this episode. What it seems to come down to is, 
<p></p>1: Raindbow Dash should have been accepted outright because the Sonic Rainboom.
<p></p>2: Spitfire was out of character,  because she was meaner than she'd been in other episodes.
<p></p>This tells me two things about the haters of the episode,  which are, 
<p></p>1: they do not understand how Team Sports work.
<p></p>2: They do not understand how training,  especially pseudo-military training works.

It's either a really cool flame design,  or a stylized phoenix,  not sure. Either way,  it's pretty badass.
