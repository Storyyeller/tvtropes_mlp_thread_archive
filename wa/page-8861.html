            This may be old news for everyone,  but what was with the complaints on Derpy Hooves? I saw the original clip of her voice and the new voice didnt suit my liking. Whats up with this?

            My view on the songs is more: "Hey,  they're singing a song I've heard before."
<p></p>Though they do tend to sing the lyrics more clearly than the original singers.

<p></p>Enough people believe the word "Derp" to be offensive that Hasbro was forced to edit the scene. She's still know as Derpy to the majority of fans and the people behind the show as well,  though. She'll just never get named on screen again. The voice change was actually correcting an error,  as Tabitha voiced the character as if she was a boy.

            Roger Rabbit was an awesome movie with lots of iconic scenes between famed cartoons (eg. the brilliant piano duel between Daffy and Donald). Be warned though,  just because it has lots of slapstick toons doesn't mean it doesn't have dark points (such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the traumatic manner they first demonstrate the dip...</span>).

It seems like they might have been offended by her 'dur dur' type dialect,  despite a million previous cartoons having it.

            I've got nothing against the show,  but modern covers tend to be more for recognition factor than for the music itself.  My stance on covers like the ones on Glee is basically the same as crowlover's.  And yeah,  I'm kinda frustrated the charts are determined more by "hey,  that's the song from that show" rather than the actual quality of the music,  but given <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">the type of music I like</a> I'm used to my tastes never being in line with the populace at large.

            @Original Yeah,  which is why the voice was changed. They actually had to pitch her voice up in post to make it sound less boyish,  and it was still androgynous.

            The only part of the edit that actually bugs me was that they underped her eyes.  I mean,  that's the whole reason the character was popular to begin with.

            I'm pretty much with Mousa on that one; the changes suck,  but it's nothing worth getting worked up over.
<p></p>@Blue: What I meant was out of the edits as a whole,  the eyes was the only thing that actually bothered me.  I didn't mind excising the name or changing the voice.
