            Oh,  and a couple interesting pony-related things from the con: John Delance was actually there doing autographs and pictures and the like,  and they were selling an original copy of the Friendship Express - the cut before they edited Derpy. I wanted to buy a copy of the DVD and get Delance to sign it,  but they sold the <em>very</em> last copy right before I got to it. I had a sad.
<p></p>I also saw a lot of cosplayers(Some pretty good,  some... not so much. One was pinkamena,  with a Madame <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeFloure" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeFloure">Le Floure</a>!),  including a Fluttershy browsing the Yaoi manga,  which I found humorous.

<p></p>@ Scoots,  don't worry I'm keeping an eye on her,  she does great mane work,  just gets carried away.
<p></p>@ Queen So,  is you shapeshifting actaully altering your physical form,  just a glamour to hide it,  or a combo? I totally won't find a way to use this info agsint you.
<p></p>@ Ginger,  yeah it's good,  but it's not the BEST,  just wait till you get to the season 2 finale.

            It was a lot of Fun,  Chad. You should really consider going if you get the chance. there's a whole ton of vendors just shilling random stuff,  and lots of celebs - sometimes even <em>at</em> the vendor booths. Like the creators of Reboot were at the reboot booth,  and the voice of Jude was at the 6Teen booth. He was a pretty cool guy,  too. I got a few cool-looking comics(Including a print of Lackadaisy Cats!),  and just browsed a few others(Like an Art Book of Wakfu,  but it was in french so I didn't buy it...)
<p></p>The only downside is,  I DID kind of empty my bank account...
<p></p>@Soarin: Nah. I didn't really have anything for him to autograph. Plus I'm always kinda worried about celebrities,  like I don't want to geek out too much and seem off putting or anything. I mean,  you're famous,  you probably get some weird fans now and again. I'm just scared of making it awkward for them,  right?
