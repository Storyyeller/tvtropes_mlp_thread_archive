            My major complaint was Dead Rising 3.
<p></p>Nick seems to be a bit of a coward compared to Frank West and Chuck Greene. And the air strike was just an insult to fans.

            I think the vague everyman angle could be interesting,  so long as he's not perpetually whining. I mean to be fair,  that was a <em>lot</em> of Zombies. But yeah,  the strike was... an odd choice.
<p></p>I think the only game that bothered me was Ryse - the combat looks really choppy and slow and honestly pretty frustrating. I have a hard time believing it'll be any fun... Also I predict the Titans in Titanfall will be pretty useless,  at least in multiplayer. Way to big,  draw too much fire. But that didn't bother me so much because it doesn't look that interesting to me to begin with.

            Dead Rising was awesome because it was A) Timed and B) Silly.
<p></p>Calling in air strikes was just a cock-slap. And the first two games did not have a player character shouting: "OH GOD OH GOD WHY" at a horde. They just put women's underwear on and attached a katana to their faces.

            This not-actually-a-proper-Satyr trend is kind of weird to me.  Why give them horse legs if you otherwise humanise them?  I guess it's kind of cute,  but I'm not sure I get the appeal.

            I don't know. Why have Rarity fighting a giant crab? Fanart rarely makes sense.
<p></p>EDIT: Then again,  I guess the point of Rarity v Giant Crab is that it has no point.

            Ooh,  that's sweet CDRW!
<p></p>As for the games reveal... well,  they were trying to shove in a <em>lot</em> of titles so most of them only got about 30 seconds of screen time,  and you were lucky if it was gameplay instead of just a trailer. All the ones that got more than that were pretty generic shooters,  honestly. So I imagine a lot of the reveals were pretty disappointing for a lot of people,  because it seems like Microsoft is giving so little attention to the games. These were all exclusive,  too,  so if you weren't interested in an Xbox one you probably didn't care. A lot of people were probably wanting Microsoft to confront some of the issues with their system directly... which doesn't look like it's gonna happen. At all.
<p></p>Oh,  also the audio cut out of two seperate games,  one of which was one of the big reveals. Battlefeild was delayed like,  five minutes due to technical difficulties,  leaving the poor spokesman up on stage stuttering vague apologies.
<p></p>IT's not like it was a trainwreck or anything,  it was just disappointing.
