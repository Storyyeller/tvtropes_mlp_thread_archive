            No,  I just disagree with you.  If her physics defying powers ever had plot relevance (outside of Feeling Pinkie Keen),  then yeah,  it would be a problem.

It's the fact that she's the ONLY character who runs on it that bugs me.

            @ Ginger. How to explain...(yes trying to explain my thoughts in words others can understand is is where i really REALLY suck) I dont hold Pinkie to one standard and all the others to another,  I judge each character (not just pony but all) based on that character itself,  and what I judge for most is consistency,  that the ponies (characters is to long to type and I always need to spell check it) actions stay consistent with there previously displayed personality. As long as the ponies actions are consistent with what one either knows or can infer based on setting/story/etc... I can deal with it. Or if not strictly consistent at least done using logic I can understand for WHY they did something inconsistent.
<p></p>The thing is,  most characters all have a good deal of the same base assumptions one can make on there personality based on the setting,  I.E. most ponies could be assumed to have this or that behavioral trait just on the basis of being ponies,  or for being in X genre of story etc... That's where having to use different standards for Pinkie comes in,  all other ponies operate under the narrative rules of MLP:FIM alone,  Pinkie however does not.
<p></p>Now,  I believe the main reason it doesn't really bother me,  is that while Pinkie is not operating under the same base rule set of the rest,  is that she's still operating under a specific pre-made rule set I'm aware of and can understand (mostly) namely Looney Toon's rules.
<p></p>Point I'm trying to convey (probably badly) is that as long as Pinkie consistently operates under a set of rules I can understand the logic behind,  I'm fine with it. And yes I can see how having one and only one pony acting under completely different narrative laws then the rest can be a bit off putting.

            @Seraph Problem is there's no REASON for why I should have to hold her to these seperate standards. She still lives in the same world as the others. We've been given no reason to assume that she's anything special

            good point. From an in universe perspective there really is no explanation or reason. The fact that he other ponies find her odd abilities,  well odd,  makes it clear that it is very very not normal. But HOW she can do so is not,  and really will never,  be addressed.
<p></p>From and outsider perspective we know it's because the writers choose to have her be a looney toon-ish pony as a continuing shout out to the old school legends. Which I do think is another reason a lot of people (including me) like her,  nostalgia for those great toons of old.
<p></p>But yes in verse,  it really does not make sense and can easily seem out of place to people.
<p></p>(personal theory one of Pinkies parents was an actual Toon that popped into Equestria following a mishap involving a painted on train tunnel and a portable hole combo.)
<p></p>EDIT to clarify point: Yes there is not one good in verse reason for her to be different,  and while there is a clear different out of universe reason,  whether or not it's valid is up to each person view on Doyalist versus Watsonian applicability.

            @Ginger: What I mean is that I don't see any reason why her reality warping stuff is problematic when it's only ever used for jokes.  For example,  her teleporting after Rainbow Dash in Griffon The Brush Off; it has no purpose other than for the joke of Pinkie Pie somehow managing to catch up to her.  Because of that,  I don't see it as really being inconsistent with the rules that the show generally follows because they're only broken when it doesn't matter.  If Pinkie displayed that same teleportation ability in a serious scene with plot ramifications I wouldn't like it either.
<p></p>Or we can just chalk this up to different people having different senses of humor and leave it at that.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Same here.  It's fine if someone doesn't like how Pinkie's character works,  but it's been brought up so many times that I'm getting tired of explaining it.

<p></p>or they ARE adressed,  and I'll get annoyed because she's overpowered and outshining the others (Pinkie does NOT have enough likeability for me to forgive her like I can forgive Twilight's overpoweredness)

I really don't think that's the case,  but there are going to be times where you disagree with the rest of the fandom on things.  I fully realize that it sucks to be the only person who holds a particular opinion (I've been in that situation a lot of times),  but it happens.
