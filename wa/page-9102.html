            <span class="blue">@Death Cloud: Well I wasn't really specifically focused on CRISIS in particular,  I just picked it because it seems to be currently held as one of the standards of best fanfic writing.  My intention was to help fanfic writers by showing them the mistakes that are accepted by fanfic readers,  but would probably keep them from getting published (there are exceptions of course,  lots of poorly written stuff does still get published).  Other possibilities would be Fallout Equestria and Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality since I know those are considered very well written.</span>

            one,  do I need to post our song again?
<p></p>two,  will people let up on the fanfics having tiny little errors,  yes we know they are not on par with something that's been through a publisher and editor,  but who cares,  the fanfic writers aren't trying to make money,  it costs you nothing to read it,  they are doing it for FUN,  and so there readers can enjoy the story,  stop trying to criticise them for not being the same quality as a novel that has gone though several rewrites,  at least one of not more editors,  etc... can the writers always improve,  yes. But trying to point out these little things like they are glaring flaws gets old.
<p></p>end of the day only ONE thing matter did you enjoy the STORY,  the story,  not the little tiny details,  but overall was. it. fun. to. read.
<p></p>sorry,  not really just dericted at anyone in particular just something that's been annoying me lately.

            <div class="quoteblock"> two,  will people let up on the fanfics having tiny little errors,  yes we know they are not on par with something that's been through a publisher and editor,  but who cares,  the fanfic writers aren't trying to make money,  it costs you nothing to read it,  they are doing it for FUN,  and so there readers can enjoy the story,  stop trying to criticise them for not being the same quality as a novel that has gone though several rewrites,  at least one of not more editors,  etc... can the writers always improve,  yes. But trying to point out these little things like they are glaring flaws gets old. </div>
<p></p><span class="blue">I'm making the assumption that fanfic writers (at least,  fanfic writers that have long,  epic stories with thousands of readers) probably <em>want</em> to improve,  even if they have no intention of ever publishing anything.  Small mistakes are not a big deal and don't detract much from the enjoyment of reading... but they are also very easy to fix once the writer knows what to look for and how to fix them.  Seeing mistakes briefly jars the reader out of their engagement,  so eliminating all the little mistakes makes for an uninterrupted,  smoother read.  It's not <em>necessary</em> but it does improve quality.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Even though I don't care for fanfiction myself,  I do very much respect those writers who've managed to write stories that can hold so many people's attention.  But I fail to see how wanting to help someone <em>improve</em> at their talent can possibly be offensive.</span>
