            <span class="blue">I consider Rarity more egotistical than Dash because Dash mostly just has pride in her abilities (which are in fact very impressive) and likes other people to notice them.  Rarity,  on the other hand,  just wants to be seen as generally <em>better</em> than everyone in every way,  even when she hasn't done anything in particular to elevate herself.  But like I said before,  she's very much aware of her flaws and does her best to change,  which Rainbow doesn't really seem interested in doing.</span>

            @ginger I think she didn't purposefully try to take it from him. Her instinctual greed was something she just couldn't overcome. However,  I'd argue that a kiss from his idol made a much better gift for Spike than some food. He got that sapphire cupcake as well.

<p></p>How about the haters who watched at least 10 episodes,  or even all of season one out of spite and still don't know what's great about the show {All while insulting the charectors and the fans}? I've seen it happen before.

            I never really interpreted Rarity's actions to have been intentional seduction. Not to mention it wouldn't have made sense in the context of what she did and said in the rest of the episode.
<p></p>Anyway one thing I find kind of weird is that even though I have been able to sympathize with Dash at several points I don't think I could bring myself to fully like her. Anyone else fell that way about other characters?

            I honestly don't see Rarity as being that egotistical at all. She confidant in her skills as a dressmaker,  and in her beauty,  and both are not for no reason. But beyond that she doesn't really have any sort of an 'I'm awesome,  love me" air,  at least not to my mind. She has strong opinions which she sticks to,  and I can see how they might come across as egotism by association,  but compare how she acted when she was first getting invited to high society - she actually seemed <em>shocked</em> that they wanted her. It's obvious she wants to be good enough,  and she was lavishing in being considered so,  but I think on the whole she <em>doesn't</em> think she's reached her dreams yet,  which is refreshing.
<p></p>Now this is in contrast to Dash who clearly thinks she's <em>already</em> good enough to achieve her dreams. She doesn't want to <em>earn</em> her way into the wonderbolts,  she assumes she simply has to show off and they'll accept her. That smacks much more of egotism to me than anything Rarity does.
