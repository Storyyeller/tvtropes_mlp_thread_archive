            Baskets are about thirty pounds,  and I don't know if can rightly say for a cartload. It depends on how high you're willing to stack the baskets,  but it's a lot.

            Hello,  everypony!
<p></p>Since you all seemed to be curious I looked up that "Gelding Grotto" place to see if I could find an origin for the name.  It took a while,  but I eventually located the journal of the explorer who first mapped that area.  As it turns out,  that grotto was home to a fortune teller who gave advice and guidance to travellers.  Apparently he <em>intended</em> to label the place as the "Guiding Grotto",  but his hoofwriting was... bad,  and when the official map of the area was being printed,  one of them misread it.  By the time he caught the mistake the map had already gone through the printer.  Apparently he had a rather juvenile sense of humor and found it quite amusing,  so he didn't make any effort to correct it in future editions.
<p></p>It's honestly kind of a stupid story,  but I guess it's better than the alternative.

            @Crowlover: I sure hope not.  I couldn't find any records pertaining to that,  but the explorer in question had quite a few foals after he retired from field work,  so it doesn't seem he was guided in... that direction.

            @Princess Twilight Sparkle - I had a fortune of meeting one of his descendents. He is currently a professor of history in Canterlot Academy. And he is very sexually active.
<p></p>Why did he feel the need to tell me that,  I have no idea.
