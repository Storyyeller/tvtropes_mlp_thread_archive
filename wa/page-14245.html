            There weren't too many other hooved creatures,  they tended to be humanoid,  a creature from Dungenons and Dragons like the Ice orcs or Mountain Elves,  or something weirdly cute like the furbobs.

            About G1 zebras,  from what I know about Zig-Zag,  she was not in the show but in the toyline.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://mylittlewiki.org/wiki/Zig_Zag">http://mylittlewiki.org/wiki/Zig_Zag<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<p></p>Zeb is rather different from the G1 ponies in the stories set in Dream Valley,  as he usually walks bipedal and wears clothing and uses his hooves like hands.  Unfortunately,  we don't know if there are other zebras like him in the G1 universe,  although he could be related to the characters from My Little Pony Tales since they also tend to be more human-like from what I know about that series.

            The reason why I think ME has the best worldbuilding is because all the elements are organic and interacts with each other in a quite seamless way. It also seldom wastes any interesting plot elements.
<p></p>Okay,  I am done with gushing.
<p></p>In another note,  the Octavia avatar looks better without the outline.

<p></p>Me too. I'm hoping he keeps the current pattern for the next one,  which would mean Sweetie Belle is the next to be a mane character. I guess that rules out The Tempest for being the next ruler. We already know a bit about The Druid,  so it could be her,  but it miht be better to see some of The Madmare first. Seeing as though Scootaloo,  Lyra <em>and</em> The Shaper all have close histories with The Druid,  maybe another fic would be focussed on <em>that</em>.

            Yeah,  your not really going into a JB movie for realism and deep characterization. It can be gritty sure,  but that's not exactly the same thing as realistic. For instance,  Warhammer could hardly be called realistic.

            Yeah,  Bond films aren't necessarily known for their realism,  but they do have a pretty specific style of unrealistic-ness.

            Bond is all about style. If you want realism,  you are better off watching <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneSeries" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneSeries">Bourne movies</a>,  and even that is only realistic in relative terms; it is nearly impossible make entertaining action flicks without liberal application of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense">Artistic License</a>.
<p></p>I personally prefer Bourne over Bond,  even though the latter is infinitely more popular.

<p></p>Eeyup. All five rulers have had their identities confirmed and The Shaper has been confirmed as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Applebloom</span>.

<p></p>I rcently read <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheImmortalGame" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheImmortalGame">The Immortal Game</a>. Really enjoyed it. Of course,  the coolest concept of The Immortal Game (spellblades) would have turned up in canon by now if they actually existed. They're too important. I loved how Celestia's battle with Titan was written though. It ws <em>totally</em>' Celestia. However,  if Rarity and Sweetie Belle's biological father really was abusive and they were therefore adopted,  <em>Celestia wouldn't have kept him in her guard</em>. Just a warning,  while every member of the Mane 6 gets a chance to shine,  most of the begining is the "Rarity is a total badflank show". Seeing as though you had similar issues with Rainbow in Harmony Theory. I still really enjoyed it though. And the stkes are certainly high enough. What ith Titan being so ludicrously powerful compared to everything else.

            What exactly is The Immortal Game about?  I've been putting off reading it for a while,  partly because of the vagueness of the description.  Well,  that and because it's apparently a dark story,  but I figure I can get around that as long as,  say,  the mane six aren't killed off or something.

            The Immortal Game: Before the reign of Discord,  the world was ruled by the alicorns Titan and Terra. Their rule was as  horrible as Discord's would become and they were sealed in an act of trickery by their daughters,  Celestia and Luna as,  considering the fact that an alicorn's power is determined by their age,  they would never have stood a chance in a straight fight without the corrupting power of the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SLiver" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SLiver">S Liver</a> of Darkness (which would later create Nightmare Moon). Now,  The seal has been broken,  Titan and Terra are back and want to rule once again, . Their pawn has also driven the Sliver of Darkness into Twilight. Celestia knows that she has no chance of escaping her parents alive,  so she sets up Luna's escape as her first move in the plan to overthrow her parents once again.
