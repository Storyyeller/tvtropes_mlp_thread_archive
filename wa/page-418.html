            Pinkie seems to be pretty stable most of the time. A bit odd,  sure,  but stable. And we,  at least,  know for a fact what it is that sets her off.
It's a much better idea that they stick with her - if they were to leave her,  especially because they thought she was dangerous,  it would only be a matter of time before she got...violent.

            ^That's true.  I wonder if she would get violent,  though - In "Party of One",  she actually distanced herself from the other five and refused to interact with them again until Dash physically dragged her from Sugarcube Corner to the farm,  and even then she just wanted to leave.  It remains to be seen whether or not Madame Le Fleur would suggest that Pinkamina go take her revenge after another few hours of psychosis,  but I didn't get the feeling that she wanted to hurt her friends.  She just seemed sad and jealous,  in that lonely-kid-watching-a-party-through-a-window way.

            Yeah,  I think everyone's letting <em>that</em> fanfic color their view of Pinkie's insanity.  She never showed any signs of getting violent outside of sitting on Rainbow Dash's head,  and that was only because Dash was physically trying to drag her outside. If anything,  Pinkie would make up some imaginary friends and become a recluse or something.

            Pinkie is Pinkie,  and nothing but Pinkie...
<p></p>Anime references aside,  I don't think she's too crazy. She's just really dependent on her friends,  and her ability to trust them. Remember how she acted when Twilight was trusted with Rarity's and Fluttershy's secrets in that one episode? Am I the only one who sees a connection?

            I think deciding to perform a singing skit for a party for your pet alligator,  then holding an after-party is a bit unhinged to start.
<p></p>Nothing personal,  Pinkie Pie,  I love your wackiness,  but learn some limits.  Not that her friends really handled the situation better,  but I guess they aren't good off-the-hoof thinkers,  and didn't say...well,  Pinkie,  that sounds like a good idea,  but let US hold a party for Gummy!  Then surprised her with some for her.

If Pinkie Pie was more logical,  she wouldn't be nearly as entertaining.  Besides,  she's not <em>totally</em> insane normally,  just eccentric and overenthusiastic.  But yeah,  realistically she should have some limits.  It's just that in this case,  she's more fun without them.

            OK,  I'm going to jump in and defend little Pinkie.
<p></p>Pinkie is no danger to anyone.  The only time she's ever hurt anybody is when she's so overexcited that she fails to notice them (the cartwheeling in A Bird In The Hoof,  and her dancing at the beginning of Party Of One for example.)  And it seems that in this world,  pain like that is just shrugged off.
<p></p>Had her breakdown in <em>Party of One</em> been allowed to continue further,  I think that the worst that would have happened is that she becomes a reclusive weirdo who talks to her new friends all day in her room.  When talking to other ponies,  she would be at best gloomy and miserable,  and at worst,  outright cantankerous.  But not violent.
<p></p>This notion that Pinkie's gonna kill everybody is all thanks to that stupid Cupcakes story.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

She's a little crazy,  but she's not <em>dangerous</em> crazy.  The only reason people see it like that is because of the fanfic.  I get that it's easy to spin the character that way in fanworks,  but in canon,  there's no evidence that she's dangerous in any way.

            I wonder though,  it seems odd that except for Gilda we're never given the implication that the ponies had friends before the pilot,  and it seems like Pinkie would have certainly been friends with others beforehand.
<p></p>And man,  I really don't know of i could watch Party of One again,  cause it taps into a very deep fear of mine and it makes me horribly depressed seeing loneliness of that sort depicted. I wouldn't give voices to inanimate objects,  but I understand all too well why she'd become unhinged.

            Okay,  okay,  Violent was the wrong word,  I'll give you that. But my point was,  Pinkie was really broken up about 'losing' her friends,  and that made her pretty unstable. The hearing voices was probably played up for comedy,  it was more than likely just her various thought processes playing out. But they were still pretty frantic,  and danced around a lot for it to really be called stable thought.
<p></p>And she was getting <em>mad</em>. She wouldn't ever hurt her friends,  I get that,  but i don't think It's a stretch to see her stalking them,  or trying to force them to be her friends. There's the more benign option that she would get so depressed she would beg them to take her back,  and I'm not sure that's any better. I'm pretty sure it would break my heart to see Pinkie outright broken like that.

            @Ginger There's two episodes where she does it.  At the end of episode 2,  where she says "Are you excited?  I don't think I've ever been this excited before,  except for that one time I went GASP!..." to the audience.  Then in Over a Barrel,  when Twilight makes the comment about sharing and caring,  Pinkie pops up and says "Hey,  that's what I said!"
<p></p>I've never read Cupcakes and I don't ever plan to,  so I can say my opinion isn't coloured by it.  However,  I could see Pinkie getting a little bit violent.  And no,  I don't imply murderous,  just enough that she could end up getting confrontational and potentionally into the pony equivalent of a shoving match (that likely wouldn't escalate in the end,  mind).  I can honestly say I can really relate to Pinkie here.  The first time I saw this episode,  it was right after I had just spent 3 months planning an event only to have everyone no show.  I could really see her hurt and yea,  while it's pretty scatterbrained to forget one's own birthday,  I'll freely admit I could feel my eyes watering a bit.  I just wanted to reach through the screen and comfort her.
<p></p>Edit: Oh,  forgot to add: did anyone else have a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> moment when AJ smashed Pinkie's head with that barn door?  Yes,  Pinkie was being pushy,  but that was completely uncalled for.

            ^Yeah,  that was a little rough.  Though I have to say,  it was probably the only thing that would've stopped Pinkie <em>or</em> Pinkamina from going in and seeing what was happening - and she doesn't even seem annoyed about it,  just that she couldn't get into the barn.
<p></p>But yeah.  Pinkamina does unnerve me a little,  but I mostly just feel sorry for her.  I'd want to hug her if she wouldn't just flank-check me into a wall and go home.  I can see where you're coming from,  kegisak,  in terms of her getting violent,  but remember that she pretty much acted like she never wanted to see any of them again when Dash dragged her to the barn.  I don't think it's YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME so much as 'Those guys were really mean to me and they're all jerks and I don't even <em>want</em> to be friends with them anymore'.  Sour grapes,  as it were.
