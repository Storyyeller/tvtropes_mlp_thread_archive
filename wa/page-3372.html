            You know,  the absolute <em>worst</em> we see of Rarity's fear of dirt is in her own friends' <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a> of how she is dealing with being captured by the Diamond Dogs. So,  yeah,  even her friends <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderize" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderize">Flanderize</a> her into a pathetic narcissistic lump in their minds when she obviously isn't that bad. Otherwise she just tries to avoid getting dirty if she doesn't have to,  and hell,  I avoid getting mud on myself as much as possible in real life too. Add to that the fact that she was willing to get dirty for her sister,  and all of her other flaws that she actively fights against,  and you have what is probably the deepest character out of the mane six (IMO).
<p></p>Actually,  that mini-rant has pretty much made me pick her as my favorite,  even though I don't usually rank characters like that. She just gets the best character moments.

            I think that might have been to get anybody who had either started watching just that season or hadn't been involved with the MLP fandom in between seasons 1 & 2 a quick glimpse at what her personality was like.
<p></p>Matter of fact,  the whole intro of Return to Harmony Part 1 seemed like a personality recap for everyone.
<p></p>@Red,  Mousa: You're viewing both separately. She didn't want to go out from under her umbrella at first due to her tendencies,  but then noted that Twilight needed it more than she did.
<p></p>And seriously,  Red,  you're starting to flare up. I can tell. Calm down.

<p></p>I agree,  but what bugs me is she always goes and falls back into the same exact failures later on.  Yet I haven't started hating her yet so I guess it's not too big of a problem.

I have the same problem myself. Falling back to the same failures,  I mean,  not being a princess prissy-pants.

            I suppose it in the end depend on the sort of person each of us is. I cannot stand inflated egos and self-absorbed types which puts me instantly at odds with Rainbow and Rarity and their worse moments are only going to validate my feelings more than their good moments are going to convince me they're likable.

It's not like she makes the exact same mistake over and over again,  either. She just has flaws that aren't instantly resolved with a single realization.

            I love inflated egos and large hams,  so long as I feel the person underneath is good enough to back it up.  They're entertaining.

            In my case,  I can forgive Rarity because she often has these moments where she <em>catches herself</em> in a fault. Being conscious of her own failings is something I admire about her.
<p></p>Rainbow Dash,  on the other hand,  can just be plain insensitive,  so she's one of my least liked characters. Not that she doesn't also have her good points too. I don't particularly <em>dislike</em> her either,  but... I guess I just sort of tolerate.

            Note that the falling back on old habits makes a lot of sense realistically,  even if it's a little handwavy for the Reset button in show terms.  They're <em>habits</em>,  after all,  and all of the girls have been living their lives in their own ways for years before Twilight arrived and drew them all together.  I know for a fact that people don't just up and change forever after one incident,  no matter how well-worded the moral soundbite is.  It takes time to change,  and we're seeing the girls become better people slowly but surely.

            I think my opinion on ego comes down to how they treat <em>other</em> people. I'm fine with RD going around talking about how amazing she is - she's got a right to,  even if she has a long way to go - but she can at least admit when someone <em>else</em> is good. I know people who claim that their the best,  and anyone else is irrelevant,  and they like to rub how good they are in peoples<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> read: my</span> faces. Those people bother me. But RD and Rarity both at least have a shred of humility and compassion,  so I can accept that.
