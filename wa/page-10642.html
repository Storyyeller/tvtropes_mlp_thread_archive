            Yeah,  I'm basically with Psi on that one.  It isn't just that it focused on side characters,  it's that it focused on characters that we're probably not going to ever see again,  and that I didn't really find that interesting.  As far as single-episode characters go,  I think the ones in that episode were some of my least favorites. I found the mane cast <em>way</em> more interesting than the Apploosans or the Buffalo,  so the whole time I was basically thinking "I don't care about Thunderhooves!  Let the mane cast do something!"  But my main issue is that the resolution basically happens just because of an accident.   I dunno,  I just didn't enjoy it.  Oh,  and I'm also bothered by the fact that I don't think the conflict is as even-sided as the episode tries to make it out,  but I'm not going to start that argument again.
<p></p>@Mousa: That's <em>glorious</em>.

            While I do not like Rarity I will respect her particular brand of guile,  it take s a special person to be annoying in that specific method,  most characters that attempt to annoy their way out of a situation come off as obnoxious to their captors and only get themselves roughhoused for their troubles,  Rarity actually managed to be legitimately annoying.
<p></p>Also,  I cannot sit through that scene with my eardrums intact. Or my sanity.
<p></p>And thank you Dreni and Applelight.

            That is indeed really good,  Mousa,  though I question the logic of the Diamond Dogs using a harness to attach Rarity to the cart to haul it if she's human.

            Because reasons. It's similar to the mechanism I designed for a humanized railroad pony. Perhaps the Diamond Dogs's tech is primitive or something. Besides,  it would keep her trapped,  wouldn't it?

            I still maintain that the Buffalo needed that migratory route because detouring took them away from the only readily available source of water in the area for too long,  but whatever. We've been over this way too many times,  and no one is going to change their minds.

            Yes. But a story that parallels something needs to be able to stand on its own as well as stand on historical ground. The story can't stand on its own in the same way.

            @Van: 2 things.
<p></p>1. I don't think there's any substantial correlation between Real Life and the events of the episode; I think the writers just wanted to use the western aesthetic and used the conflict as an excuse.  I totally agree with you in regard to the real life conflict,  but that's not what's happening in the show.  If you take away the "cowboys and Indians" trappings and just look at the two groups with no reference for real life,  it changes the situation.
<p></p>2. In the episode,  the settlers have just as much claim to the land as anyone else because as far as we know,  the land was completely unsettled and there was zero indication that the buffalo owned it.  What happened is the settlers found a piece of land that no one was using,  settled it,  and were apparently around long enough to build a fully functioning town without any interference before the buffalo showed up.
<p></p>@Perpetual: I'd find that more compelling if the Buffalo had ever actually <em>said</em> that.  Their entire argument consists solely of "this is where we usually stampede" with absolutely no other reasons.  If it had been grazing grounds or something I'd understand it,  but with the info we have I don't see how they're inconvenienced by anything other than having to go around the orchard rather than through it.
