Too much fanon is always brought in on these discussions to cover the fact that canon really isn't as all-encompassing as all that,  because it was never designed to have legitimate power levels. I think,  if we really must,  then we should limit it to the 'saga' arc(Season 1 opener and season 2 and 3 opener and closer),  since that's the only place where combative power,  and power in general,  is taken into serious account. Which means basically the only things we KNOW about power are that Fluttershy resists corruption,  Twilight is exponentially powerful magic-wise,  Dash can pull off a Rainboom effectively at will,  and all six of them can hold their own in a brawl. </div>
<p></p>Eh,  there are other episodes which bring out direct comparisons.

            @Sereg: Well,  maybe,  but they're few and far between,  at any rate. You could definitely lump Magic Duel,  and maybe even Boast Busters in there,  but I think the point still remains.
