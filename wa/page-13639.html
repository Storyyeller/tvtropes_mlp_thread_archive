            I don't have time at the moment to rank all the episodes,  but for me at least the top episode is either "Magic Duel" or "Wonderbolt Academy" and the bottom one is "Apple Family Reunion".  "Magical Mystery Cure" is basically smack dab in the middle.

            I thought of something about Discord.  I wonder if he was in Ponyville when Twilight messed up the cutie marks,  and what he thought of that.  I bet he thought it was hilarious,  especially considering who was responsible for the mess-up and may have been disappointed when Twilight helped her friends rediscover their talents and fixed her mistake.
<p></p>@Mio: Sorry,  it was just what I thought of with that scene,  since both things involve eating Rainbow Dash,  and in both cases,  it's someone who isn't normally carnivorous doing it (or at least someone who wouldn't normally eat ponies).  I don't think that they actually would have shown anything gory on the show or that Cupcakes is canon at all.
<p></p>About the earlier conversation about Fluttershy in the comics,  I would also note that while Fluttershy and Applejack regularly work with animals,  Fluttershy lets them live on their own terms while Applejack's farming is all about controlling and corralling animals for whatever they need from them (like milk from the cows).  So Fluttershy is probably more used to just letting nature take its course and is also the one who befriends otherwise scary/menacing creatures anyway,  such as the manticore in the pilot or Discord.  Fluttershy being more comfortable with nature's more "wild" aspects also makes sense if you think that she lives the closest to the Everfree Forest of all the main characters,  where things aren't regulated by ponies.  This is probably why Applejack in particular is so creeped out by it,  since farming would be the opposite of just letting plants and animals go wherever they want,  since farming involves purposely planting seeds and making specific plots and places for plants to grow.
<p></p>That could be an interesting conflict for a Fluttershy/Applejack episode,  actually.  Fluttershy is used to letting animals run wild and only exerting control when they need her to,  while Applejack is used to doing things like herding and corralling them and often ignoring it when they are able to speak for themselves (like in the gag with the sheep in Sisterhooves Social).  This was shown in Applebuck Season where Applejack's way of dealing with the bunny census was to forcefully corral them,  although it was also implied that she may not normally have been so rough with them if she wasn't so sleep-deprived and stressed.

            Top three?
<p></p>1. Sleepless in Ponyville <br>2. Wonderbolt Academy <br>3. One Bad Apple
<p></p>Least favourite would probably be... I dunno,  after those they're all kinda blase to me... excluding the opening and finale as usual,  of course,  and Keep Calm and Flutter On is a definitive 4 I suppose. But I'd say my least favourite is actually probably Magic Duel,  largely due to a sort of after-the-fact <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a>. On their own merits probably Apple Family Reunion or Too Many Pinkie Pies. Although the latter is probably one I'd like more in retrospect.
