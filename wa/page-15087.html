            That's nice their self-aware about it.
<p></p>Reminds me a bit of Kingdom of Loathing. Servers crash and lose a few days of data? No,  it's the start of an epic time travel quest they then implemented into the game.

            @Dark: Thanks. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>I'll start with issue one (spoilered,  just in case somebody here hasn't read it yet. Also note that I'm doing this from memory,  so I might forget something.  Also note it's not a transcript or anything. I don't have time to do that.
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The first issue opens with the CMC going out in the middle of the night to crusade at Fluttershy's cottage,  attempting to get zoologist cutie marks. Or jungle adventurers,  even though Fluttershy's backyard isn't really a jungle.  Sweetie Belle (Being a dictionary and all) notes that the study of ponies is called "hippology" even though they don't look like hippos. Naturally,  a hippo is there,  and Scootaloo puts Apple Bloom's bow on its head.  They decide to maximize their chances of getting their cutie marks by splitting up to work with the animals,  doing things like teaching a bear to ride a scooter while wearing a tutu and a tiny hat.  Then the animals start acting strangely.  Their eyes begin to glow,  and they pounce on the CMC.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The scene jumps to the next day,  showing a typical day in Ponyville. It's a tableau with a billion background events that I can't really list here.  Suffice to say,  there's Derpy,  Roid Rage,  Firefly,  Screwball,  and Cranky,  amidst other references.  A few of the ponies are acting strangely.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Inside,  Applejack asks her sister how the previous night's crusading went,  but Apple Bloom isn't really responsive. Applejack isn't sure what to make of it. Likewise,  Rarity notices that Sweetie Belle is acting a bit too stoic.  Then Rarity is distracted by a hat that needs more feathers. Meanwhile,  Rainbow Dash is bothered by the fact that Scootaloo doesn't want to hang out with her.  The mane six gather near the library,  noticing that a lot of ponies around town are acting very strange,  ambling around with blank eyes and basically acting oblivious.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Twilight mentions that she was trying to set up a viewing for the coming Secretariat Comet,  and Fluttershy says that Cheerilee didn't show up at the school.  Pinkie says that the Cakes didn't open up Sugarcube Corner.  The other ponies continue to act weird,  and begin to gather around the mane cast,  who retreat into the library.  The rest of the ponies chase them and try to bust into the library.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Twilight,  remembering the events of "A Canterlot Wedding",  realizes that changelings might be involved. She checks her notes and confirms that changelings are doing something in Ponyville.  She attempts to write a letter to Princess Celestia (After three rewrites and a spell check),  but gets back a canned form-letter response.   Rainbow Dash and Applejack want to bust out and try to solve the problem,  but they don't know how to get past the mob in front of the library.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Pinkie suggests blending in,  basically having the whole cast act like zombies to sneak through the other ponies. She suggests smiling,  but it's really creepy and she decides against it.  The ruse works,  and they manage to make it out of Ponyville into a nearby forest.  In the forest,  they see two changelings.  The changelings have captured Derpy in a chrysalis by luring her into a trap with a trail of muffins.  One of the changelings takes on Derpy's appearance,  but the eyes are straight,  so the other changeling bonks him to get the eyes derped.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The changelings notice the mane 6,  but the fake-zombie thing works and the changelings fly off.   The mane six realize that the changelings have been trapping ponies and taking their place,  and discover that all the ponies are imprisoned in the Town Hall.  They bust in to free all the ponies,  but the changelings attack,  all turning into Pinkie Pie.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> A battle ensues.  RD and Applejack go right to work,  kicking changeling butt.  Fluttershy is hesitant to fight until a changeling bonks RD upside the head,  at which point Fluttershy releases the beast.  In order to make sure they can tell the difference between the changelings and the real Pinkies,  Rarity styles Pinkie's hair to look like her own.  She then begins to take out changelings with magic blasts,  pretending that they're bad fashion decisions (leg warmers and stirrup pants). The changelings begin to overwhelm the ponies,  but Pinkie pulls out the party cannon,  taking out the rest of the changelings by blasting them with a wave of frosting.  Rarity notes that events escalated quickly,  and ended abruptly.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The cast  frees the rest of the ponies,  but Scootaloo,  Sweetie Belle,  and Apple Bloom are nowhere to be found.  Pinkie re-inflates her mane.  Rarity is not pleased. Meanwhile,  Spike starts to cough,  and eventually horks up a crystal ball.  Twilight thinks it might be from the Princess,  but then the ball glows green,  and Chrysalis' face appears,  naturally with an evil laugh.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Chrysalis reveals that she's kidnapped the CMC.  At first,  Rarity is skeptical that they're the real deal,  but then they begin to argue about getting a kidnapping victim cutie mark. They're definitely real. Chrysalis tells the cast that they have to come to the changeling kingdom to recover them (and also because she's already getting sick of their chatter).  She begins to monologue,  but Scootaloo gasps that she's about to reveal her entire plan,  causing her to cut it off. She gives them a three-day ultimatum,  and cuts off the communication.  The crystal ball then displays a map to the Changeling kingdom.</span>
<p></p><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Twilight realizes that Chrysalis' plan coincides with the coming of the Secretariat comet,  which has all sorts of weird magical effects. She thinks that's why Celestia is unavailable.  The ponies realize that Chrysalis is probably setting up a trap,  but RD,  Rarity,  and AJ refuse to sit by while the CMC are in danger,  so the cast leaves Spike in charge of the captured changelings and to try and contact Celestia,  and head out. They walk into the sunset as Pinkie expresses her desire to see monkey ninjas.</span>
<p></p>Holy crap that was long.
