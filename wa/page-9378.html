            It's always disheartening when the tropes page for a work gushes about the main character. It also turns me off REALLY fast XD

            How does A Friend in Deed make Pinkie look better? Because it shows just how much effort she puts into making others happy. It impressed me. And I was glad that the show acknowledged her annoyingness rather than let her get away with it as it used to. I used to be really irritated that Pinkie was annoying to me,  but the other characters let her get away with it. I didn't see her as <em>any</em> more annoying in A Friend in Deed than she <em>usually</em> was in season 1.

            I have to agree,  <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFiD" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFiD">A Fi D</a> had Pinkie at some of her most obnoxious and oblivious behaviour in the entire show.  Not only did she fail to respect Cranky's privacy and personal space,  she broke some of his shit.  Granted,  she did try to correct her mistakes,  but like I said most of the episode she's blithely oblivious to Cranky's desires.  I'm not saying she was entirely wrong in the episode,  it just would've been nice if she had respected him a bit more.

            Sorry,  but I believe the exact opposite. Pinkie's bad behaviour there was <em>exactly what I had come to expect from her</em> and was glad that she finally started trying to make things right.

            To be honest,  A Friend in Deed is the only time where I actually found Pinkie annoying {Though not as much as other people do},  though I can understand how someone would find her annoying in "The last roundup" and maybe even "Luna eclisped". Otherwise,  I really don't understand the massive hate that Pinkie Pie get's.-_-

            What personally annoyed me the most about Friend Indeed was that ultimately Pinkie did not learn anything,  or at least didn't demonstrate that she did.

            Eh,  guess this is another thing me and Sereg won't see I-2-I on.  Personally I didn't think they "let her get away with annoyingness" in Season 1,  but in Season 2 they effing let her break-and-enter and stash stuff all over Ponyville.

<p></p>@ Sereg: In series 1 Pinkie didn't break into someone's house who didn't want anything to do with her and then trash the place. She may not have intended to trash the place,  but she did. And ponies did find her annoying in series 1. Twilight,  Rainbow and Fluttershy in Griffon the Brush Off for example.

            I <em>didn't</em>find Pinkie annoying in any of those three episodes because the characters <em>acknowledged it</em>. In season 1,  I'd be grating my teeth and wondering why she got away with <em>everything</em>. As I said,  I am often on Ginger's side when it comes to Pinkie (though I'm less extreme).

            <div class="quoteblock">I'll never be able to love Pinkie because,  on a fundemental level,  she doesn't feel human enough to be relateable most of the time. Most of the time she feels like a cartoon. </div>
<p></p>I didn't feel this way at first,  but its becoming more and more prominent.  She's basically a Looney Tune character in Ponyville now and just doesn't mesh with the setting anymore.
<p></p>I mean yeah,  FIM is at least part-comedy,  but its also got its serious moments and I'd like someone,  somewhere,  to respect that and rein Pinkie in when the situation calls for it.  There are times where her being completely whacko is <em>not</em> welcome.  I call,  again,  to the difference between "Pinkie's reaction to Hydra" and "Pinkie's reaction to Cerebus."  The former is the right way,  the latter is el wrongo.

            Yeah, I don't see stashing stuff as annoying at all.
<p></p>Griffon the Brush Off was an episode that had Pinkie impress me,  partially for that reason,  but it then started the trend of "Pinkie is always right" which lasted <em>ages</em> and really annoyed me. I <em>like</em> <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLanders" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLanders">Cloud Cuckoo Landers</a>,  but not if they're portrayed as being superior to normal people.
<p></p>That's why Luna Lovegood is my favourite Harry Potter character and Pinkie annoyed me for so long,  because Luna <em>didn't</em> get away with things. She was a woobie.
<p></p>EDIT: Again,  I consider Pinkie to be <em>far</em> more realatable now than she used to be. She's actually used in serious situations and doesn't display hypercompetance for no reason. It's why she's grown on me so much.

            Stashing stuff all over is bad because it breaks Willing Suspension of Disbelief.  I have to assume A) she can afford this stuff B) every other pony (and other creatures—like if there were squirrels living in that tree or something) would be fine with the stuff and not bother it in any way,  C) that stuff like,  say,  eyepatches would still be sanitary after being hidden in a fireplace (poor Twi must be getting soot in her eye...) and D)... my mind locked up.  Point is,  its just dumb,  and only works on the idea that "its okay because its a gag, " which is BAD THINKING.

            I'd much ather have her stashing stuff than the kind of stuff she used to pull off. Especially as the stuff sheused to pull off affected ponies in ways that resulted in others treating her unrealistically.
