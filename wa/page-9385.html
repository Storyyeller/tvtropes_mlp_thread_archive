            @ Kegi: When has she planned to crash a Wonderbolts performance in Series 2 out of curiosity?
<p></p>And yet they were impressed enough for her to win. If they were that impressed by her failure how impressed would they be by her success?

            I think they should do an epsisode where Rainbow Dash goes to get her flightschool GED.
<p></p>Her friends (or at least Twilight) try to help her study for it,  but it just makes her test anxiety worse.  I could see Twilight trying to discuss weather theory with her or something... and just totally confusing her.
<p></p>In the end she goes to take the test,  maybe with the same anxiety that she had in the Cloudsdale flying competition,  but when she actually sits down and starts taking it,  it's really not all that bad.  She knows all of this stuff because she works int he field and trains hard!  She passes the test with flying colors (bad pun) and maybe a graduation party at the end of the episode.

            @Blue: there is. If she's training it's to be good enough. She could train and go through their <em>actual</em> avenues of recruitment. But she's <em>just</em> trying to impress them. Not to be fair and compete against the other applicants,  but to undercut the whole route and get instantly accepted through being flashy.
<p></p>@Bad: Not crash necessarily,  but she still retains the same mindset: Impress them! Wonderbolt captain is coming out to the water-whatsit? Shit,  we'd better break the record to impress them!
<p></p>Like I said,  she <em>has</em> evened out a bit,  but her mind is still set squarely on impressing them,  whereas Rarity has switched to a tactic that will <em>earn</em> her what she wants,  fairly. Focus on her fashion and take the opportunities as they arise - and before you say that's what Dash is doing,  it's a different situation. Rarity's is the on;y way to acheive what she wants,  but Dash may well be circumventing the intended method. Which,  it is interesting to note,  may be why she <em>hasn't</em> come close to attaining her goal like Rarity has.

            Yeah,  I think that RD is skilled enough to do it,  but she has a lot of kinks to work out first.  In the sense of,  if she continues training she'll eventually be skilled enough to do it.  I feel compelled to point out that even if the Sonic Rainboom is epic,  it's also pretty much her one big move.  Not only does she need other Wonderbolt-caliber tricks to use,  she needs to be able to complement <em>their</em> signature moves as well.
<p></p>@Kegisak: Except that we've never seen what the <em>official</em> route is,  or what it entails,  and again,  the two options aren't mutually exclusive.  For all we know Dash fully intends on doing a legit tryout and figures there's no harm in trying to impress the judges in the meantime.

            @Bluespade: Exactly; we don't know what the  official process is,  so we can't really say that RD is trying to subvert it in any fashion.

            Not to mention that it's only good sense to go through more than just the standard application process. A good many of those sorts of groups want to stick with people they know and already have a handle on. That's why "networking" is a thing.

            This is admittedly fair. I'm making the assumption because it's the logical one to make,  for various reasons,  but it <em>is</em> an assumption. Nevertheless,  if they <em>don't</em> have an official route of application,  doesn't that just show more egotism on Dash;'s part for assuming she's good enough to be accepted into a team that isn't looking for new members?

Rarity's is the on;y way to acheive what she wants,  but Dash may well be circumventing the intended method.

            @ Kegi: Break the record for Ponyville actually. Not for herself. And when they showed up during Secret of My Excess she jumped into action to join them right?
<p></p>She is focussing on opportunities that arise,  she's asked to make a tornado,  she focusses on making a tornado,  she's asked to do a vertical sonic rainboom,  she focusses on making a Sonic Rainboom.
<p></p>So instead of training to do a vertical Sonic Rainboom (improving her flying),  training the town (leadership) and make a group tornado (teamwork). All things that could help her during an audition to be a Wonderbolt she should,  what sit back and relax until there's an audition? You don't think others train to be as good as possible before taking an audition?
