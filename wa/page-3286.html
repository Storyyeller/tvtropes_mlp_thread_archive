            Actually,  it looks like one of them has an apple missing a single slice,  and the other has that slice.

            I was a little afraid this was going to have "technology is EVIL" implications,  but it luckily was more about "quality over quantity, " so I'm satisfied and liked this episode.  I also like that it shows that Applejack was able to remember the lesson she learned in Applebuck Season and accept help from her friends.
<p></p>By the way,  the Flim Flam brothers reminded me a bit of the Weasley twins from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a>,  mainly because they have red manes (with white stripes) and the fact that the Weasley twins do have some con artist tendencies.

            Honestly,  judging by Granny Smith's expression when she tasted their cider during the song,  it might actually have tasted pretty good. But then they decided in the end that they would sacrifice quality control and make an inferior product just for the sake of making a buck,  and that screwed them over. Who would trust them after that?
<p></p>Edit: Well Ginger,  more people on an assembly line usually means faster work. And it's not like the Apples weren't doing anything.

            @Ginger: That's more an issue of good teamwork than sheer numbers. Their numbers doubled,  and they all work well together,  so production went up accordingly. Because keep in mind,  not only did the family now have somepony helping them in each of their jobs,  they also had a pony to cover the extra jobs,  keeping them from having to do double shifts. It makes sense to me,  it's a reasonable progression.
<p></p>@Robbie: But she knew all that shit all along. She was <em>right</em>,  just as she said. She didn't learn it,  she just had it proved.

            @Robbie: Basically,  she knew from the beginning that quality was more important than quantity,  and that she could count on her friends.  She didn't learn either of those lessons; all that happened was that what she already knew was validated.

            @Ginger:  It means that Apple Bloom and Granny Smith obviously aren't going to be as quick as the mane cast due to their age.  Applejack and Big Mac were doing most of the work,  so five new able bodied ponies are obviously going to significantly increase their production.

            @Ginger: It means that AJ can work the cider production fast enough that it takes <em>all five of the rest of the Mane Six</em> to work faster than her. Everypony has their strengths,  and AJ is clearly the master appleworker.
