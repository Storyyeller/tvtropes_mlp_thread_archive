            Maybe Moonlit Blood is a forensics investigator and a night owl? Or a detective?
<p></p>Came up with some ways to make my 'real name' pony names a bit more bearable.
<p></p>Glimmer Wing: A light technician at the weather factory. Got into his job because he loves the sunrise and how it glimmered off the early dew. Loves flying through clouds and gathering dew on his wings,  making them seem to sparkle in the light.
<p></p>Midnight Spice: An apothecary with a deep Blue coat,  accented by a red mane. He's a bit cool and distant,  on account of often venturing into the darker reaches of the everfree for his herbs. His dark coat allows him to blend in,  and this coupled with his silent demeanor means he often sneaks up on people without meaning too. His succinct language covers and warm heart; he found his passion after patching up a foal's scraped knee and loves to see ponies getting better. Alternatively,  a brewer with a knack for... entertaining drinks.
<p></p>Shining Stones: An artificer who specialized in working with jewels. Be it for jewelry,  art,  or decoration for a piece of armour or weaponry,  if it's got jewels in it he can make it. He's also been known to dabble in enchanting his gems from time to time.
<p></p>There. Much better. Shining Stones still sounds like some sort of bdsm thing,  though...

            As a Unicorn Colt I got the name Noble Blood,  which is pretty badass.
<p></p>As a scholarly sort (read: nerd) I felt I should pick Unicorn,  though I'd prefer to be a Pegasus given the choice.  What could be better than flying?
<p></p>So today my little brother officially became a U.S. Marine,  assuming he passed The Crucible.  I'm flying out next Wednesday to see him graduate.

Why should I have to deal with these ponies when all I want is a simple letter!? If only there were a way for the mail to come to me directly,  and not have to go through some government worker!

If this works,  think of what we could use this for! Why,  we could be sending packages overseas in instants! We could ship <em>whole ponies</em>! Maybe a few at once! And that's just the beginning!

            Y'know,  I wonder how Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo met. They don't seem like the types to become friends. I don't remember how it was worded in Call of the Cutie,  but weren't the two of them friends BEFORE Diamond Tiara's Cute Ceanera?
<p></p>It probably had something to do with the fact that they were both blank flanks.

            It was never said if they'd met before,  but they were introduced together,  so it's sort of assumed.  I think if Scoots was a dash fan before she might have met Sweetie Belle through her. But the more likely situation is they were both sulking at the party,  and they just sort of noticed each other.
<p></p>I wonder how the school system in ponyville works? There only seems to be one teacher and one schoolhouse,  which holds... what,  9 students at a time? Maybe she just holds hour long sessions for a group of students,  then they leave and the next group comes in? Like how a college professor only teaches courses,  they're not dedicated to classes like elementary school teachers are. Kind of shoots their education in the foot,  but it's reasonable that they'd expect a pony to pursue the field that interests them on their own time. School is just for the basic,  daily life stuff.

            Well,  they all go to the same school,  none of them have gotten their cutie marks when most of the other students have,  2 of them are related to the Mane 6 with Scootaloo being a big fan of Rainbow.  It'd be really unlikely that they <em>wouldn't</em> meet each other.

We also saw the entire school at recess in cutie pox and there were a might few more than 9 kids in that playground. Do the kids who don't currently have a class just continue to play outside until the class that came before theirs finishes?

            I think they may be free to do whatever they like. I took the change of class roster to be basically that they'd taken a break and returned from the summer.
<p></p>I imagine the kids are free to do whatever they like when they don't have classes,  but they built a playground near the school to keep them all nearby,  and so they could keep an eye on them while their parents are at work.
