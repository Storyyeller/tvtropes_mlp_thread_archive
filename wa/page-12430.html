            Yeah,  this is definitely up there.  I don't know if I'd put in my absolute top tier episodes (Season 2 premiere,  Hurricane Fluttershy,  etc.),  but it's certainly at the same level of Luna Eclipsed or Sweet and Elite.

            Some like Sonic Rainboom largely for being the one 'episode concerning RD's flaws' that didn't involve her acting like a Jerkass to some degree. I think that's similar reason for Hurricane Fluttershy.
<p></p>I also agree with the previous comment,  I like they managed to make notable scenes for all the mane six in this episode,  compared to some previous ensemble episodes,  where two or three are clearly stealing the spotlight or just standing there as dead weight.

            Out of curiosity would this episode count in the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamRocketWins" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamRocketWins">Team Rocket Wins</a> territory? Trixie lost in the end,  but she did beat Twilight at first along with outright <em>taking over Ponyville</em> and got a somewhat happy ending.

            <div class="quoteblock">Sonic Rainboom is generally well received,  although I think it's far from the series best episode. I actually think this one is overall a bit better than SR; Fluttershy was a bit exaggerated,  but she wasn't nearly as bad as Rarity was in Sonic Rainboom. </div>
<p></p>I think it also suffers from being the most predictable episode in the entire series.

            I mean I know that it was just because the town hall needed to be rebuilt,  but I still think it's funny to immagine her as money obsessed. Sort of like Applejacks' barn obsession or Sombra's stair obsession.

            As mentioned in the Cheesy Cartoons thread,  sometimes predictable plots aren't bad at all. In fact sometimes it works better than trying to twist things around. It's how you execute it. A fair lot of FIM's episodes are based on recurring cartoon plots.
