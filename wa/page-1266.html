            Well,  it's clear to some degree she wasn't herself. Perhaps its simply a case of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreaTPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreaTPowerComesGreatInsanity">With Grea T Power Comes Great Insanity</a>? With all that power she thought she could just push and push,  take what she wanted for just a little while. Then when Celestia had to banish her,  she felt wronged,  because she only wanted a little respect and she was banished for 1000 years. So by the time she came back she really <em>was</em> evil,  and Twi and the Mane 6 just knocked her down to size,  and gave her a little bit of a timeout to think about it. Or maybe she took it from a nasty source that kept whispering in her ear,  egging her on to make some really bad decisions and clouded her mind so she couldn't really understand what she was doing until she was free.
<p></p>Personally,  I'm trying to forgo theories; I just want to see a flashback episode of the whole thing. It's highly unlikely to happen unless something <em>did</em> corrupt Luna,  in which case it's likely to be a season finale thing,  but still. It would be nice to not have the different sections of the fanbase sniping at each other over their various fanons,  completely regardless of the fact that they all have the <em>exact smae amount of merit</em>,  since they're all fanon.

            Yeah,  that's true. I can genuinely imagine the whole nightmare Moon incident as a fight that just got waaaaaaaaaaaay out of hand. These are two immensely powerful ponies,  if not <em>goddesses</em>,  who live for likely thousands of years. We have no idea how long they've been around before all this - since the dawn of time? The birth of the planet? The birth of ponykind? We have no sense of scale,  here.

<p></p>^A fair point.  We didn't really get any new information on the topic from "Luna,  Eclipsed",  so there's no real point in rehashing the same debates.

            I feel I should point out,  did Luna ever even <em>consider</em> the ultimate cost of her actions? She didn't want the ponies to die - that's the opposite of what she wanted. As soon as she saw them suffering,  if she was in her right mind at least,  she would have stopped. All she wanted was a little bit of love. The exact same thing she wanted in Luna Eclipsed,  in fact.
