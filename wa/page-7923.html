            @Lurker: It's not they are quite on the decline (though as said before,  AJ has been underplayed outside another "AJ being stubborn" story with The Last Roundup) it's just on that very difficult balance where it could tip to one side at any point since their traits are so extreme. If particular traits take on with other writers they may start to disregard other ones in favor of them.
<p></p>For example,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaffyDuck" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaffyDuck">Daffy Duck</a> didn't Flanderize into a greedy jerk overnight. First <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckJones" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckJones">Chuck Jones</a> gradually evolved the concept and then used it indefinitely Rabbit Fire onwards. Other directors took shades of it and applied it to their versions,  but still kept traits of his earlier screwball persona,  in the end though they eventually submitted and made him the same full on pompous loser character Jones used (if not more so).

            Sorry,  I didn't remember AB's death being that bad. I guess you probably won't like Scootaloo's either then.

            @Psi Just because a character isn't the focus of an episode,  doesn't mean that their character doesn't get expanded on. Besides,  TLR was not about her being stubborn. It was about her shame at the thought of having failed all of her friends and the town she had made a promise to.

            I don't really think the characters are on the decline either. OK,  Lesson Zero had Twilight acting a little extreme,  but other than that,  things have been pretty consistent for the most part in my opinion.

            I think I'm probably the only one who didn't find Lesson Zero on the extreme side. It's actually pretty consistent with how Twilight acts when she runs the risk of disappointing the Princess,  IMO,  with Swarm of the Century and A Bird in Hoof being the primary examples.

            I dunno,  AJ just seemed a bit out of the spotlight in season two. She seemed more the center focus in a lot of season one episodes or at least had more memorable scenes. In season two even in the two starring episodes she has,  she seemed kinda <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">Overshadowed by Awesome</a>,  with another one or two more abrasive characters having to keep the entertainment value.
<p></p>Maybe I just over obsess with AJ's flawed moments since I find full on Straight Men kinda dull.
<p></p>As such I actually like Twilight's heavier neurotics in season two,  as said though I just fear they might lose balance with it and other traits like her <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a> roles. That's usually how Flanderization starts. They make a very fun trait for a character but then utilize it to death.

            I don't think her reaction was that exaggerated either.  The <em>animation</em> was exaggerated.  If it had been more subdued,  everything else would have still been in character.  Also,  I'm just going to leave <a class="urllink" href="http://japaneseteeth.deviantart.com/gallery/33652203#/d4d2pvx">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> here again,  because it contains my explanation for why I think Twilight's freakout really isn't that overblown.  There really could be a lot riding on this.

            I just checked the opera lyrics in <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PF6" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PF6">PF 6</a> more closely and you're right,  they're completely different! It's just that the new lyrics fit so well that I didn't even notice they were changed!

            @ Japanese Teeth: I agree if animators hadn't given her a perpetual <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">Slasher Smile</a> she likely wouldn't have came off as deranged. Her acting otherwise is creepy but without it could come off as more nervous and frantic.

            I can't really say that anypony has been really out of character this season,  but as I said this season has been more prone to using more extreme <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterExaggeration" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterExaggeration">Character Exaggeration</a> then season one did. While it has rubbed some people the wrong way it has also made for a lot of fan favorite episodes.

<p></p>My first hope...is that it's longer than 13 episodes...and that it isn't the last season. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            Yeah,  I think as a whole season 2 took more risks.  Season 1 was largely safe; it didn't have spectacular "HOLY CRAP" moments like season 2 did,  but I think that they were consistently higher quality.  Season 2 is a lot more hit or miss because it took a couple of bigger risks that didn't always pan out.  So basically,  I think season 2 had some of the best and worst episodes of the show.

            For example,  Rainbow Dash has had more overblown pompous moments,  but it was balanced by also developing more prominant softer moments such as her sisterly treatment of Fluttershy. It works to make her more complex since we have the use of both. If only one extreme had been used she would have either <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">Took a Level in Jerkass</a> or risked losing all her abrasive traits and become dull. It's that tricky balance of flaws and strengths. It doesn't help the show started off on such a high with these.
