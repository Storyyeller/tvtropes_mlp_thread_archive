            So,  November. Well,  that's good. Unless I suddenly lose a lot of interest by then,  this may be the first season I'll follow live. Sort of. Since I'm not in America,  I can't use the official sources and have to rely on Youtube and stuff.
<p></p>Talking about "not in America",  is anybody,  who doesn't happen to be me,  visiting GalaCon?

<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> While I agree that it would be really interesting to have a show about that; I think it's probably too far outside the show's primary demographic. The children that it's aimed at aren't really going to be thinking about college-age issues. </div>
<p></p><span class="blue">I wouldn't be so sure.  MLP already deals with things outside children's issues.  The mane 6 are all adults with jobs after all.  I've never watched it,  but from what I hear Spongebob had a lot of episodes revolving around characters working awful part time jobs.  Dan Vs. is a kids show.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">I think kids will enjoy anything that's funny and compelling even if they don't relate to it all that strongly.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">As for the whole "is the series profitable enough to continue thing" I don't think we have to worry atm.  According to hasbro's latest profit info their girls section is stroooongly growing.  The show's been doing better and better and Equestria Girls seems to have succeeded as well.  Plus,  I recently heard that nowadays it's become as important or more important for shows to have a strong internet presence as it is to have ratings.  There are shows that consistently get low ratings but keep getting renewed for more seasons simply because they attract a lot of attention online.  Obviously mlp has that part down.</span>

            Yeah,  but Spongebob and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanVs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanVs">Dan Vs.</a> aren't specifically geared towards teaching lessons to kids; they're just supposed to be entertaining.  MLP does have the characters deal with adult issues,  but the lesson at the end of it is always something with a very wide application that isn't specific to adults.
<p></p>I'm not saying they couldn't make a show set in college,  just that if they did they probably wouldn't make the show centered around issues that are only applicable to older people.  Granted,  it's still possible for them to modify the demographic,  especially in a spinoff.

            To be more clear,  I was responding specifically to this bit:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">IT'd be interesting to see them deal with legit college-age issues,  too.</div>
<p></p>Meaning that I don't think they would make a show dealing <em>specifically</em> with college-age issues,  as opposed to as show set in college that deals with more universally useful issues.  Obviously that specific lesson is applicable to a lot of people; I'm just saying that in general I think they'd want to keep the lessons as widely relevant as possible rather than focusing on a specific (older than the target audience) age-range.
<p></p>It would be great to see them shake up the setting,  but the lessons will probably still be geared towards the same demographic.

            I think it would be better to keep the CMC together,  and make Twist the long distance friendship,  or have them write to their families instead. That would also give them an excuse to throw in Applejack,  Rarity,  and Rainbow Dash cameos from time to time.

            Glad to hear that S4 is coming out eariler then I expected.
<p></p>Also,  given how Cheerliee had no speaking appearences in Season 3 {Her only appearence for the whole season was a background role. People joke around about Rarity becoming a BG pony for the third season,  but Cheerliee actually did get reduced to BG pony status},  I wonder: Was there a teacher's strike going on around the time that the third season took place?<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

Applejack was the one who encouraged them to hang out together,  in a sort of parental style "you two should be friends way" and they gave it a try.

            Twist and Apple Bloom haven't really interacted much since "Call of the Cutie",  so it's kinda hard to say they're friends.  On good terms,  yeah,  but they don't spend much time together,  so having Twist move away wouldn't be <em>that</em> affecting.
<p></p>As for Babs,  she already lives in another city so having her move wouldn't really change much.

            Again,  I'd love a limelight episode with her and the Manehatan CMC. They could have an entire background cast with brief roles as if you already knew them if Manehatan had a show. And it would be cool to see an urban setting with a bit more grit than Ponyville.
