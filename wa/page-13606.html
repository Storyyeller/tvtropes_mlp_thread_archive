            So this episode seems to imply that all Alicorns are Princesses and all Princesses are Alicorns. (Yes,  even if you're a guy.) Here's hoping the next two episodes go into more detail exactly what it means to be an Alicorn and where the others come from.
<p></p>Was the Twilight turning into an Alicorn bit an idea thought up by the writing staff or did Hasbro command it?

            Well this episode DOES explain why Twilight deserves wings better than I expected.... but I can sum up my problem with the episode in 3 words: TRYING TOO HARD. The songs are NOT what the show was really about!!! This whole episode feels like it was written by someone WHO REMEMBERED what the show was like instead of what it is!  In short,  nowhere near my favorite.

            I just smoked my last four Marlboros in quick succession.  Why can't I just calm the fuck <em>down</em> and bask in the post-episode glow like a <em>normal</em> person?
<p></p>I think I'll go do something else for awhile.  Buy more cigs (I know,  I shouldn't.)  Take a much-needed shower.  A shave would be good,  too.  It's been <em>weeks</em> since I shaved,  and I look like a bum.

            My biggest concern with the show was that the music numbers would be too corny for me.
<p></p>I haven't been impressed with the songs in this series.  Not Phineas and Ferb level.
<p></p>I'm happy to say that I'm now impressed.  I'll be listening to Celestia's song again and again and again.

            I often enjoy the musical numbers,  so having a bunch of them was a treat.
<p></p>My favorites were the third and fourth ones. Third one was more in the vein of a pop song than a musical theatre song,  interestingly.

            I like that it was a musical,  and I liked the second(?) one. The one where everyone sings about their cutie marks. But as a whole,  I haven't really been a fan of the musical numbers in the show. The ones I like,  I really like,  but the rest just fall flat for me.

            Yup,  I also really like how the songs were used really well as exposition vehicle.
<p></p>A lot of things did happen in the episode,  but it didn't feel rushed (to me) since the songs condensed all the required story information.
<p></p>Not only that,  the number of songs also made it feel meaty.  Not only could I see the quality,  I could hear it.

            Also,  a lot of the animation in the songs was recycled from previous episodes and songs,  most egregiously <em>Smile Smile Smile</em>.

            So no one was looking after the Crystal Empire this episode. And since the Crystal Ponies are somewhat on par with sheep I'm betting anyone could show up and take control with sufficient charisma or force of will.
