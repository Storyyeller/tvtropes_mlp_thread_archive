            I don't think she really had a proper plan to deal with Discord. The letters were a good idea,  but I doubt it was any long term gambit on her part.

            @Lurker Actually,  Schneizel's most awesome gambit was a REALLY long running one that went off totally without a hitch and only failed due to something completely unexpected (to both him AND Lelouch) happening. and even then,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">his plan still left him with a card to play in the event that it failed to kill Lelouch</a>
<p></p>I reckon Celestia just wanted to get it over with quickly,  so she contacted Twilight to come and retrieve the elements before Discord could steal em. If that failed then the letters were a backup. She probably didn't WANT it to happen like that,  she just knew it probably would
<p></p>... what's wrong with me imaginingher as a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBitch" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBitch">Magnificent Bitch</a>? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">

            @storyyeller
<p></p>Let's see:
<p></p>He deduced who Lelouch was due to how he played chess. Figured that he was somehow connected to Suzaku based on their childhood and how oddly the two acted when they were around each other. He had his men trail Suzaku and through this he was able to find Lelouch when Lulu went to speak with Suzaku at the temple. He recorded the entire cnversation that the two had and after Lelouch escaped,  Schneizel manipulated Suzaku into telling him everything about Geass. (including Suzaku's own LIVE order that forces him to do anything to save himself if his life is in danger)
<p></p>He then had a nuke (which he manipulated Nina into making by playing off her loyalty to Euphemia.) grafted onto Suzaku's Lancelot,  knowing that the oncoming battle with Lelouch would put Suzaku in a position where either he'd use it willingly,  or his LIVE order would force him to use it in order to survive. (or they win the battle without needing to use it. Win-win)
<p></p>He had Lelouch's sister evacuated during the battle using a hidden plane. but since Lulu didn't know about that,  he assumed his sister was killed in the explosion. Schneizel knew about Lulu's utter DEVOTION to his sister,  and how the thought that he'd lost her would drive him into insane depression. He used this period after the battle to arrange a meeting with Lelouch's Army,  (knowing that Lulu himself would be too traumatized to make an appearance) and manipulate all of them against their leader (using the recorded conversation from earlier)
<p></p>He had Lulu's men lure Lulu into an ambush. Only a timely assist from Rolo (whom he had NO idea was going to help him) managed to save him.
<p></p>Even after all that,  he still had Nunally,  whom Lelouch still thought was dead,  and used the revelation that she was still alive to rattle Lelouch's mind and stop him from making rational strategic plans.

            So.....back on topic for us....
<p></p>Here are some funny qoutes I have gathered on my journey (either for irony or plain old coolness:
<p></p><em>I would like to see the demographics for this show. I would be surprised if a had a lot of guys watching this.</em> - Satanic Hamster,  Pg.2
<p></p><em>I curse this Wiki for getting me into this show. The first episode wasn't anything really mind blowing. The art was dazzling and the characters were cute but it didn't seem to have much to offer a 20 year old college student. But...for some reason,  I kept thinking about it...and thinking about it.</em>
<p></p><em>Especially Rainbow Dash. I mean,  come on!</em>
<p></p><em>Now I'm looking forward to each one.</em>- hybridelement,  Pg. 5
<p></p><em>I went to Mc Donald's for the first time in years just to grab some Friendship is Magic toys.</em>
<p></p><em>I have two Rainbow Dashes and a Twilight Sparkle now.&lt;3</em> – Uknokivi,  Pg. 5
<p></p><em><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess"> Dash will end up marrying Rarity's prince</em>.- boobuster Pg. 15
<p></p><em>I have watched some episodes.</em>
<p></p><em>I think I like it.</em>
<p></p><em>Cough.</em>- edvedd’s first post,  Pg. 22
<p></p><em>Question - how did this happen?</em>
<p></p><em>As in - how did the show get revived? How did it get suddenly popular on the internet? How did I watch four episodes of it without feeling disdainful?</em>
<p></p><em>And how did I admit that?</em>- Pannic’s first post,  Pg.29
<p></p><em>I would like to see an episode maybe looking more into Pinkie Pie's character or past,  as someone said in this thread (or the YF) that she seemed the least characterised,  mainly used for humour.</em>- Ian Ex Machina,  Pg. 33
