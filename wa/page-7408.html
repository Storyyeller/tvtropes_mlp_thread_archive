            well,  everything was pretty much non-stop Azula awesomeness across the entire finale. The only thing I didn't like was Toph learning how to metal bend.
<p></p>Azula was wonderfully savvy,  manipulative. and she just flat out execrted Aang while he was in the avatar state <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>and yeah,  I much prefer Zuko as a villain (not that I liked him much anyway) rather than... whatever the fuck he was during season 2

            let him decide for himself,  just becuase you didn't like something doesn't mean everyone will hate it,  there's still a lot of great episodes in season 3,  and there was NOTHING wrong,  asspullish etc... about the finale.

            well I already explained the metalbending to you,  and from what I hear it was become a standard thing that all earthbenders can do in Korra. So it doesn't make her super special powerful,  she just had the unique ability to sense the earth still inside the metal.
<p></p>OH and you gotta watch some of Season 3..gotta see how you like Hama.

<p></p>I didn't say that <em>I</em> didn't like the third season. I was saying that I think Ginger should avoid it judging from his current reactions and previous knowledge taste.
<p></p>For the record I did like season 3 of ATLA,  but that is neither here nor there.

            There's one episode that someone told me to watch up to at least. Apparently,  Ozai outsmarts them and Azula kicks ass WITHOUT her firebending. I'm assuming that's the eclipse episode.

            I will admit I think ginger should watch the first half,  but I don't think he'll like the second half as much.

            yup,  even after that it goes pretty downhill for the Gaang. there's a few "meh" epiosdes but not many,  only really pointless episode was <em>The Painted Lady</em> but it's still not as bad as <em>The Great Divide</em>.

            thre's only like 6 epiosde or so between <em>The Day of Black Sun</em> And <em>Sozin's Comet</em> Plus the finale has ultimate Iroh epicness.

<p></p>And I do think that you wouldn't enjoy Ember Island Players.
<p></p>And if you would watch any of the episodes between Black Sun and Sozin's Comet,  it would be Boiling Rock because Sokka and plot relevance.

            @Ace I just dislike feeling like the only reason Iroh hasn't killed ALL of them by now is merely because he's CHOOSING not to.
<p></p>It's just... not something I like... at all. and it's a true testament to how much I love Iroh when it's taken till NOW for it to get on my nerves
