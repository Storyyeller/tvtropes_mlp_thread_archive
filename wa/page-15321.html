            And that's wen the resident pink party pony prances in. Instant comedy potential right there. AJ learns that it's OK to have fun and Pinkie learns that sometimes you have to do what isn't fun so you can have fun later.

Like,  seriously,  the ending had me openly sobbing,  while I was at home with my parents. I have a great relationship with them at all,  but I'd hate for them to see me cry,  and there you go.
<p></p>But I mean,  you don't have to have AJ hurt to give her a break. I think the break would be a much stronger idea if she just finished all of her work. Like,  it's the off season or something.

            True. I could see her as going around town <em>looking</em> for work because she feels like she's wasting her time if she isn't doing something constructive,  i.e. working.  So somepony (Pinkie) has to teach her to really unwind.

            Speaking of,  another gloriously chaotic CMC episode. Sleepless in Ponyville was nice,  but I do kind of miss having them as a team doing their own thing. And I'll never understand the dislike for One Bad Apple,  it's one of my top eps in the season.

            It's not completely fair of me to hold this opinion,  but I feel like a lot of the hate is because a <em>lot</em> of people in this fandom have <em>serious</em> issues with bullying,  and think Babs got off too easy. I liked it a lot too.
<p></p>Oh,  and as a disclaimer,  so it doesn't look like I'm an ass who doesn't 'get' it,  I was bullied a lot as a kid too. I'd have a hard time being polite with my old bully if I ran into him in the street,  but I'm largely over it,  which I think a lot of people never quite get.

            Ah,  so there's a bit too much real life subtext for some people. For me personally,  the punishment wasn't important,  it was Babs being cured of her hatred and being able to break the cycle. Punishing someone who really doesn't want to repent won't do any good. Plus I think it managed conveying a fairly complicated moral kids could understand.

I've seen a <em>lot</em> of people who <em>hate</em> her because of her actions,  despite the fact that she only acted that way for a week,  realized it was bad,  and stopped.  I realize that bullying is a serious issue,  but seriously,  some people go overboard in how much they hate Babs for it.
<p></p>Granted,  I <em>do</em> think that everyone got off a bit light at the end of the episode,  but given that this is MLP we're talking about,  it's par for the course.
<p></p>And before this turns into another debate,  I'm going to bed.

            Well,  you seem to be pretty good with programming,  so it's worth a shot. It could just be your seeing a command or some such I'm not. I'm the only one who's tried visual novels,  so it's no wonder I haven't figured it out yet.

            Oh nice. Speaking of fictional jewlry,  I always thought it would be cool to make a The One Ring which actually has that glowing message when you heat it up. I'm not sure how you'd actually do that though.

            Some kind of metallic polymer that glows when heated a bit would do nicely.
