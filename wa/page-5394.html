            Okay... so.
<p></p>That episode was AWESOME. Like seriously,  probably competing for my favourite,  now. I loved Dash's relationship with Fluttershy,  how she genuinely cared about <em>her</em>,  not just winning the record. I think it was probably one of the first times we've genuinely seen that famous loyalty of hers,  and it was beautiful to see. I loved the moral of the episode,  too - the letter even had me tearing up a bit.
<p></p>The gags were all pretty great - I loved the beef-colt hopping in and screaming,  I almost chocked on my lunch when he first showed up. Fluttertree was great,  as was the paltry training montage.
<p></p>The incidental characters were great - Pegasi are my favourite tribe,  really,  and there were a lot of really cute ones here. Thunderlane,  those two with the cool hair,  plus that blue pegasus who got the 11.0 power. I think I'll be keeping an eye on him...
<p></p>The only thing that gets me about the episode is the whole record thing. If they lost 8 pegasi and just barely had enough to actually raise the water,  they wouldn't of come even close to the record - they would have hit about 880 at the minimum,  a hundred from the last record. There's no way 8 pegasi could combine to total 180 WP. And the record seems sort of unfair. Pitting a small town up against a city? Gee,  I wonder who wins...
<p></p>But yeah,  absolutely amazing episode,  to be sure. It made me just wanna give Shy a great big hug.

            Finished the episode.  I <em>really</em> enjoyed it.  It managed to keep RD from being a jerk,  her relationship with Fluttershy was great,  and I'm really happy with the way they handled Fluttershy's issues.  Especially in the fact that they didn't solve the problem by suddenly having Fluttershy be awesome at flying.  All the jokes and Derpy appearances were just the icing on the cake.  On preliminary watch it's definitely up there as one of the better episodes,  if not the one of the best.  Not to mention that they finally started using Spike as a supporting character again.
<p></p>@Keg: Or RD just screwed up the math when she was calculating how much wingpower they'd need to break the record.

            Why do people make a big deal out of Derpy appearances? I know we all love her and all,  but she didn't do anything in particular in this episode other than help out with the tornado. She is an actual recurring character that's shown to be a citizen of Ponyville,  ya know! :P

            I think it's just that it's good to know that the animators didn't edit her out after the fiasco.  It's just nice to see that she's still around.
<p></p>But really,  I was more surprised by the Fluttertree than anything else.  I was not expecting that at all.
