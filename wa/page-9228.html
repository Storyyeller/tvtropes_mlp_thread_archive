            @Pannic It's a LOT darker,  but BJ is generally considered more likeable. She angsts like NO OTHER though,  and it gets tiresome sometimes,  so be warned.
<p></p>I like them BJ and Pip for different reasons,  but I started liking Pip a lot more after she kicks her Mint-Al addiction.
<p></p>... why don't you like Pip again? Wanting to make the wasteland better but being natrually devious and dark minded is bad?

            @Pannic Wait,  who was that? you mean in Shattered Hoof? That guy was leading an organized Raider operation and was the reason why an innocent girl was traumatized. Notice how she still took issue with doing it. Killing him ends up making the wasteland a better place,  everyone involved knew that.
<p></p>Velvet is a technical pacifist. She's fine with using violence if NOTHING else works,  but she just doesn't want to do it herself. She'll help in an way she can,  just not by actually fighting. Which is fine in my opinion,  not everyone is cut out for killing.

            How about we have the character who's established as being opposed to killing people actually stand up for her stated moral values instead of,  over the course of one conversation,  completely changing her tune? Where's the fucking character consistency?

            Oh,  bullshit,  she pulls a complete 180 that flies in the face of the established characterization. People don't start a conversation with "this is murder" and end it with "what am I going to wear?" That's shitty characterization.
<p></p>And Littlepip is still full of shit for making her do it without even asking her ahead of time,  then cowing her into doing it,  and what's more,  she's full of shit with that "the wasteland hadn't done that to me yet" when she can't bring herself to mercy kill that raider later.
