            EDIT: Ninja'd.
<p></p>Also,  I thought Sisterhooves Social was actually pretty good; it's a lot more low key than some of the other episodes,  but the writing was really solid,  and I think the conflict of the episode felt a lot more natural than either of the past two episodes.
<p></p>Also,  <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkfUcu8hNCk&amp;">Pagetopper.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

<p></p>Please don't make the mistake of thinking that I disliked Sisterhooves Social. It was just a little low-key,  which isn't bad,  but it's not so much to my taste. As I said before the episode aired,  it's a Rarity episode and those are good. But I should elabourate. Rarity episodes tend to have more cliched,  dull-sounding premises,  but are executed brilliantly so that they are extremely good,  especially considering there premise. This is exactly what happened again in Sisterhooves Social. It was executed very well,  but the premise is less interesting than many other episodes and with the awesomeness of the second season,  I have to take points off somewhere.

<p></p>Sisterhooves Social was a great episode. I'm still not sure what order to place the season 2 episodes in yet tbh.
<p></p>Impressions of episode 9? I assume this sounds like another dull premise to you,  Sereg? (like you were just mentioning)

            A question on a different track: when did you guys figure out the identity of the Mysterious Mare?
<p></p>I had an inkling during the bus rescue. Something about the way she raised her hind legs was strongly associated with,  well,  you know who. And then with the dam scene,  that made me think <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shared identity</span>.

My thoughts exactly.
<p></p>At first I was like: those CMC again? And a conflict between sisters? This is gonna suck.
<p></p>But then I was like MOTHER OF DISCORD I NEVER EXPECTED THAT.
<p></p>Also  <br>- Nice,  is that applesauce?  <br>- No,  it's toast
<p></p>XD
<p></p>If it's a Rarity episode,  the scripting's gonna rock. It seems that for Dashie the opposite can be said.

<p></p>If you're referring to the troll-kid at the back,  yeah. I kinda stole the hairstyle colour scheme from a character in My Little Pony Tales (and he's even named after the same character) and I didn't even notice that he had the same colour palette as the mayor. If you're referring to the kid in the front,  that's a girl. D:
<p></p>Thanks for the feedback. I'll see what I can do to make him look less like the mayor.

            @Sessalisk I think the reason why some of the ponies' colors aren't working is in the background,  which shows a darker tone and is clashing with the vibrant and much lighter one adopted by the ponies.

            @Ginger: Exactly. I expect another typical Rarity episode as in it ends up a lot more awesome than it sounds.
<p></p>@Enlong: As I said earlier,  it was as soon as Fluttershy opened her mouth while they were complimenting Mare-do-well (who is best pony. After all,  a mix of Twilight,  Pinkie,  Applejack and Fluttershy with Rarity's style? How could she not be?)
<p></p>EDIT: Epically ninja'd.
<p></p>@Sessalisk: Also,  the black colt's features are too hard to see. I can't even see his horn. Otherwise nice.

            <div class="quoteblock">when did you guys figure out the identity of the Mysterious Mare? </div>
I guessed it's the mane cast as soon as they started dissing her. Thought it's only one pony and was fairly sure it's AJ until RD pointed out MMDW can predict stuff before it happens.

            @Sessalisk: The one next to the teacher.
<p></p>Hmm...Maybe we should try find other trends among episodes foccused on the same character. We've already commented a bit on Rarity episodes. I think that Twilight episodes tend to deal with fantastic versions of relatable problems in a way that works really well.
<p></p>EDIT: Also,  at first I thought that Mare-do-well was pinkie until the horn was revealed. That was obviously Twilight.

<p></p>Even before Mare-Do-Well's first rescue,  I suspected that the others would try to teach her a lesson. So I assumed right off that it was everypony alternating,  though I did briefly hope that Applejack would get the role to herself.

            Personlly,  I'm pretty sure that Applejack was the only one to get two rescues (balloon and bus),  though it's rather impossible to tell who did the balloon rescue,  since it could have been either Applejack or Pinkie.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Why did Twilight even need to take her hat off? Does a unicorn's horn have to be aimed at whatever it is you're magiking and the hat was getting in the way? </div>
<p></p>Perhaps it needs to be uncovered for any harcore magicking,  or it just makes it easier to focus if it's uncovered. Trixie did the same thing when she issued her challenge.
<p></p>Then again,  the horn was still under the mask...
<p></p>By the way,  I'm wondering what the limit on heavy-duty telekinesis is. She's been able to move many things at once,  and very heavy things,  but it seems like they need to be moved from a dead stop,  or close to such. For example,  she didn't move the water,  but the stones,  which had probably fallen heavily and dug into the bottom of the new river. And when she moved the Ursa,  she first had to pacify it,  presumably so it wouldn't struggle and break her hold.
<p></p>I'm guessing she can't move stuff that's resisting her pull too strongly.

<p></p>Perhaps. I've once speculated that the Ursa maneuver was a bunch of highly specific spells strung together.
