            <span class="blue">Well personally,  I used to really be negative about Western Animation in general.  I was a huge anime fan in my teenage days.  Pretty much the only western cartoon I ever got into was <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvaderZim" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a>,  and even that one I only liked about half of the episodes.  So I was pretty much an anime snob,  I think.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">That changed when I saw <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>,  one of the best shows of any sort I've ever seen.  It kind of opened my mind to the possibilities of western animation,  and since it actually was successful I kept hoping that it would spark some kind of revolution in western animation,  so that more shows with strong overarching stories would get produced.  That...didn't happen,  really,  but in case it did,  I started keeping an eye on the whole western animation scene,  hoping for a good show to come out.  So I started hearing lots of good things about this show.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">I <em>wanted</em> to like it.  I dunno if I'm weird,  but it never really bothered me that I might enjoy a show made for girls,  so I eagerly checked it out.  Unfortunately,  I didn't really care for it.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">So I stayed away for about 4 months,  but since I'm online a lot,  I came across more and more pony related stuff all over the place.  I got to know all the characters and their personalities without even <em>watching</em> the show,  and I started to get intrigued.  I decided to give the show another try,  and though my initial watch through was somewhat rocky after about 10 episodes I was pretty much hooked.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Still,  it wouldn't be anything more than just another show I've watched if I hadn't discovered this thread,  which greeted me enthusiastically and has become my favorite place to hang out online.</span>

            I didn't really care either way about the show until my friend kept pestering me to watch it. <span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> We made a deal that I would watch it if he read Homestuck. It ended up well for both of us.</div></span> I enjoyed it because it was actually well-written and funny. No particularly specific reasoning. <br> <br>@Ace. The only thing about that retune is that it's just a tad too squeaky and I can't imagine Pinkie singing it.

            <span class="blue">Things I like about it:</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">1) Very good characters.  Strong personalities,  strong flaws,  (mostly) consistent characterization.  It's rare to come across this <em>anywhere</em> let alone in children's television.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">2)  The happy,  bright,  optimistic tone.  The vast majority of things I watch/read/play tend to be rather dark.  I like dark fiction a lot,  but I get really tired of it if it's the only thing I take in.  I really like to have some cute,  happy stuff to balance it out.  Plus I've always liked cute things.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">3)  The unique,  well thought out fantasy setting.  I love fantasy,  but in general most settings tend to be rather samey,  falling into the same old cliches or just retreading once-brilliant ideas until they lose whatever uniqueness they once had.  One thing that can't be denied about MLP is it's not like any other fantasy series out there.  There aren't even any humans in it!</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Oh yeah,  and it's genuinely funny.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">I sure am getting verbose tonight.</span>

            So what was it about the rewatch four months later that made you more interested in it,  Blue? That you knew more about it going in?

            <span class="blue">I dunno I think I was just more open minded.  The first little bit I watched was a few minutes during the second half of Stare Master.  I specifically chose a random episode and started in the middle,  just because I wanted to get an idea of what the show was like in an ordinary episode (of course,  at that time I didn't know that episode didn't focus on the main cast.  I actually thought the CMC were the main characters).  I thought it was okay,  better than most cartoons I'd seen,  but nothing special.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">So then I tried to watch the first episode.  I got bored halfway through,  probably just because the whole episode is mostly introductions and I didn't yet have any affection for the characters so I just lost interest.  When I picked it up again months later,  I started with the second episode,  which basically followed a D&amp;D style dungeon sequence,  so i enjoyed it quite a bit.  The cheesiness at the end turned me off,  but I was willing to keep watching to see if it got better.  And it did.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">The show did take awhile to get me to like certain characters though.  I disliked Pinkie and Rarity quite a bit in the beginning,  which is odd since I think Rarity is my 2nd favorite now.  Rainbow Dash was always my favorite though,  I perked up anytime she was on screen.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">SERIOUSLY,  what is up with all of these words I am saying.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">EDIT:Sigh,  it's getting to be that time of night where I have absolutely no reason to stay up,  but refuse to go to bed.</span>
