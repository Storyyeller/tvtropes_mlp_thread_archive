            @ Fallen Legend: Not much.  I would've been on earlier,  but I got a flat tire friday night,  and after spending most of the day getting that fixed,  repairing my glasses,  having lunch with my brother,  and meeting with my gaming group,  it's been a full day.  what's the general consensus on the episode?

I had to sober up at friends before heading home  I got in the door maybe five minutes ago.  Watched the Icelandic comedy Astropia while chilling at my friend's  place.  Not great by any means,  but fairly amusing.  Especially since in one scene a guy recommends both Lost Highway and Bad Taste to a six year old kid.
<p></p>Good to hear the episode was good,   I had high hopes.  But for now,  I think I'll get some rest and check it out tomorrow morning.

<p></p>It's a little surprising to me that this seems to be a common reaction.  It was a good episode,  but I didn't think it was anything special.  Although I think I'm weird for considering Hearth's Warming Eve to be one of the best episodes.

            Right now we're playing Pathfinder,  where the DM has us running a nation-building mod.  It's been pretty fun so far,  I'm playing a half-orc Ranger playing spymaster for our fledgling nation.  We actually rotate between D&D 3.5,  Pathfinder,  and TORG.

But once you get back into the swing of things,  it's great fun.
<p></p>Anyway,  I'm kind of worn out and our Battletech game is starting earlier than usual tomorrow,  so I think I'm going to say good night.

<p></p>It was Chariot. No point in trying to hide these things when you could just go back 25 pages to look.

            since all you have to do scroll back on the thread to see,  I doubt. Chariot had issues with it that no one really understood and seemed to stem from him making a mistaken assuption based on the synopsis or something no one really understood.
<p></p>and we had one more,  can't remeber who that was just "Meh" about it,  rest loved it. or at least thought is really good.

            I think the issue everybody had with Chariot wasn't simply that he disliked the episode.  It was the <em>reason</em>.  That being "it wasn't about what I thought it was about",  which doesn't make any sense.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">That's not the fault of the episode itself,  though.  I mean,  if it had been advertised that way I'd get it,  but it wasn't.  None of the previews implied that that's what it would be about.  It boils down to "The episode wasn't about what I wanted so it's bad".
