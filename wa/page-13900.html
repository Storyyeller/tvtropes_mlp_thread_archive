            My granddad actually works with horses - or he did before a heart attakc sort of put him out of commission for a bit. Not sure if he got back into it. but he worked as a handler for horse rides for disabled children. He was a farmkid growing up,  so he was raised with them(He had his own horse... a black one named Nigger. Yeah.)
<p></p>I've always loved them too... I grew up nearby a summer camp that had a farm attached to it,  and one of the activities they offered was horseback riding. They never did anything advanced,  of course,  it was mostly just trotting around a trail on them,  but it was still fun. Everyone got assigned their own horse for the week,  and I always liked to buddy up to mine in between rides - talk to them while I fed them and stuff. Being the biggest kid,  I usually got the biggest horse. Massive thing called Scar. Either dumb as a stump or didn't give a shit about me I dunno,  but he was fun anyways.

<p></p>A long time ago,  there was a farm close to my home.  The guy owned horses...beautiful they were,  oh,  and a little donkey who gave up to the fence for pets and ear scratches. Never got to ride anything though.

            I went to a summer camp for a month each summer they called "Ranch Camp"  they taught English style riding and you got paired up with a horse for 2 week sessions.  You had to brush and feed and muck stalls.  I loved it.
<p></p>Maybe someday if I strike it rich...
<p></p>I figure though by the time I can afford to have horses... I will be too old to ride anymore.

            We've got some land down in this country's south,  and we have a few horses living there. You get used to each one having its quirks,  like one particular horse that likes to peek through the house windows to ask for food. Or another who got mad when a few were tearing up the shrubs and we had to lock them in their corral,  and beat the crap out of the rest once she realized they were locked up.

            I found a farm for sale near my place... 350k for almost 3 acres with a barn... house is double the size of mine.... zoned Agricultural Residential... I wish I could afford it so I could have horses and maybe some chickens and goats.
<p></p>My credit score is total shit right now from all my student loans though... and our house is worse less than we owe on the Mortgage so... not likely in the near future.
<p></p>By the time I can afford that much the same piece of property will be worth double that
<p></p>Its a bummer!

            Never been kicked by a horse but I did get bitten on the shoulder by one.  She wasn't happy that I was coming into her stall to get her saddled up and she whirled around and chomped down on me faster than I could react.
<p></p>I've had my foot stomped on ... and squished against the stable wall a couple times too.  Horses can be cranky sometimes!

            Yeah,  approaching a horse from behind is NOT a good idea. Unless you want to end up like that goat from Irish Zombie's tale. My dog was lucky to be just grazed by a kick,  and he still has the scar.

<p></p>I think it's mostly because there aren't many possibilities for shipping when all the major characters are female. Shippers default to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi">Everyone Is Bi</a> and when msot characters are female,  that means everyone is lesbian.

            @ RD
<p></p>Honestly,  I never thought of her as even bi,  let alone gay,  at all,  ever.  Apart from the fact that she hasn't demonstrated any sexuality at all,  I've known several sporty,  tom boy girls like her and they were <em>all</em> straight.  So I just don't make that connection.  Of course,  I'm used to this.  One of my gay friends was basically a vikings
<p></p>Nah,  if one of the cast was non-heterosexual,  I'd prefer it was some one much less obvious than RD (or AJ).

            I can see how people make the assumption though.  The rainbow is the one of the LGBT community's main symbols.  And for some reason people always associate butch with Lesbian.  I had to deal with that in Highschool a little bit since I kinda dressed and acted like a guy (wasn't very sporty though... I did like Soccer but could never make the cut for the team)
