            I'd like to see Gilda come back and learn her lesson; she's a jerk,  but I kinda got the feeling she could get better.  <em>Maybe</em>; picking on Granny Smith was entirely independent of her issues with Rainbow Dash and the mane cast,  so maybe not,  but... hm.  I could try to write that,  maybe...
<p></p>But Blueblood isn't a deep person.  He's very shallow,  and it's not really his <em>fault</em>,  but it's inarguable that he's unconcerned with anything but himself.

            To be honest there isn't as much of a reason to hate Blueblood as Gilda. Gilda was outright cruel,  Blueblood was just selfish. And he's in probably one of the highest positions of class despite having done nothing...he's just sort of par for the course,  so far as that stereotype goes. We just dislike him more because he messed with one of the best ponies.
<p></p>Also,  really late on this one,  but <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">Twilight is actually the latest in an ancestral line of Celestia's advisers. Her true parents gave her away when she was born,  in the hopes that she could have a normal life away from Celestia's servitude,  but Celestia found her again and is conditioning her loyalty.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">

<p></p>A lack of likable qualities or any expression of repentance for their actions or attitudes goes a long way in finding themselves is disfavor with the audience.
<p></p>Even Trixie wasn't that jerkish,  and she had other aspects to her,  and she was hammy so it was kinda funny.
<p></p>Snips and Snails almost got their town destroyed but they aren't jerks and said they were sorry.
<p></p>Luna tried to bring about eternal darkness and even she said she was sorry and put her jealousy behind her.

<p></p>Gilda just didn't seem to have anyone she truly trusted to call her out on being a jerk (Rainbow Dash might have gotten through to her if she wasn't being embaressed in front of all those ponies). Her along with Trixie I belive CAN change for the better.
<p></p>Blueblood is just a jerk down to the bone marrow. Wonder why Celestia let him turn out that way?

<p></p>That makes sense,  though.  Well said.
<p></p>Incidentally,  I was trying my hand at making some Celestia propaganda; the Summer Sun Celebration scene from "Cutie Mark Chronicles" seemed like it had a lot of potential,  so I tried mocking up a symbol reminiscent of the sunburst and Celestia's wings.  It needs some simplification still,  I think,  but <a class="urllink" href="http://i782.photobucket.com/albums/yy104/RedSavant/MedaloftheSunQueen.jpg">what do you all think?<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>◊</small>
