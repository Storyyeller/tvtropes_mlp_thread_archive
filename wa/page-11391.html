            Ooh,  Fallout Equestria discussion!
<p></p>Personally,  I haven't gotten to anything <em>particularly</em> painful involving the mane 6 being OOC,  apart from the banning books,  something about Rainbow Dash decrying Fluttershy as a traitor,  and that whole "Fluttershy killed us all" thing.

            Well,  the fact that the Mane Six weren't qualified was part of <em>the point</em>. The apocalypse was the result of a number of incredibly bad decisions <em>and I like it that way</em>. The smallest change would have prevented it. It upped the tragedy in a way I appreciated while highlighting how idealyc canon!Equestria is.
<p></p>Though I'll admit that FOE doesn't remind me of MLP:FIM. It reminds me of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatershipDown" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatershipDown">Watership Down</a>.

<p></p>EDIT: The book banning was admittedly bad and made me uncormfortable,  but I understood why it happened,  RD had <em>good reason</em> to call Fluttershy a traitor and Fluttershy "killing them all" was th complete opposite of what she was trying to do.

            I liked Watership down as well.  I have no bone to pick with dark stuff,  I just like to keep it out of my ponies.  If I wanted something grimdark I'd read something that was grimdark to start with.  If FE was just a Fallout fic I'd probably really enjoy it,  because I think it captured that franchise really well.  I'm just a fan of how much the pony aspects got modified to make it fit.

            It's not even that was done badly,  it's just that I'm not a fan of that type of combo.  It's just inherent to the thing that when you attach to franchises that occupy vastly different spots on the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism</a>,  one of them is going to have to get moved around.  Combining Ponies with Fallout,  you'd either have to introduce copious amounts of grimdark into the ponies (whereas in canon there isn't any),  or shove the Fallout parts firmly into <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> territory.  It can certainly be done well; I'm just not really interested in the combo.
<p></p>I do think I would have found it more palatable if it hadn't used the mane cast though; I could just treat it as an AU as long it focused on the OC's but once the mane cast showed up it just didn't work for me anymore.

            @Sereg: Again,  personal preference talking.  I've <em>never</em> liked <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFic">Dark Fic</a>,  and when Fallout gets involved in something that isn't already at that end of the spectrum,  it's kind of inevitable. But really,  I went into it expecting to really dislike it,  and it turned out better than I expected.  I can't say that I ultimately <em>enjoyed</em> it,  but given that it had a couple strikes going against it when I started,  I think it honestly did pretty well.
<p></p>It really comes down to one's approach to fanfic.  For me at least,  the whole reason I read it is because I want to expand on connection I built with the original work,  which is why I like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalFlavor" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalFlavor">Original Flavor</a> so much.  When things get changed that much,  it loses the connection and I'm less inclined to read it.

            I've never really had a preference or aversion as far as fanfic goes - I've got a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFic">Dark Fic</a> myself,  and I don't have any sort of preference for <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalFlavor" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalFlavor">Original Flavor</a>.
<p></p>My expectation when I went into the story was that it'd be good,  just not nearly as good as people were hyping it to be,  but as I read it and progressed through the story just got worse and worse for me as I found the protagonist completely unlikable.
<p></p>I did get the games over the summer,  though I'm gonna need to do some patching. The first game is gonna need some patching to fix the color,  I'm well-aware that the second has bug problems,  and the third seems to crash when I get to the end of the vault. I think I'll have to tinker with it so that it only runs on one of the cores.

            I went in expecting something with superior writing,  but found there wasn't really anything in the technical department that set it apart from other fanfics.  The setting has a lot of thought put into it,  but the author seems to be obsessed with spelling out every detail,  resulting in near absolute clarity at the cost of being filled with clumsy execution.
<p></p>That said,  my two biggest beefs are OOC moments.  One that's inconsistent with canon and another that's inconsistent internally.  The first is the whole placement of the school that effectively sent everything into nuclear apocalypse.  And it was placed there because Celestia apparently wants to make a tasteless,  extremely insensitive joke at Luna's expense.  Because Celestia is totally shown in canon to be an insensitive jerk.  The second was Fluttershy going entirely against her stated goal.  Which was to stop people from hurting each other.  On the first use of her solution,  she witnessed first hand that all it did was enable more suffering.  To continue on was to go directly against her motive in a way I felt was incredibly OOC.

            Celestia may not be a jerk,  but she <em>is</em> a tease. I think that that was what was meant there. It just turnedout badly.
<p></p>As for Fluttershy,  <em>I</em> wouldn't have given up as easily as you claim she should have. I totally agreed with Fluttershy...er...throughout the entire fic. She's the only character that I didn'tdisagree with <em>once</em>.

            Im thinking the placement of that school "on the moon" was a Trollestia thing.  Im pretty sure Trollestia is marginally canon.

<p></p>That was what I got out of it.  They're good at shooting one crack in the world with friendship,  but when the whole thing goes to shit around them they're as clueless as anyone else.  People overwhelmed by continuous pressure can and do do some shady stuff they wouldn't do otherwise.

            Hence the "marginally" in my post.
<p></p>She has been shown to be a joker.  It all depends on if you feel telling your sister youre sending her to the moon with her students is in line with the other jokes she's done.
<p></p>To be honest I think it fits with the Grimdark universe that is portrayed in FOE

            Sereg & Turtle: Yes,  she does have a bit of a trickster streak,  but there's a huge difference between what she's done on the show and making an insensitive joke about the time Luna was Nightmare Moon.  It's basically going "Hey,  sis,  remember that time you went all evil and murdered a bunch of people and I had to imprison you for 1000 years?  Yea,  totally gonna do that to your students!"
<p></p>And I didn't say Fluttershy should give up.  But she should have started looking for an alternate solution.  I cannot believe that she would proceed with something she knows would continue to hurt other people.

<p></p>see,  and that's where the support from their friends thing comes in again. If they were all together,  they would of curbed her <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">wide eyed idealism</a> and injected some reasoning into the situation. But instead,  she only had dash around to call her a traitor.
<p></p>if all 6 were there,  then AJ woulda shut Dash down,  Pinkie and Rarity woulda helped calm down Flutters,  and Twi would have steered her onto a different course.
