            It was "PATIENCE and PERSISTENCE!". But any variation thereon works as well.
<p></p>I would totally write this right now,  were I not knee-deep in the middle of a huge piece I had promised to release serially. But you're right,  we should take this to the fiction thread now.

She also said not to take her <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor">word as canon</a>,  but here is what she said anyways.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">This is how I had it worked out—— NMM did not just intend to make eternal night,  but to usher in an era of evil. Celestia had a responsibility to her "people" to protect them. Not many viewers noticed,  but the narration in the opening of the pilot said that Celestia banished her "reluctantly." She didn't want to do it,  but had to.
<p></p>Luna was no longer present,  jealousy buried her inside NMM. The possibility of drawing Luna's goodness out from NMM's form was not possible for 1, 000 years (she stayed NMM while in the moon)and Celestia did what she could to orchestrate the events the led to breaking the spell jealousy had put on her.
<p></p>I know this leads to many more questions (why 1, 000 to break the spell,  why didn't Celestia do more,  why Twilight and the gang,  etc.) but that's as far as I ever got with it.
<p></p>Hope that helps. Don't take it as canon,  though. The folks who are carrying on the show may have a different way of unfolding it someday.</div>

            Which of the Mane 6 to hang out with? Okay,  I have to cross out Twilight. Rarity and I would not get along unless I knew her very well already,  Pinkie would exhaust me,  Rainbow Dash and I would be unable to have a conversation that we both find meaningful,  that leaves Applejack and Fluttershy. First instinct is Fluttershy,  but that would result in a lot of awkward silence. Still,  we can bond over animals. As said earlier,  supper with the Apples would be awesome,  but while I like being useful,  a farm would tire me out very quickly. I'm not fit at all. So...probably Fluttershy.
<p></p>Also,  remember the shipping chart? I see that the first ship that I supported in the series (from the first episode in fact) isn't up there. I wonder if this implies that I'm very weird by brony standards.

<p></p>All we know is that Spike is younger than the mane 6,  Big Mac is older and Pinkie Pie is a year younger than Fluttershy (in addition to the ponies who are clearly meant to be older).

            Shipping with Spike at his current age makes me a little uneasy.  Although there's a handful of fanart with an older Spike (usually courting Rarity) and those tend to be pretty cute.
<p></p>So I think I'm actually starting to get the hang of these new pencils.  Note that while <a class="urllink" href="http://no-contest-creations.com/2011/11/17/mlp-fim-worst-fear/">this features Twi and Dashie<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  I think any of the main six could be in either position and the sentiment would be the same.

            Spike's still considered a "Baby" dragon. He's CLEARLY not a baby mentally,  so I feel sorry for him regarding shipping and stuff,  since he'll probably remain a "child" for decades.

            I only started liking her AFTER Luna Eclipsed. At least then she was given an actual personality.
<p></p>She still doesn't deserve all her popularity though (peronally,  I think Celestia's a MUCH more interesting character)
