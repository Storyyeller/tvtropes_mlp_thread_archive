            @Mage Yup. I love how I'm not allowed to complain about a lack of challenging opposition in this series because it's Slice Of Life,  but I'm ALSO not allowed to complain about Dany's lack of it in ASOIAF... why is that? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            Yeah,  the only times that arrogance has ever crossed that line (in Boast Busters and Fall Weather Friends,  for the primary examples),  it has been shown in nothing but a negative light,  and almost always blows up spectacularly.

<p></p>Because she is fighting powerful and competent opposition,  just opposition that due to the narative nature of the series we can't really flesh out?
<p></p>I mean...There's no real way for Danny's enemies to be more develop without creating ANOTHER POV character. (Which would also break Martin's insane rule about having only Westeros born POV characters)

<p></p>I. CAN'T. STAND JUSTIFIED ARROGANCE. It means they;re acting like a smug asshole but you're not allowed to take them down a peg because they ARE that good. So they for some reason have a RIGHT to be an asshole about it. Now,  I know for a fact that I've never met someone who shares that belief,  EVER.

            @Mage This is very simple. Have her lose. Have her be outsmarted. Have her escape a situation but at a great cost. There ar many ways to give her a worthy opponent without creating a new POV character.
<p></p>Plus,  any competence they do have gets thrown out the window the second they keep underestimating her. It ONLY serves to make HER look good

            yup Trixie is the prime pony example of it.
<p></p>and again I really don't mind RD's "arrogance" becuase we all know that while she IS good,  the attitude isn't a self congratulatory "Whoa I'm the best" just to bask in her own radiance. It's a mask she uses to hide her insecurities,  even from herself,  deep down she fears that she isn't as good as she thinks she is,  or that it won't be good enough to impress the Wonderbolt's,  or that she'll fail when it really matters.
<p></p>Really I think that's why RD is so insecure (and yes <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> just came to me while typing this) she knows she can fail,  and she is terrified of it,  becuase if she can fail at something,  even something little and ultimately meaningless ,  then what's to say she can't fail at something big,  that when her friends are counting on her to help them,  she wont' fail then too. More then anything,  more then not getting on the Wonderbolts,  more then any personal humiliation,  RD fears not being able to be there for her friends when they really need her.

            @Ginger You are not the only person we are talking to here. Do not assume that every statement displaying enjoyment of something you dislike is directed at you. We are merely discussing the portrayal of arrogance in this show,  not trying to convince you of its merits. You need to calm down.
