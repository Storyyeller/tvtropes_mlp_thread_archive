            @Blue Every character is either a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Badass" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Badass">Badass</a> or someone who arbitrarily flips back and forth between the two.
<p></p>Anyway,  Rainbow Dash would be the sort of villain who always tries to prove she is better than the hero.

            Meh. That's a script writing. Like saying <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnePiece" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnePiece">One Piece</a> characters are all "large hams"  or "evil bastards"  when it's really just how the world is built. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam">World of Ham</a>.  Also,  that's not true. Anya,  Andrew,  Cordelia and Harmony are none of those. And they're my favorite characters of the Buffyverse. They're really aren't that many snarky folks in the Buffyverse. There are funny moments from people,  but I wouldn't call them automatically snarky because they're given a funny line.

            <span class="blue">@Dalek: Ah,  okay,  so it was something incredibly vague.  Being snarky does not make them all the same sort of characters by any means.  Same with being badass.  In an action oriented show it's pretty much a given that all,  or at least most,  of the characters are going to kick ass at some point.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">You could say the exact same thing about MLP:FIM.  Every one of the Mane 6 has performed feats of badassery,  and all of them have had their snarky moments.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Anyway,  I'm not annoyed or offended that you don't like Whedon,  I just could not comprehend what you were trying to say there.  I wouldn't even consider myself a fan of his,  really,  though I do like some of his works.</span>

            I consider Whedon an abusive boyfriend. He tells you everything will be different,  makes you love him again,  AND THEN BREAKS YOUR HEART AND MAKES YOU SOB AT HOW SHITTY THE RESOLUTION WAS ;A;
<p></p>So yeah,  I'm a fan of Whedon. Which means I'm obligated to hate the bastard for when he decides to stop having fun and do stupid shit.
<p></p>You cannot like a show. Plenty of folks do. It just seems odd to hate it for a reason like that,  when there are SO many better reasons.

            What annoys me is that there's no variety. You could give 90% of the dialogue to another character and it wouldn't matter because they're all snarky,  interchangeable badasses.
<p></p>In a good show (like MLPFIM) you can't do this. For example,  you couldn't give a Rarity line to Applejack.

<p></p>Sorry,  what was that? I heard the name Cordelia and I had to go break something,  continue.
<p></p>I have no illusions about Joss Whedon,  he's just another guy that just happens to be geek famous for some reason. Sure Buffy was cool but I really don't see why he's such a big deal.

            I liked Cordelia. She was awesome. She was a bully who wasn't just written to be a bully,  and it was awesome. No " wah wah I'm getting out my repressed bully issues" which I can't stand with most generic bullies.

            <div class="quoteblock">: In one of the first episodes the pilot,  Wash,  is musing about River Tam having revealed herself to essentially be a telepath.
"I dunno. Telepathy. Kind of sounds like science fiction to me." He says.
"Dear,  we live in a space ship." His wife replies.
"Oh yeah." He responds,  raising an eyebrow.
This just annoys me and is the primary reason I dislike this show. Science fiction changes with each new generation and I would have hoped a fan of the genre would know this. This is like nowadays someone saying 'I dunno. Sounds like science fiction' and being rebutted by someone saying 'But we have toasters'. Yes,  in earlier centuries that might have seemed like sci-fi and there is a point in there somewhere,  but the real reason this statement was made is because being on a space ship will be associated with science fiction by the VIEWER.
Not by the characters but by the people watching the show.</div>
<p></p>This. So much this.

            That comes down to style preferences. Not everyone is gonna like Whedon's sense of humor,  and that's ok.
<p></p>That being said,  haven't seen the scene,  don't know the context,  not gonna judge. Maybe it's a weak line. He has those. Whedon has had some really stupid episodes. But haven't seen the show,  don't know. Just going to make arguments based on Buffy and Angel. AND PAIN.

            He does have SOME points,  but to me they on the whole smack more of personal taste than any real reason to call it objectively bad in any way. Of course he does still recognize the show is good,  so there's that much. I suppose he realizes his issues come down largely to taste.

            Blue: I know. It's mostly,  well,  I REALLY loved certain characters. The idea of ONLY having them for a handful of episodes is what kills me. That it was cancelled.

            Firefly,  methinks,  was mostly loved because nobody had to see it continue; so everybody imagined that if it had continued,  it would have been exactly the kind of show that they like.  Those who were attracted by the humor and style/atmosphere imagine that those elements would have developed; those who were more focused on the characters and story imagine that those elements would have developed,  and everybody imagined that the writing would maintain its excellent quality.
