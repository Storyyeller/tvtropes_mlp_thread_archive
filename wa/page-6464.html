<p></p>The last season doesn't actually count. Disney fired the series creator and show runner and hired a bunch of idiots.
<p></p>Eventually the creator bought back the rights and started a comic book series continuing the show that completely ignored the third season as well,  except for two episodes.

            @ginger: Well,  the protagonist(Blueblood) <em>does</em> discover his intentions,  but that's not the original reason for him going back. See,  he was a bit attached to that particular slave - he was trying to rehabilitate her,  trying to set her free. He didn't really care for the idea of her being in somepony else's hands. So he treks back across a <em>desert</em> to get her back. It's along the way he realizes what's going on - he has the benefit of context,  you see. The ponies in the country he's visiting don't really pay attention to much outside the borders,  while he's a diplomat to the country they're allegedly waging war with. He's aware of the tripe the propaganda is. Instead of arguing counter to it,  though,  he appeals to better natures,  convinces,  persuades,  and even logics a bit - mostly that the country is both very tiny and very much nestled between both the country it will be going to war with,  <em>and</em> the countries largest ally. In the end the villain is actually defeated a bit by his own secrecy - had the countryfolk been <em>aware</em> of this secret weapon,  which is both plentiful and only useable by EP's(All of the ponies in the country are EP's),  they might have been more willing to fight. In the end he basically amasses an army and leads them against the chancellor's own army,  as by this point the chancellor basically in control of the military. The final confrontation actually has almost no violence,  since neither Blueblood nor the chancellor are violent ponies. They just look outside,  have a small ethical debate,  and the chancellor realizes he's lost. Blueblood's side is better,  so the chancellor calls off his army and the war. The country never knows about all the plans,  the country 'suffers' a revolution,  and things become peaceful.
<p></p>@Ils: Ah,  well... thank you. I don't have much to do but develop them,  and it IS sort of my job to develop things in depth...

<p></p>Despite being the creator,  Toon Disney owned the rights.

Wait,  wait. Is this the same one that chewed him out on that one trip before White Brook bought him? The same one he lamented about when he pushed himself to injury?

            @Kyler: Welcome to the wide and wonderful world of the entertainment industry! In order to get money to make a project,  someone has to buy it. If they buy it,  they have control. It happens in every industry - <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalLegends" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalLegends">Brutal Legends</a> got <em>fucked</em> by activision,  for example,  although they didn't technically have the authority to <em>fire</em> Schafer.
<p></p>But basically,  whoever's funding your project <em>owns your soul</em>.
<p></p>Also yes,  that is the very same slave!
<p></p>@ginger: Eh. I'd honestly recommend <em>The Colour You Bleed</em> again anyways - I personally had a lot of fun writing the villains,  and I think they're solid. Plus lots of <em>character development</em>...(not sure how much you like that,  actually).

            Aw,  why not?(Also the second story is an independent plot; all you'd be missing is a leap in Blueblood's character)

            Eh,  the villains don't even interact with the main characters all that much - Iron Towers,  the main villain,  is near hyper-competant in his few appearances,  taking down a pony reputed to be one of the most skilled mages on the continent. The only reason he loses to Blueblood is because he's batshit fucking insane,  and basically runs into walls trying to kill him.
<p></p>Buuuut it's pretty clear at this point that it's hard to convince you... maybe just read the first chapter,  at least? you might see you like it more than you think,  and if not it's fairly conclusive so you can pretend there's no more of it.

It genuinely makes me uncomfortable to be declared brilliant like that,  <em>especially</em> if it makes other people sad/angry/whatever.

            Yeah,  but Blueblood is such a prick that character development for him <em>should</em> be primary. If you can actually feel bad for him,  that's something.
