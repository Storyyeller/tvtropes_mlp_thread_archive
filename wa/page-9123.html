<p></p>@ginger And just because someone is villain it's not make me interested.
<p></p>And Stygnus (or what name of that batpony) is only interesting because in my headcanon he is pony Barney Stinson and try to sleep with all mares pretending to be mute.

            Actually,  he speaks in the super high pitched sounds bats use for echolocation.  Which in practice makes him effectively mute to anypony without bat ears.  So he carries around a sign Derpy style.

            But according to you,  she <em>doesn't</em> have a strong personality.
<p></p>For the record,  I kind of agree.  I tend to forget she's in the room with everyone unless she's doing something,  which you wouldn't think should be possible for an alicorn.

            sigh... what I mean is. Right from the off she's not like other Alicorns. She's unique.
<p></p>If I was writing this story,  I'd have her be a completely ordinary alicorn chosen arbitrarily by the Goddess to go into Hoofington (since as she explained,  the pain of one alicorn in Hoofington is manageable) . When we first see her she's EXACTLY like ANY other Alicorn,  but as she travels with BJ and co,  and as the area of Hoofington takes it toll on her,  she slowly grows more and more apart from the goddess and begins to show hints of her true personality.
<p></p>As things stand,  she STARTED off with too much personality.
<p></p>Ah,  but what the fuck do I know? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            @Crow but as she stands her presense means nothing. Nothing.
<p></p>It's a bit like the problem I had with Zuko. A redemption story ISN'T interesting if the redempee is already well on his way to redemption before the story even starts.
<p></p>Same here. A "growing individuality and personalized sense of self" story isn't interesting if the character is already well on her way down that road from the beginning
