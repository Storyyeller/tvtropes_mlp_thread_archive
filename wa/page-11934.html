            I see it as this way. Applejack is the oldest. She was a late bloomer in getting her cutie mark and th others said nothing about being a late bloomer. She's also one of the most mature.
<p></p>Fluttershy is second oldest. She was already starting to grow into her awkward teen body and we have confirmation that she's older than Pinkie.
<p></p>Rainbow Dash is the youngest. She was first in her class to earn a cutie mark. Making her an early bloomer. Fluttershy probably was in a higher year <em>and</em> failed a year. Rainbow is also more immature.
<p></p>Pinkie is second youngest. Her sisters hadn't earned cutie marks yet and she's morem immature. We also know that she's younger than Fluttershy,  but only by a year.  She's also still an apprentice.
<p></p>Rarity is third oldest. She was already in a responsible position in school and is one of the more mature. She also earned hers old enough to start worrying about when she'd get hers.  She's also a succesful businessmare already.
<p></p>Twilight is third youngest. She was trying to get into school making her likely younger than Rarity and Fluttershy. Yet if she was too young compared to the others,  it would suggest that most who attend Celestia's school don't have cutie marks which would be strange from what we've seen. She's also more mature than Rainbow and Pinkie and appears to have completed at least one degree.

            @Blissey,  wow,  the perfect fusion of two things I dislike vastly.
<p></p>I see Rarity and AJ as the oldest,  Twilight and Pinkie Pie as the Youngest and the Pegasi somewhere in the middle.

            It's only really based on Homestuck format-wise,  though. It doesn't really have anything that similar to HS otherwise.

            Okay,  it might just be me,  but does anybody else find the general layout of the tumblr blogs aggravating?  I mean,  the comics themselves can be awesome,  but half the time I can't help but think that general readability would be vastly improved by using a more webcomic-type format.  Using a blog format means that the comics are in reverse order (making archive binging a pain),  it's hard to look up a specific post because there's usually no index,  and you have to click through each individual image to read anything rather than having it be full-sized from the get-go.

            No,  those are all real problems,  plus the one where it makes tall images almost impossible to read because it scales them to fit the screen,  but it's offset for me by the visual layout of the site. Things look good on tumblr,  and most webcomics have buttugly website design.

            I have an account,  and I'm not aware of any way to do that.
<p></p>I think tumblr <em>does</em> have a good basic layout,  just one that isn't well suited for hosting comics.  Something like the setup that <a class="urllink" href="http://equestria.fadri.org">And That's How Equestria Was Made<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> has would be way better for that.

            On the other hand,  tumblr makes it so much easier to track things you're watching. That's probably its biggest draw for me.

            I agree J teeth. Basically Tumblr is good for keeping track of other blogs but it's format leaves a ton to be desired.
