            @Sereg: Yeah,  It's a bit tough to say for <em>sure</em> because Celestia and Luna obviously didn't ascend in the same way,  but I can still say there's a link because as far as we know every ruler of modern Equestria has been a bearer of an element of harmony. (Not counting Cadance because she rules the Crystal Empire).
<p></p>@Keg: Way back when I was actually kicking around a fic idea in which Vinyl was an albino,  which explains the eye color and fact that she wears shades all the time.  I still might headcanon that idea.  Haven't decided yet.

            If I were to include Vinyl Scratch in a story,  I would give her a very gentle,  meek personality.  Not necessarily shy on the level of Fluttershy,  but more someone who expresses herself through music she plays and is kind of dreamy and a bit spacey.  In my version,  she became a DJ so that she could share music with everyone.  I also once found a fanfic where she was Rarity's cousin,  which kind of fits since they're both white unicorns and the first time she appears,  she's being the DJ for Rarity's fashion show.
<p></p>On the subject of the "hurrying to school and finding out that classes are cancelled" thing,  I could see that being a CMC story,  where they (or one of them?) is late to school and in a rush,  only to find out that school is cancelled for the day because Cheerilee has the flu.  The CMC decide that they're going to try to get their cutie marks in being doctors and try to take care of Cheerilee,  but since they don't know much about caring for a sick pony,  they mess up (like in the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorMoon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a> Nurse Venus story) and end up getting someone to help them.  In the end,  they learn a lesson that it's okay to ask for help,  especially if you don't necessarily know how to do what you're trying to do.

            @JT: Thanks!  That would be an even more interesting story if the one the CMC went to for help was Fluttershy (for whatever reason) and Fluttershy sympathized because she did something similar where she tried to take care of Philomena without knowing what the problem was or even what kind of creature she really was.  Or Big Macintosh so that he could have a shiptease with Cheerilee,  since "helping a sick person and falling in love with them" is probably a common romance plot too.
<p></p>The only main problem would be the question of "Why doesn't Cheerilee get a substitute teacher?"  Come to think of it,  that could be another episode idea in itself,  where somepony else tries to be a substitute teacher for Cheerilee (the most obvious would be someone like Twilight but it could also be used to give a background pony some more characterization as well).

<p></p>The latter panels were during Magical Mystery Cure when the town was having a meltdown due to critical lack of Pinkie Pie.
<p></p>If anything,  that's about as canon a couple as you're gonna get beyond explicitly being married.

            Yeah,  couples fight all the time without breaking up. And everyone in Ponyville was acting like that and cheered right back up when Pinkie came back to normal.

            What they said.
<p></p>Anyway,  I finally got my hands on the microseries comic,  and I basically agree with what everyone said. The writing and characterization are good,  but the art needs a bit of work.  Also,  I found it amusing that Summer starts out basically treating Twilight the same way Bon Bon treats Twilight in my story.

            See,  my understanding of the Element of Magic is that it is more like faith in/desire for friendship.
<p></p>I believe this because of both the situation that caused Twilight to discover it,  and the way she only lost her colors during Discord's rampage when she lost faith in her friends and was ready to just leave.
