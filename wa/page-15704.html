            As far as Disney Goes... I think I prefer <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRescuers" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRescuers">The Rescuers</a> to most of their movies? I'm actually trying hard to think of what my favourite might be,  but trying to think of favourite animation always brings me back to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSecretOfNimh" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSecretOfNimh">The Secret of NIMH</a>.

            Facilier is pretty cool too.
<p></p>Speaking of villians,  I find it really strange that they basically made Captain Hook the underdog and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">The Woobie</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeterPan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a>. I mean giving your villian Offscreen Baby Roasting as a hobby isn't enough to make them a good villian. They also need to actually be a threat.

            Well Colin gave me a brief explanation of what Disney is. What he said is that they are a company that makes,  or has made,  very well made movies for foals that even adults can enjoy.
<p></p>I have a similar thing here in Equestria. There's this book company that also makes well made literature for foals. Despite their age target,  I still find the books I've read to be really good. One of my favorites is <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuLan" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuLan">A Mare's Stand.</a> To put it briefly,  it's about a unicorn mare named Moon Light. Changelings have taken over several cities and will be invading Manedrid next. There is a draft sent out in the hopes that it will thwart the changeling invasion. Moon Light's dad is on of the ponies that has been assigned to go. However,  he gets hurt before he can pack up and leave,  but he's too stubborn to stay behind. Moon Light takes his place behind her father's back.
<p></p>I'd say more,  but it would spoil the story.

            "Friends on the Other Side" is probably the best song in <em>Princess and the Frog</em>.
<p></p>I remember watching <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSecretOfNIMH" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSecretOfNIMH">The Secret Of NIMH</a> back in first grade and all the kids freaked out when the rats were injected with needles. I went back to my old teacher a couple years later,  and asked if they still showed it. They didn't. XD Which is a shame; I really loved that movie back then.

            @Gwen: Yeah,  I first saw it in school too,  after we read the book in class. I don't actually remember having an issue with the lab flashbacks... though considering I think that was only fifth grade,  it wouldn't have been <em>too</em> surprising if I had.
<p></p>Between all that,  the Great Owl,  and the first scene in the rosebush,  it's a hellva movie to show kids,  I'll admit.

<p></p>SAW the sequel to the movie... I think I thought it was okay as a kid,  and kind of stupidly endearing as an adult. Not so bad if you divorce it from the original,  really.

<p></p>One other thing about <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaryPoppins" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaryPoppins">Mary Poppins</a> that I forgot to mention earlier. During the rooftop scene when she mentions that they need to get out of the night air,  did anyone else think 'night air' was a euphemism for 'toxic levels of air pollution'?

Of course,  the authors took some liberties with the original folk tale. While the story originated in Saddle Arabia,  it was set in Chineigh (or at least,  Chineigh as imagined by a Saddle Arabian who'd never been there him/herself). And there were two unicorn who granted wishes—one trapped in a jar,  and another trapped in a ring.
