            Very true. It was a very nice change of pace. And only one part of the reasons to do well with the tornado was something unique to Rainbow. The rest of the team really did want to give this thing their all,  and Rainbow knew that.
<p></p>Another thing that surprised me about the episode was how the issue flipped from performance anxiety to agonizing about not being able to make a huge contribution.
<p></p>And thus,  MLP teaches us all a valuable lesson about voting.

            I wonder how the voting moral translates in various countries.
<p></p>Unlike in the US,  we in SA <em>know</em> which party will win long before the election,  but as we have proportional representation,  we can still affect the number of seats each party has in parlament. Also,  when the ruling party has at least two-thirds majority,  they can change the constituation,  which they haven't done in a while,  but those who support other parties would prefer not to give them the oppertunity should they decide to.

            I must admit that I sometimes feel like my contribuion to a group activity was <em>negative</em>,  so this was a message that I could have done with as a teenager. It may have helped with some rather dark periods in my life. It's not pleasant when you believe that the lives of everyone around you would improve if you died.

<p></p>As a teenager I went through a period of depression and I've always had rather fragile self-esteem. I also had rather high expectations placed on me that I felt incapable of living up to. I blamed myself for many things,  some rationally,  others irrationally (like the death of my mother). I developed a lot of self-loathing and cowardice was one of the few things that kept me from suicide. The fact that my step-mother was Afrikaans when I'd been raised as English South African didn't help. (The two groups are culturally very different,  especially when it comes to raising children. They also have a history of disliking each other).
<p></p>EDIT: I actually <em>should</em> see <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulLife">It's a Wonderful Life</a> sometime,  but I'm quite familiar with the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot">It's a Wonderful Plot</a> trope.
<p></p>Anyway,  depressed people aren't the most rational. I <em>did</em> get treatment,  which helped.

Looked at panels 6-8 and went "Twilight joined the Phyrexians,  NOOOOO!"
<p></p>She was probably enticed by their shared appreciation for the golden ratio.

            That doesn't guarantee that Twilight didn't run away from Equestria to join them in Mirrodin.
<p></p>Though Twilight would have to be a planeswalker for that to happen.
<p></p>But it wouldn't be a big surprise if she were. But she would need a reason to run away to another plane.
<p></p>Maybe this is discorded Twilight?
