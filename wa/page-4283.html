            @Light Phaser:  I am totally going to respond to your thing about Castlevania in the pony thread!  We are such rebels.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> "You are all alone; now fight"/ Your whip has a delay! Jump once,  no retries! Grab as many hearts as possible!/ To add frosting to the cake of beauty,  there is a massive attention to detail in any given game/  Some of the enemies,  although very annoying for the most part,  are very creative. </div>
<p></p>Based on all this,  I highly recommend you try out <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSouls" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a> if you have a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS3" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS3">PS3</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XBox360" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XBox360">Xbox 360</a>.  I've heard Castlevania fans say it is "the best Castlevania game ever made" despite not literally being a Castlevania.   It's not a platformer at all,  but aside from that most of the things you like about Castlevania are present:  Serious challenge that forces you to actually develop skill,  beautiful,  intriguing environments,  a metroidvania style semi-open world to explore,  unique,  and creative enemies of many many different types.  The only thing that doesn't really match up is the sense of 'surrealism' you mentioned,  but that is replaced by a very fantastical setting that nonetheless feels very grounded in realism.  Don't want to clutter the thread much more though,  so if you are interested feel free to PM me!
<p></p>Crap,  I need something pony related for the pagetopper:
<p></p><center><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="425" height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_ytsOpYxKks?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p></p>Pinkie's sisters:  I'd love to see them,  grown up,  and see what they're like.  It'd be cool if they were real serious,  but still fond of Pinkie.
<p></p>What would I be doing here without this thread?  Probably still over in the Yack Fest.

            Hmm,  to be perfectly honest,  I joined <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropes">TV Tropes</a> simply to finally have my own account here (my cousin had his logged in on this computer but he moved quite a while ago). I made my way to the pony thread after watching "Applebuck Season" for the very first time... and I never went back...

<p></p>Whoa,  that game sounds right up my alley! I'll have to check it out,  but unfortunately I don't own a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS3" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS3">PS3</a> nor a 360 to play it on.

            Yeah,  I don't know how many people read my filibuster from a week and a half(man I was in a mood lol) ago but I talked about how I had waited a year and some before deciding to create a profile and even than I didn't do much posting unless it was a particular show or episode that I liked. I stuck mainly to the articles,  which how I eventually got hooked on this show before even watching an episode. (I'm seriously still amazed at how indexed it is.)

            I was a troper before I discovered it,  so I'd probably just be mainly posting on the anime topics rather than <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a>.  The site in general did introduce me to this show,  though.
<p></p>About the Derpy thing,  I can understand why they changed it,  although I'm not exactly sure what I feel about it.  Both of her voices are okay to me.  I'm not sure if they're going to give her a different name in a future episode or just leave her with no name mentioned.  I'm used to calling her "Derpy Hooves" but if she gets called by a different name in the show I could probably adapt.  I still like her,  no matter what her voice sounds like or what her name ends up being.

            I didn't even know this site <em>had</em> a forum before ponies... The first episodes hooked me in so badly that I read the trope page and proceeded to voraciously consume everything related I could find,  until a google search happened me upon this very thread... I got known,  hopped in,  and the rest is history.

            It's an unfortunate element of the thread,  but in a way it is fair. People just tend to be more inclined to help those who help them. Keeps it from becoming a me-fest.

<p></p>It's just that I find it terrifying,  you know,  reading someone's work in progress... I kinda suck at being a critic... I mean,  I like... <em>tropering</em>,  talking about plot and characters,  and pointing out interesting points of departure to explore in fanfics... But I would know next to nothing about pacing or emotional feels or proper descriptions... and there's there's <em>something</em> blocking me from reading anything that hasn't been actually <em>released</em>...
<p></p>Why am I so scared...

            @The Handle: If you'll permit me to be a bit blunt,  I don't see the point in asking for an opinion when you don't have anything written out yet.  I don't read or write fanfiction,  but I believe your work should stand up on it's own without any sort of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">supplementary material.</a>  Posting a comment that basically says "this is how the world works in my story" violates that.  Your submitting something that the reader shouldn't see at all.  Any important info about the setting should come across in your writing,  dropped carefully throughout the narrative in a way that feels natural.
<p></p>@Everyone else: My dog tried to fight 3 other dogs and at least as many cars this time.  I really think she has a problem.  Also,  why do people just let there dogs hang out in there front yard without a leash?  Don't they care about their safety?
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I myself <em>love</em> critiquing other people's works,  and I have been told that I am very helpful by numerous people,  so anyone who needs a critique is welcome to approach me.  I just don't do fanfiction,  because I don't know how to properly criticize it.  Many things that would be considered glaringly bad writing in an original work seem to be accepted in fanfic by its very nature,  so I don't think I'll be of any use examining it.
