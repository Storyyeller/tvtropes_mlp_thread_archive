            You know what would be great? If Hasbro did some outtakes on a number of MLPFIM episodes.
<p></p>For example,  at the end of "The Best Night Ever",  Princess Celestia is spending time with the Mane 6. You could have outtakes showing Celestia having conversations with them "off the screen".
<p></p>Take Rarity. I can imagine a conversation between the two going like this:
<p></p><ul><li> Celestia: So,  Rarity,  what did you think about Blueblood?
</li><li> Rarity: OH,  Princess! That beastly Blueblood is the worst example of a prince that I have ever met! How could that <em>ruffian</em> be your nephew and a prince?
</li><li> Celestia: Well,  there's something you need to know. He's not my nephew.
</li><li> Rarity: He's not?!
</li><li> Celestia: No. He's not a prince,  either. He's actually a duke.
</li><li> Rarity: But...how can that be?! Everypony calls him Prince Blueblood,  nephew of Princess Celestia!
</li><li> Celestia: Well,  to be honest,  he's an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Horse</a>. He claims to be my nephew and a prince because he's just that self-important and self-centred.
</li><li> Rarity: Unbelievable! But then,  why have you done nothing about that?
</li><li> Celestia: I have considered it,  but then I thought,  why bother? It would only draw more attention to himself,  and the more he has,  the happier he is. We all prefer to shun him and not speak to him at all unless absolutely necessary. Still,  you did ruin his night,  didn't you?
</li><li> Rarity: Yes,  I did! I even destroyed my slipper,  because I never want him to find me!
</li><li> Celestia: You did? Oh,  Rarity,  you didn't have to do that. As I said,  Blueblood is so self-centred,  he most likely didn't pay any real attention to you. In fact,  I daresay that he will have forgotten that you have ever existed. Besides,  he is so unromantic that he wouldn't trouble himself with returning a slipper to <em>anypony</em>,  princess or otherwise.
</li><li> Rarity: "..."
</li></ul><p></p>Like I said,  it would be funny if anything like I just outlined happened! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

<p></p>I mean,  c'mon,  if a friend of yours mentions having a sibling that they haven't talked about before do you become somehow suspicious or something?
<p></p>So yeah,  in agreement with Perpetual Lurker.

            ^^^ Oh,  I think Trixie knows what she's doing. It's just not what she told Twilight it was.
<p></p>^^ Way,  way,  waaaaay back in middle school I happened to mention to a friend that I have an adopted little sister. She gasped and asked if my sister knew. My response: "Well,  she's Korean and the rest of us are white,  so I think she may have an inkling."
<p></p>So yeah,  I don't find it particularly out of the ordinary that Twi never happened to mention her brother before.
<p></p>Then again,  she visited Canterlot a few times before that episode. She never bothered to drop in and say hi?

            She never visited her parents on screen,  either,  and they were <em>known</em> characters at that point,  so I just chalk it up to not having enough time in episodes not even focused on Twi to begin with to show that kind of stuff.

            @Wryte: The other thing is that when you figure that Shining Armor is in the military,  Twilight might not have been able to visit him anyway; he could have been out on assignment or otherwise busy.  Heck,  the guy is on duty the day before his wedding.
