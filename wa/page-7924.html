            While AJ certainly had less focus this season compared to last,  it's only seems really bad because she actually got a <em>lot</em> of character moments in Season One,  more than any other character bar Twilight,  and even then it's close.
<p></p>I also don't think we should worry about <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a>. That takes <em>years</em> to happen. The trope namer is from one of the longest running cartoons ever,  and Loony Toons also had decades of development behind it to turn the characters into what they are today. This show has only had two seasons,  and the traits that people are worried about becoming overplayed actually don't appear in a given episode more often than not,  and when they do,  they tend to be either brought on or balanced by another important trait.

            @Lurker: True,  AJ was actually very prominant in the earliest episodes,  to the point she may have made a more developed lead than Twilight (who got a bit more rounded later on). As said,  the problem is that the show started off wowing people with it's complexities and good development. Now it's got to keep that quality going.
<p></p>I dunno though,  a few shows I've watched started to show wear and tear after only a couple of seasons. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonicSatAm" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonicSatAm">Sonic Sat Am</a> for example,  took some heavy does of Flanderization and role imbalance after only one season.

            Do you think AJ and Fluttershy would have an interesting dynamic? There'd need to be some sort of external conflict to bring out AJ's bad side though.

"slow down!"). Suppose that may work,  since work is <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> to AJ.
<p></p>Rarity also had a dynamic that bought out her more casual flaws (eg. her borrish or Tomboy traits) while still giving her some clarity.
<p></p>Personally I'd like to see more of her Rainbow Dash rivalry.

            My hopes? I hope we get to see Chrysailis and Trixe return,  especially since I remember Lauren hinting at Trixe making another appearence. I also hope we get more mane 6 episodes and less CMC episodes,  unless their like Stare Master in which the CMC's shared the episode with one of the mane 6 {This case being Fluttershy}.
<p></p>I also hope that we get less rushed episodes too.

            I'd kinda like to see another "Character gets stuck watching the CMC" episode.  I know Stare Master already did it,  but come on,  seeing Rainbow Dash or Applejack try to deal with them would be awesome.

            @Psi Then when we actually see evidence of it occurring,  that's when we should start to worry. It's when people start getting paranoid about things going wrong that they start looking for issues where there really aren't any. Just look at what happened to Dash after MMDW. If May the Best Pet Win had aired before that episode,  hardly anybody would have thought badly of it. MMDW put people on high alert for problems with RD's character,  though,  which made a lot of people bash the episode for continuing to make her a callous jerk,  when she was hardly any different than usual.

            Yeah I admit that was an inconvinient episode rotation for Rainbow Dash,  a cluster of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> episodes with all her redeeming moments mostly later on. They made up for it for the most part however.

            If I hear correctly,  and correct me if I am wrong. But Hurricane Fluttershy trounced all issues with RD this season.

            Most of her development with Fluttershy was a big redeemer for her this season and also adds a neat new chemistry. I actually think she is more benevolent now than the first season,  where she had less intense jerk moments but also less prominant kind ones.

            Oh,  dang I got that mixed up. I guess the "Rainbow Dash is a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>" calls against it were retroactive. I do distinctly remember lots of discussion on the subject,  though. Quite a few people thought her character was more or less <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuinedForever" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuinedForever">Ruined Forever</a>.
<p></p>I also maintain that MMDW's characterization problems were more with the rest of the cast than Rainbow Dash,  but that's a debate no one wants to get in to.
