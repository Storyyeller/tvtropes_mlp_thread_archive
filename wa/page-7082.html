            Not welcoming non-pony species? That totally contradicts Bridle Gossip.

            Yeah,  the Sugarcube Corner scene bugged me too.  Fluttershy's flyby didn't bug me much because that was basically solely for the purpose of obfusticating the MDW's identity rather than to humiliate her.

            I still thought that the scene in sugarcube corner was just them going "See,  Rainbow Dash? Do you like it when people do this to YOU?!"
<p></p>They were showing her that it's better to be humble because being a show off is REALLY annoying

            <div class="quoteblock">What's with all the AFID hate? Weird,  in a Ponychan poll that was one of the highest rated episodes. </div>
<p></p>AFID was just lame.  Seriously,  it was all about how cute-and-cuddly-and-please-buy-her-toy-oh-please-oh-please Pinkie Pie is,  which somehow succeeded in taking away the creepily innocent Pinkie we knew and replacing her with a shallow mascot.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">@Moe Wait,  wait,  wait. You think that Iron Will's very existence is a bad thing? Same with Gustave and Mulia? </div>
<p></p>Yeah.
<p></p>I mean,  having some random Donkey show up as a joke (like in Applebuck Season) is okay.  It's just a gag,  don't think too much about it.
<p></p>A griffon and a cow who run a competing bakery when the show makes it clear that Ponies are pretty much the dominant species just feels so wrong.  It would be like if you saw a doberman taking your order at Burger King.  I'd almost argue that the Furbobs and Bushwoolies from the 1983 series are more credible.
<p></p>I can accept Spike,  I always thought of him in the same way as Team Rocket's Meowth (IE he's not representative of his species).  Have a dragon call Celestia a "namby-pamby pony princess" and my suspension of disbelief is out the window.

            "the show makes it clear that Ponies are pretty much the dominant species"
<p></p>Pretty much wrong. Oh sure,  we make up the majority population in Ponyville,  Canterlot,  etc. but that's only a small portion of a huge world. Even here in Equestria,  there are places where griffons roam dominate.

            I don't think it's that ponies are the dominant species. I'd go with them all being about even,  but the show is My Little Pony and takes place in Equestria,  so they kind of have an obligation to focus on ponies. <br> <br>Also,  shouldn't there only be one vote for Secret of my Excess? I'm the only person who voted it. Unless I missed the other one.
