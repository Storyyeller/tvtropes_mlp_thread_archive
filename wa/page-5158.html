<p></p>I guess I've just always had a problem relating to heroes who are superior to everyone else at ANYTHING. I know you'll never understand,  but...
<p></p>Anyway,  I really liked this ep... exept for anything involving Twi's magic... but whatever <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16"> Spike is adorable <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">

            I think one of the most hilarious parts regarding shipping with this fandom is being famous for shipping absolutely everyone with everyone else. But then when the Valentine's Day episode came out the writers found the one pairing,  Cheerilee and Big Macintosh,  that nobody has shipped before.

            That would be a good lesson to learn!
<p></p>Except...it has NOTHING to do with the idea that you need someone better to learn that...In fact,  that would be a horrible way to execute that lesson.

            It'd be a complete broken aesop,  to me. Especially since someone superior would probably just make Twi MORE invested in her magic,  as she would want to learn EVERYTHING that person has to offer.

            It wouldn't work though,  because Twilight is a student first and foremost. If someone who was not like Trixie,  and thus not a braggart,  did indeed have the fire power,  Twilight would immediately want to learn everything possible. As she did when she met her future self. Her curiosity would easily squash any ego issues she had.

            Yeah... having someone superior to you be the reason why you should broaden your horizons and why you're more than a single talent seems... well,  it seems sort of like saying "You're never going to be the best,  so give up".
<p></p>Yeah,  I get that Twilight could stand to dial back on her neurosis. I get that she's too concerned with wether or not she can live up to her expectations. But that doesn't really seem like a good way to pull it off. I mean,  if the issue is her perception of how others feel,  then it's the perception,  not the reality,  that needs to be addressed. It's more of an 'Applebuck season' issue - some problem she simply can't <em>handle</em> on her own or with her magic,  to show her that no one expects her to be perfect,  and they're willing to lend a hoof. That's the issue at hand here.

<p></p>It's not about her being THE BEST it's about her being DEPENDENT on magic as a part of her identity. Let me rephrase: "Just because I am really good at something and spend a lot of time and effort and work on it,  doesn't mean I should let that things define me as a person rather then letting <em>me</em> define me as a person,  my friends don't see as only a person good at X so why should I?"

            @Pannic: Ah,  well,  I avoid creepy stuff like clopfics and pony porn. But at least it's not a very popular ship as far I know. Seen hardly any fanart. Never understood why people take something amazing and adorable as shipping and turn it into something,  well,  creepy.
<p></p>But I guess it's normal to some people since most fandoms to have that part so,  meh.

            @L Mage: Okay I'm back for one last thing: I don't know why you're focusing on Twilight when <em>every other pony in the show</em> is the same way. AJ and farming,  RD and flying,  Rarity and fashion,  etc.  That and I don't think Twilight defines herself in that way.  If she ended up never being able to do magic again,  she'd probably feel terrible about it,  but would ultimately move on to studying something else.  I don't think she's as dependent on magic as she was at the start of the series.  As a matter of fact,  the entire pilot of the series is kinda about that.
