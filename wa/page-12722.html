            This seriously might be my new favorite episode.  Dash has done a hell of a lot of growing up since early S2.  I was totally expecting her to flunk out by...well,  being Lightning Dust.
<p></p>But instead she just kicked enough ass to not only make an awesome episode,  but even more impressively,  <em>put forth the possibility of continuity actually sticking in a children's cartoon</em> by landing squarely on the Bolts' yes-list.

            Anyways it makes sense Dashie would be more of a stickler for safety. Last Season she <em>broke her wing</em> during stunt practice,  <em>and</em> she got her wing squished by a boulder in an obstacle race gone wrong. Clearly she's learnt her lessons about being reckless <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/lightbulb.png" height="16" width="16" alt="idea" title="idea">

            Speaking of background ponies,  I saw a few comments (not here) from bronies who were pissed that Derpy didn't get a cameo this episode. As much as I'd like more appearances from the wall-eyed pegasus,  I'm honestly glad she wasn't in this one. She's too much of a klutz to be in the Equestrian Air Force—if she had been shoehorned into this episode,  it would have raised all kinds of questions.

<p></p>Yeah,  that was what made it so awesome.  She <em>wasn't</em> perfect — she still had those habits,  but she stopped herself and did better without needing a moral shoved in her face first,  and would've slept just fine at night even if she didn't get rewarded for it.

            This is a random theory,  but after watching this episode,  does anyone feel that AJ and RD should have had their elements switched?
<p></p>RD is the nearest to an personified id of the group,  she's most likely to say or act how she feels,  in other words,  she has <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">Brutal Honesty</a>. This came in handy twice in the current episode,  when she immediately argues with Spitfire rather bluntly about her directions,  the first gets her ego put in check and helps her learn to cooperate with others,  while the other puts Spitfire in check and makes her realise an error in her training methods.
<p></p>AJ on the other hand is arguably the most altruistic of the group,  she often borders as <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">The Lancer</a> for Twilight and is shown to be very close knit to her family and friends. She is most frequently handy as the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a> of the group while most of her flawed moments are actually with selfless intent,  but exasperated by her overzeal (eg. her <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarBigSister" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarBigSister">Knight Templar Big Sister</a> role in Bridle Gossip,  or her immense fear of letting someone down in AS and TLR). Basically she's loyal to a fault.
<p></p>They actually seem to better represent the other's elements better than their own. As said RD is often swayed the easiest by selfish opportunities,  and while she does usually come through in the end,  her sense of loyalty doesn't come off much more exceptional from the others (it's not as if any other pony really would have failed the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrIdolDecision" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrIdolDecision">Friend or Idol Decision</a> in the pilot). Meanwhile,  the odd <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar">Bad Liar</a> joke aside,  AJ's honesty doesn't seem that defining. She's not that much more blunt than the other ponies and,  while not outright lying,  is actually often more capable of sugar coating her feelings in an approachable manner than others.

            Yeah,  while Derpy in this episode would have had plenty of opportunities for funny background events,  it would have been too weird that somepony as klutzy as her was able to make it it.  As is there were already a bunch of ponies there that made me question how strict the Wonderbolts criteria is.

            <div class="quoteblock">Derpy wouldn't have fitted except as a mailmare in the episode anyways.</div>
<p></p>I think it's pretty clear by this point that canon Derpy isn't a mailmare. Every time the show has featured a postal worker,  it's been some other pony. And all those canon mailponies wore a blue uniform,  which Derpy has yet to wear.
<p></p>Which means that,  during her cameo in "Thinking Pinkie Keen",  she was probably working for a moving company,  rather than the postal service.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">This is a random theory,  but after watching this episode,  does anyone feel that AJ and RD should have had their elements switched?</div>
No,  you're not the first. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendshipIsWitchcraft" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendshipIsWitchcraft">Friendship is Witchcraft</a></em> folks had a running gag centered on this in their episode "Dragone Baby Gone": almost of AJ and RD's dialogue is meant to sound like their elements were swapped at the very last minute of production,  and the voices were badly dubbed over to reflect the change.

Out of the mane cast she actually likely the most likely to desert her friends for selfish reasons (eg. spearheading the Flim Flam's for having cider,  until they prove to be blatant Jerkasses). Similarly AJ is honest,  but not it's not as much of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekovsGun" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekovsGun">Chekov's Gun</a> as it turned out to be for RD in this instance for example and her loyalty is more a defining drive for her personality.
