            @Lurker Celestia fascinates me <em>because</em> I don't really know anything about her,  and again,  her competence.
<p></p>Luna just... doesn't interest me as much. Oh I like her. I like her a whole lot. Luna's flaws make her... normal.
<p></p>Celestia is so perfect that she's ABNORMAL. Normal people don't act like her,  and that's interesting to me.
<p></p>See what I mean,  people never get what I say. Or they disagree with it

Luna's flaws make her human. I honestly want to know why Celestia turned out so different. Why she's like this.
<p></p>I know that if they gave Celestia an ep they would need to give her some flaws,  so given the situation as it stands now,  I'm more interested in Celestia than Luna

            Heh. Idea for a funny exchange:
<p></p>Celestia: Oh,  Luna. There you are. I was wondering where you were all day.
<p></p>Luna: Yes,  well... some of us aren't being swarmed by our adoring citizens all day long. We have to find other ways to entertain ourselves.
<p></p>Celestia: Oh goodness,  that sounds wonderful. I envy you,  Luna.
<p></p>Luna:... what.
<p></p>Celestia: I envy you! You don't have to put on a parade every time you enter a room,  you don't have to wait while sompony else brushes your teeth for you,  or preens your wings for you... nopony expects you to be perfect!
<p></p>Luna: But,  all those ponies out there... they all love you!
<p></p>Celestia: Love me? Please,  they're aristocrats. Their heads are all so far up their own bottoms they far when the talk.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Millennia of practice and isolation? Pretending to be perfect so that maybe she wouldn't realize that she wasn't,  and wouldn't have to confront her greatest failure?

            Um,  you should wait until people respond to what you say before you go into your completely unnecessary storm of self pity.
<p></p>The reason that people find Celestia less interesting is because,  by definition,  perfection <em>is</em> less interesting. What you're interested in is <em>why</em> she is perfect,  not the fact that she is perfect itself. It's a subtle distinction,  but an important one. That's why an origins episode would be my preferred way to do a Celestia. You have to tackle the "why" of her character,  because that's all there really is to tackle without going for the "hidden grief" route.
<p></p>Edit: And Ginger ninja'd me with exactly what I was saying. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            Hm...  A Celestia episode could be interesting. Kegisak has somehow captured precisely how I think any conversation between Luna and Celestia concerning the weight and responsibilities of Celestia's position vis a vis Luna's would play out.

            @Fallen: I'm a game designer by trade. Games,  as an industry,  are... weird. You tend to have very clear era's of dominant games,  because big budget games cost millions of dollars to make. In order to make that back,  you <em>need</em> to be popular,  so you have to do what's popular at the time. Which is why it seems like all the big budget games today are shooters or hack-n-slash. The next era comes along as sales start to decline and someone tries something that's new and successful. Basically,  the industry needs to pander to what's popular and basically copy each other in order to turn a profit. Smart consumers see through it,  but the stupid ones are too numerous to turn away.
<p></p>Of course soem companies find other ways of doing it. EA basically subsisted on sports games for years,  and you know how? By establishing 4 or 5 major franchises and basically re-releasing them once a year. Madden,  NHL,  SOFA,  they're basically all the same games year after year with a graphics upgrade. Cheap to make,  and your fanbase keep coming back,  year after year.
<p></p>It's cheap,  and it runs on the fact that consumers are stupid enough to keep coming back.

            The only bad thing of giving Celestia flaws is that she would perhaps ose a bit of her position as everyone's mentor. But I love the idea all the same !

            @Fallen I just wanna know what's going on beneath her royal facade. What she's really like.
<p></p>Or maybe she's like Wilson from House? He's my fav character from that show. Wilson doesn't have a true self. He's all facade. He's whoever he's with wants him to be. And exploring why Celestia is like this (if she is like this of course) interests me

            I have to disagree,  Fallen.  I don't see Celestia becoming a broken idol to anypony if any flaws she had came to light.  I'd like to think they'd actually think more of her because it demonstrates that she's not so different.

<p></p>I have to agree with you there. Now that I think it better it would remove a lot of stress ponies have when they are close to her.
