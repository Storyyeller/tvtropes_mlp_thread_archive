            What's your  next episode Star?
<p></p>Currently watching Futurama season 2 with commentary. The cast does an awesome job joking around and riffing in character which provides half an episode's worth of jokes to the episodes which makes them even more hilarious.

            @Japanese Teeth I actually worked in a school library for work experience in my other high school and before you crack any Twilight Sparkle jokes I mainly just used the library as an excuse to play Sonic Adventure and Sonic Mega Collection Plus on the laptop which those games I was given on the very first day of work experience as gifts that I got to keep. True story on that.
<p></p>@Dark What's the next episode of MLP for me? Well I've done The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 so I imagine the next episode will be the one where Rainbow Dash reads a book I believe. As for other things like the X-men animated series and Fullmetal Alchemist I'm pretty much taking my time with them but I will eventually watch them in due time of course.

            "Read It and Weep" is one of my favorite episodes,  mainly because of one sentence that mirrors my (and i'm sure others') initial reaction to the show almost to the letter (you'll know which one it is when you watch it).

<p></p>Well everyone should learn programming,  but with mathematics,  it seems like you should be able to find something already,  depending on what your skills and interests are.
<p></p>Edit: Here are some emails I got from my math department recently. The actuary one doesn't sound very promising,  but if you like finance,  you might try DE Shaw.
<p></p><hr>
<p></p>There are some financial firms where technology doesn't take a back
seat.
<p></p>Headquartered in New York City,  the D. E. Shaw group is a highly
successful investment and technology development firm with an
international reputation. Students with strong technical backgrounds are
often drawn to our approach,  which combines insights from quantitative
fields,  software development,  and finance. We offer a stimulating work
environment and colleagues from the best science and engineering
programs in the world. Our team includes Putnam Fellows,  International
Math Olympiad medalists,  patent holders,  and hundreds of people
passionate about CS,  EE,  physics,  and math.
<p></p>The work environment at the firm is incredibly stimulating and
enriching,  but surprisingly casual for the financial industry. Our
culture doesn't fit the typical corporate mold: though we’re competitive
people,  we’re not competitive with each other; you’ll see more jeans
than suits in our offices; and we value the academic environment that
allows us to continually learn from our colleagues.
Interested students should apply directly online:

to hearing from you,  and best of luck with your studies.
<p></p><hr>
<p></p>Oliver Wyman is currently recruiting for a full-time entry level actuarial consultant to start work in 2014 as well as an intern for the summer of 2014. On Thursday 9/5 we will host an information session about these opportunities. We encourage students of all levels who are interested in an actuarial career or would like to learn more about being an actuary to attend.

            There's lots of stuff you can do with math though. Industrial engineering,  finance,  cryptography,  programming,  economics,  statistics,  data analysis...
<p></p>I wouldn't go for game dev though unless you're really dedicated to it. From what I've heard,  it's not for the faint of heart,  though obviously Kegisak has more experience there.

            I know a guy who was a total maths wiz,  but only recently found work after being on the dole for 3 years after graduating. He should of been able to get something easy if math were the key but...
<p></p>I work in a supermarket,  done checkouts for almost 6 years. I'm a graduate in "New Media" which I fully admit is something of a mickey mouse degree,  but it did give me experience with a number of programs and things like video editing,  web design and graphic design.
<p></p>Annoyingly nobody in my store seems to want to trust me with any higher duties (I ask,  but never get the training to enable these things) and unfortunately the one time I did get that chance...I was incredibly overworked and I couldn't handle the workload of working the main shopfloor. Voicing that concern just saw me flung back to checkouts.
<p></p>I'm trying to learn python as a coding language and dabble with writing and art when I have free time,  also working on losing weight. So I at least have projects to preoccupy me most of the time
