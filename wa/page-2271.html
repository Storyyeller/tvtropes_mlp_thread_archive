            @Ginger: I'm not exactly the biggest Pinkie fan either. But think of it this way: Pinkie doesn't "work properly". Both her brain and her body. This means that she can do things that should be impossible but also can't relate to others in a normal way. (And there are real people who can't relate to others in a normal way. I battle with t myself.)

            Obviously,  <strong>I</strong> must be insane because I don't see how anyone can relate to her most of the time. MAYBE I can see why you'd find her <em>funny</em>,  but being funny doesn't automatically make one likeable. (ask Blueblood)
<p></p>The undercurrent of Pinkie's character,  I love. It's why the Smile song pisses me off so much. When she's lower key and less manic,  I honestly like her. When I feel warm compassion in her actions,  rather than just insanity

            @badwolfwho... Well,  yeah I might consider RD 6th best because the only 2 redeeming qualities I can think of now is I LOVE her beautiful,  shiny,  silky rainbow mane,  and she'll always be there for the ponies she loves.

            Pinkie is an interesting character.  I can only handle her in small doses,  but I think I liked her best in Luna Eclipsed and Party of One.  She was <em>more</em> than just comic relief,  although she managed to do that too in both episodes.
<p></p>She's fun.
<p></p>Can't see her being much of a babysitter,  though.  Maybe we'll get to see more of her hidden depths through this,  just as party of One highlighted her inner insecurity.  (and sad-Pinkie needs a hug.  It's the voice that does it for me,  she sounds so pitiful as the realization hits her.)

            @Ginger: I mean that they <em>don't</em> relate to her. Seriously,  you and I have rather similar opinions on her. I'm just less...extreme.

            I know I can be insufferable,  but that's because these characters mean so much to me.
<p></p>I don't usually feel a disconnect with these characters. I don't normally think of them as "fictional" So when Pinkie keeps coming along and writers force her to continuously re establish that 4th wall by making her act so cartoonishly INSANE compared to the other characters. It just rubs me the wrong way

<p></p>Ah,  but who was the one acting in blind faith in that episode? The Ponyville residents who have seen the Pinkie sense work consistently and repeatably? Or Twilight,  who was sure it was a hoax and refused to see it any other way,  in spite of it constantly working as advertised?

            It was more like her embracing the scary part of her nature,  and using the holiday as a way to get them to see who she really is under that part of her.

            I find myself in roughly the same position as Ginger on Pinkie. I don't find her as funny as other people in this fandom,  and I was always kind of annoyed at how she is less of a character and more of a. . .comedic device that the writers and animators love to throw around.
<p></p>I usually try to ignore her,  but that is typically an exercise in futility.
