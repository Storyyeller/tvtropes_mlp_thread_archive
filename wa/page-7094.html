<p></p>My specific line was "LOTR <strong>and</strong> Romance of the Three Kingdoms."
<p></p>But that reply was a knee-jerk reaction and probably should not be taken seriously.  Seraphem was basically saying I must be an uneducated idiot because I don't agree with him,  and specifically to his claim that I'm "used to being spoonfed" and can't pick up on nuances because of it.  If that were true,  a book like Three Kingdoms would be completely incomprehensible to me.

            If House of Leaves counts,  then that. If not,  off the top of my head I'd say maybe Watership Down. I don't usually remember book length very well.

            @ginger:  Yeah,  I wouldn't worry about that too much.  As long as you enjoy what you're reading it really doesn't matter how quickly you get through it.  I read pretty fast,  but I also don't retain very much.

            Really,  I'm not sure what all the focus on page count is about.  The operative thing is that the books I picked required you to be able to pick up on things that weren't explicitly spoonfed to you (which Seraphem claimed I was unable to do).
<p></p>Course,  I could've just said "Dude,  I watch anime."  But I wasn't thinking at the time.
<p></p>@ginger I'm not a fast reader either.  But remember that Slow and Steady Wins the Race.
<p></p>And speaking of race...
<p></p>@Pony Superiority
<p></p>Summary of argument:
<p></p>I,  Moe Edmond Dantes,  am stating that in my headcanon,  the world of Equestria (or country or whatever) is Pony-dominated.  The only non-pony intelligent characters are either fringe societies like the Buffalo and Diamond Dogs who clearly exist independently,  or else characters like Spike who can be taken as "not representative of their race" on what I call the Meowth Principle.
<p></p>I specifically stated I consider episodes like "Dragon Quest" and "Mystery on the Friendship Express",  among others,  discontinuity because they present elements that interfere with this idea.
