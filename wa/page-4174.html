            @Seraph perhaps both. Iron Will almost goes nuts because of his inability to get to Fluttershy,  then he ultimately tries some drastic new technique on her out of desperation that works too well

            AWWWW!!! at Twilight and Smarty Pants going to school together!  That looks like something I would have wanted to do with my Bug dolls when I was little!  The Bug dolls are,  well,  Raid promotional dolls that I was given when I was 3 or so and I turned them into some of the very first characters I ever created.  I still like the old stories I made up about them,  and I even included Sim versions of them in the Sims 3,  since that game allows one to make Sims with things like green skin.
<p></p>It's interesting to see what my most common words are.  I suspect some of that is because bullying IS probably my <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>,  so I have at least a few rants about it on here.

Sure. I'm hoping this show is still unpredictable enough that they find a way to avoid the "goes way too far" act.

            Nonono,  Sky,   I can understand what you're saying.  My main complaint is the way you phrased the moral made it seem as if it is impossible to be assertive without being a jerk.

            I'd kind of like it if orignally Fluttershy became assertive,  then became too assertive and learned to balance it.
