            I think the big question everyone's asking is when do we finally get a Derpy episode?<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_grin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="grin" title="grin">
<p></p>osais: I think it's more the fact they made her competent in a method of striping her of some of her flaws and bumbling moments that were meant to keep her an equal to the other two,  not to mention they downgraded another equally popular character to befit it.
<p></p>For example the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PositiveDiscrimination" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PositiveDiscrimination">Positive Discrimination</a> page discusses a instance in the first book where she saves Ron,  in the book she has something of an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a> and has a panic attack before he calms her down so she can perform the spell. In the movie she just nonchalently does the whole thing with ease while Ron makes an ass of himself. Both have her act heroic,  but in the book she is more sympathetic and fallible in execution.

Yes,  the Simpsons should play themselves on My Little Pony!  Or Bart could just play a whole lot of ponies.

            The POA movie was missing a good part of Snape's character development,  in my opinion.  Unless Im getting books mixed up Harry's father and his friends lured Snape near Lupin when he was a werewolf and almost got him killed,  one of the many reasons Snape is hard on Harry.
<p></p>Snape is painted as such a jerk,  and Harry's dad a paragon... yet Harry's father was a real jerk to Snape.  Sure it was wrong for Snape to take it out on the guy's kid... but I can see why.

<p></p>And given how much crap happened last time they gave Derpy the spotlight,  I can't see them trying it again.  They'll probably leave her in as a cameo,  but I don't think she'll ever get a focus episode.

<p></p>Even if you ignore the fact that they mangled the plot beyond comprehension to anyone who hasn't read the books,  and you ignore the stupid stuff like the talking heads and Mexican Hairless Werewolf,  as well as shortcuts taken due to dramatic conventions,  there are still tons of contradictions that scream <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyJustDidntCare" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyJustDidntCare">They Just Didn't Care</a>.
<p></p>Here are a couple off the top of my head
<ul><li> Invisible Harry doesn't leave footprints during the attack on Malfoy,  but he does in every other scene.
</li><li> They added human footprints on the Maruders map even though it doesn't make any sense,  since one of the characters is a rat.
</li><li> The werewolf looks more like something out of Neopets than an actual wolf,  which contradicts the scene where Snape asks Hermoine how to tell wolves and werewolves apart,  implying it's not something any two year old could do.

            I do think the third one was the best,  and it was what made me want to read the series,  but the issue was WHY it made me want to,  it was the first film where I could just tell without even having heard a book synopsis or anything that they left out a lot of details from the book.
<p></p>as to film v book,  the issue is they are completely different media and trying to turn something made for one to fit another always alters it enough that some will hate it.

            I like Derpy a fair bit,  but I wouldn't make her a main character or anything - maybe a gag episode about a day in the life of Derpy,  but to be honest - I think the fuss kicked up about the one time she got to talk killed any chance of Derpy getting a starring role any time soon. She's better off as a mostly-fanon pony with random cameos
<p></p>I mean I won't say no to an episode like that,  but I think I'ld be worried about the whole "disability" argument starting up again,  and I'd hate to lose Derpy completely,  simply because people can't handle her being more than a once-per-episode gag :/

            Wow,  so much hate thrown around today. The weirdest thing is that I just saw one person denounce the Watchmen movie for "slavishly following the comic" and then another for changing it too much from the comic within the span of five minutes.
<p></p>Book adaptations are almost always different,  simply because of medium restrictions. The best ones are the ones that aren't afraid to go ahead and change the plot where necessary while keeping the characters and themes consistent,  because what makes a good book is not what makes a good movie.
