When I was working on my senior paper,  there were a few classes that honestly weren't going to impact my grade in a notable fashion,  so if I knew I didn't have a test or anything,  I just wouldn't bother.  Granted you can't overdo it,  but sometimes it's just not worth the trouble.

            Bad idea.
<p></p>Skipping class gets you in big trouble.  Better to go to class and do nothing but stare at the wall; because that,  at least,  won't get people all after you.
<p></p>Better to do poorly on an assignment than to not turn it in and get a zero.
<p></p>Do your homework from other classes in the class you want to skip; that works a lot better; but skipping class does no good.
<p></p>I mean sure,  if you can't do the work and it's not worth that much,  maybe you can just not do it; but show up to class,  if only to avoid the trouble that follows skipping class.

<p></p>It's different in college. for most classes,  noone cares if you skip or not,  but it's still a bad idea IMO. I make an effort to go to every class,  though I usually don't pay attention.

            There's still no benefit to skipping class as opposed to being physically present and doing something else/doing nothing.

            They don't care of I appear or not.  But if I go there,  I'll only make an eejit of myself.  I'll skip this class,  then work really really hard for the last three.

            @ATC: When I was in college at least,  there were actually a number of skips built into most classes before you ever started getting points off.  Sure,  you don't want to miss classes where important stuff is happening,  but if it's just a lecture most profs don't care so long as you get the notes from somebody else.
<p></p>And yes,  there can definitely be benefits to skipping; if you have an assignment in a more important class it's usually better to skip a lecture to finish it up rather than miff the assignment to show up and not pay attention,  since college classes generally put a lot more weight on papers and exams.  I've even known people who skipped over half the class sessions and still got good grades because they showed up for tests and did all the course work.
<p></p>It's good to make it to as many classes as you can,  of course,  but it's usually better to prioritize getting papers and stuff done over showing up for class.  Still,  it probably won't get you in trouble unless you <em>never</em> show up.

<p></p>I prefer to avoid cooking complicated stuff like meat. The hardest thing I've cooked regularly is chocolate chip pancakes.

            Pan-cooking meat is a pain,  but as long as it's just a "put it in the oven and leave it" I can handle it.  The main reason I don't actually cook more is because clean up is a huge pain.

            Teeth: I think that's a lesson most college students need to end up learning sooner or later. I know I had to do the same on several occasions.
<p></p>Story: It's bad to skip if one is just making an excuse to be lazy,  but if there are higher priorities (like absolutely needing that extra 75 minutes to work on a paper or project that's worth 40% of the class grade,  for instance),  then sometimes sacrifices need to be made. I know I'd rather miss out on a lecture where catching up later on my own might cause me to miss out on a mark or two from obscure stuff,  as opposed to possibly not meeting the deadline on a major assignment.
<p></p>EDIT: Ninjaed.
<p></p>Also,  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> That's precisely why I'm adverse to cooking too. I enjoy the part where I figure out how to make good food,  but I can't be bothered to deal with a billion dirty dishes.

            Eh,  there's only a few subjects in my case where showing up is mandatory. They don't even care if you're in a class with another teacher,  which results in the better teachers getting swamped and the not-so-good ones getting empty classrooms. I tend not to skip them,  tho'. My studying habits are horrid,  and I'm pretty punctual with my projects,  with,  combined with the first problem,  let me have enough time to finish them.

            Really? I honestly find cooking meat to be really simple because you can do it by eye(And mouth!)
<p></p>Most cooking is honestly pretty simple. The basics,  at least. It's once you wanna get fancy that things get complicated. Before that... just follow recipes,  honestly. MY parents made a cookbook for me before I moved out. Good stuff in there... even if I only ever used the Meatloaf recipe more than once.
