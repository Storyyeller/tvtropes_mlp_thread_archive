            You know how we always imagined Twilight as some kind of grad student?
<p></p>Does becoming a princess mean she's earned her PhD in Friendshipology?

            Damn on one hand, it felt like it just happened so quick, ...on the other it felt epic
<p></p>Shining Armor definitely had the best line
<p></p>But the rest of the final act was kinda, ....sappy.
<p></p>I'll rewatch it again, and then I'll give it the final verdict, ...but for now it seems to be the best episode since "Too Many Pinkie Pies" and the <em>fourth</em> A+ episode written by MA Larson.
<p></p>A little disappointed that it ended with Twilight already flying though.
<p></p>But even if I do find more gaping problems, ....it's still better than the last finale or The Grand Galloping Gala.

            I'm still curious about exactly why Star Swirl was researching a spell that could create alicorns.  Maybe he didn't realize that the elements were required to work.

            That's the major thing that bothered me.  Even if it was boosted by the Elements,  it was still a two-line spell that cost apparently no effort to cast and didn't even require Twilight to be wearing her Element (which every other effect,  including petrification and purification,  as well as the magic resistance the Elements grant,  requires).

            Apparently,  Twilight is the Alicorn of Friendship.
<p></p>Since Star Swirl didn't get that,  and cause this whole show is about how Friendship Is Magic,  it was necessary for the Alicorn-candidate to realize/use/literally become the avatar of friendship.

            Maybe Star Swirl was just very efficient. Or the spell uses the power inherent in the elements and the "spell" Twilight cast was just like an activation phrase or something.

            A spell to <em>change a pony's inner nature</em> causes Twlight less exertion than those she used to give her friend butterfly wings,  carry a bottle of milk to an Ursa Minor,  or even <em>teleport</em>?
<p></p>And there weren't any plot holes,  whoever said anything about plot holes? I didn't. I said the plot was <em>stupid</em>,  not that it was <em>defective</em>. Plenty of stupid things in the world that <em>function</em> fine,  it's just that the job they so serviceably <em>do</em> is <em>not worth doing</em>.
<p></p>I can't shake the feeling that the entire point of this was to sell a new toy,  and the creative team got stuck trying to wring a decent story to justify it. It bears the same dumbass,  "show is being Out Of Character" feeling as the arcs involving Cadence. Which they still pulled off <em>magnificently</em>,  but were could not escape <em>this</em> reaction:
<p></p><center><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="425" height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NpYEJx7PkWE?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p></p>In other words,  it's fine as long as you don't think about it <em>too</em> hard.
<p></p>Also,  it fucks up a lot of fanfic canons which presumed that hacking magical code was perfectly normal for a Unicorn and Twilight just happened to be exceptionally good at it.

            Really,  it didn't even look like Twilight was casting the spell.  First time I saw the scene I just thought she was reading it aloud to herself and the elements responded for some reason.

            I know I wasn't the only one who was pretty surprised at the ending. I think this episode would have for better as a two-part series finale.

            Liked the episode. Probably should've been a two-parter. Main conflict was resolved halfway through and the rest was just "yup,  princess."
<p></p>But I'm not complaining,  because we got a lot of nice musical numbers,  Derpy is back,  and my favorite ship made another appearance.

That's the major thing that bothered me. Even if it was boosted by the Elements,  it was still a two-line spell that cost apparently no effort to cast and didn't even require Twilight to be wearing her Element (which every other effect,  including petrification and purification,  as well as the magic resistance the Elements grant,  requires). </div>
<p></p><span class="blue">None of the spells in this show ever require any effort.  They either work,  and wrap up the plot in whatever way is necessary,  or they fail because it's too early for the plot to be resolved.</span>

            I did rather like most of the music in this episode.  Other than Babs Seed I hadn't been liking the music this season as much as previous seasons,  but this episode made up for that a bit.

            I'm not complaining either,  but I'm pretty worried about how the show will turn out. I loved the musical numbers and the plots,  but I <em>did</em> find it scary how the animals attempted to <em>cook and eat</em> Rainbow Dash. I just hope things won't change for the worst.
<p></p>Will Twilight still be able to interact with the other ponies? Will the Cutie Mark Crusaders <em>ever</em> get their cutie marks? <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">Why am I asking all of these questions?</a>

            @Blue: She shows some effort in some cases,  like Boast Busters,  but yeah,  for the most part,  spells seem to be a matter of skill rather than effort.
