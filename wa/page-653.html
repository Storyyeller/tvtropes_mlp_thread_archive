<p></p>Depends on how willing they are to have continuity.  In season one they wanted the episodes to be viewable in any order.  If that is still the case,  its unlikely they'll want the crusaders to have cutie marks in some episodes but not others.  But I'm hoping they're relaxing that a bit,  so its possible.

            I love CMC ,  and whant to see more episodes with them,  even after they got their CM.
<p></p>But giving one of them CM only is terible idea. If one get CM she will explain to the rest how to get theirs and they will it quicky. If this will cause drama I call BS.

            ^Twist would have had her cutie mark for months by any time they could bring her back.  There's no way they could believably say "okay,  it's been five months since Twist got her mark and Applebloom didn't; now it's suddenly a problem!"

            I have a question,  DC. You don't seem to have a problem with Twist stirring up drama about being abandoned after she got her cutie mark. What's the difference if it happens to,  say,  Scootaloo? Or Sweetie Belle?

            I think if one of them gets their cutie mark,  it should be a massive deal,  and the crusader who got it SHOULDN´T know how they obtained it (or even what the mark represents).
<p></p>Or what about an episode where a villain (Discord perhaps) gives one of the CMC a fake mark just to drive them apart?

            By this point,  I'd just love watching them get a Cutie Mark to just end their story arc,  even if it IS only one of them.  In fact,  one would be best,  because it <em>would</em> cause drama for the other two and would actually give them an <em>interesting episode</em> for once.

I know you explained it earlier,  but I couldn´t quite understand it.
<p></p>Twilight tried to give AB a cutie mark. She´s not the strongest BEING in Equestria I don´t think. I bet something that uses evil,  more powerful magic could brand the CMC with an evil Cutie Mark

That would be huge flanderisation or simply character derailment for them if they don't get it .

How you get your mark differs from pony to pony too,  so what worked for AB might not work for SB if you understand what I´m saying.
<p></p>Giving one of them their mark first would be a great way to show that all 3 of them are genuine friends,  and their not together simply to look for their cutie marks
<p></p>I´m just speculating about Discord. Also,  Twilight was trying to create a true Cutie mark,  I was thinking that discord would just create a fake one

            But they could listen each other.  Key problem what CMC have that they not understand that they need something what they are good in it and enjoy doing it. If AB understand that she like fixing thing and making them look prety she would they SB that she like singing and song writing and she is good in it.
<p></p>It's good idea for final scene of CMC Arc but not for some episode long drama.
<p></p>Showing that they are real friends not just because their quest is good idea for story after crusading is over.
