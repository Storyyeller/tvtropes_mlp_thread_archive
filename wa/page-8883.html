            @Bad Alright,  we need to stop arguing about this. You don't like the story changes,  and feel that the books are worthless if they're not canon. That's fine. I'm not going to stop you. Just don't say that the game was bad because of that,  because your complaints have nothing to do with the game itself,  or the continuity between the games themselves.

            I believe it refers to a comedy where the wacky happenings come about by people being dumb and making mistakes. Now I go to Wikipedia to see if my guess is right...

            pretty much what it sounds like. the comedy is derived from things fucking up spectaculalry; usually in a situation where things wouldn't have been half so bad if the characters themselves hadn't felt the need to over-complicate it.

            <div class="quoteblock">The Comedy of Errors is one of William Shakespeare's earliest plays. It is his shortest and one of his most farcical comedies,  with a major part of the humour coming from slapstick and mistaken identity,  in addition to puns and word play. The Comedy of Errors (along with The Tempest) is one of only two of Shakespeare's plays to observe the classical unities. It has been adapted for opera,  stage,  screen and musical theatre.
<p></p>The Comedy of Errors tells the story of two sets of identical twins that were accidentally separated at birth. Antipholus of Syracuse and his servant,  Dromio of Syracuse,  arrive in Ephesus,  which turns out to be the home of their twin brothers,  Antipholus of Ephesus and his servant,  Dromio of Ephesus. When the Syracusans encounter the friends and families of their twins,  a series of wild mishaps based on mistaken identities lead to wrongful beatings,  a near-seduction,  the arrest of Antipholus of Ephesus,  and false accusations of infidelity,  theft,  madness,  and demonic possession.</div>
<p></p>@ Lurker: It has to do with the plot of the game. Which happens to be one of the major things I play games for.

            It also seems to be used very loosely as "oh man,  this is just one long chain of (people/things) screwing up."
<p></p>And that's an interesting LP you've started. Kind of feel really sorry for the group doing it,  after a while.
<p></p>Which is why I like their Sonic Colors LP. They <em>like</em> that game.

            They were pretty positive on the Sonic Generation LP too!
<p></p>Unfortunately their Sonic Generations LP (Not including the skill stuff) wasn't very interesting to watch. Their skill run of Sonic Generations on the other hand is pure Speed Running Ambrosia.

            Very true. And there are hilarious bits,  too. Like that time when they went through Silver's jungle stage almost entirely <em>backwards</em>. Completely by accident. But that's what happens when you combine <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreakingHavok" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreakingHavok">Wreaking Havok</a> with level design that clearly didn't think too hard about what could be done.
<p></p>But I did really like their Colors run because after the hilarious hatred of the 06 run,  it was nice to see them actually <em>like</em> a game where they aren't plagued by Time Dimensions or Werewolf Jazz.
<p></p>...plus,  I felt vindicated to know that they enjoyed Colors. I love Colors.

            @Bad The plot is internally consistent,  and consistent with the things that are officially considered canon with it. You can't blame the game for retconing things that were quite clearly stated to only be canon unless a game changed them. And those stories were still quality stories. You enjoyed reading them. That didn't disappear just because parts of them aren't canon. Forget about it,  though. That's your opinion on the game,  and that's fine. I'll drop it if you will.
