            Canada is similar. There's,  to my knowledge,  only one real long range passenger train: The Canada Pacific Railway,  which goes through all of Canada(And apparently accounts for a large amount of the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleRich" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleRich">Idle Rich</a> in Manitoba - yes,  we literally have railway tycoons). I've heard the Toronto metro also goes to some cities outside toronto as well,  but I think it probably only goes to the greater toronto area cities.
<p></p>Most cross-Canada tripping is done by busses. IS there any way for you to get a bus ticket,  Seraph?

I wish that were the case where I am. Lining up to buy a ticket can take a horrendous amount of time,  and the trains are always packed tighter than a can of sardines.
<p></p>Also,  people have no sense of etiquette. Imagine having to <em>push</em> your way out of the train because everyone is rushing to get in. (Not always,  but a common phenomenon in certain stations where a lot of people are coming and going.)

<p></p>I get that,   but there is a good reason for RD to be there. Once you've caught up,   you should be able to see that and your problems miight be mitigated  bit.
<p></p>Also,   RD hasn't Rainboomed once since she woke up (she's gone over mach 4 twice,   but hasn't quite crossed Rainboom speeds yet. Umbra doesn't think she can anymore.),   she was tapping her Talent when she learned Solar and one of the rules of the setting is "talents always win",   so that's not exclusive to her (it's also why she doesn't stand a chance in a one-on-one with Charisma),   she wasn't wondering casually in the Everstorm. She was suffering from magic overdose and was in danger of insanity and overhealing same as the others. Remember that overhealing is very dangerous in this setting. And the only change to The Maul was  using bigger missiles for the final shot,   which she defeted via sonic boom,   something which some other pegasi are also capable of.
<p></p>And yeah,   the idea is that Rainbow is basically as if we suddenly dug up Heracles or Gilgamesh or Samson or Achiles or someone like that and they were just as powerful as their legends said they were.

            @kyler: Clearly such campaigns are aimed at plebeian ponies,  certainly they aren't refering to them.
<p></p>Though I doubt Celestia has done anything of that sort,  she probably just lets them do what they want in Canterlot since at least they won't be screwing things up in the rest of Equestria.

No wonder the Changelings targeted it first rather than aim at the city of Manehatten.
