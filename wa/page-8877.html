            Keg: Francis kind of a medium combination of Nick and Ellis.  Some random absurd stuff and some snarking.  Ellis just takes strange and turns it up to eleven.  His Keith story that can play in The Passing's final safe room is especially strange and hilarious.
<p></p>Dalek: Neither,  have I.
<p></p>Swas: You don't need a mic to contribute to the team.  Sharp eyes,  ears and anticipation (being able to dodge Tank rocks while in the open is a big one) are the big things.  Heck,  I've played expert realism games where we all hardly said a word and just worked so well together that we totally embarrassed the campaign.

            The only problem I have with the fable games is that it was too easy,  even the first one which you could actually die on was easy with the restoration potions.

Didn't really take those into account. The top looks vaguely Maid-ish,  too. Yeah,  it's probably a made up class. <br> <br><div class="quoteblock">Heck,  I've played expert realism games where we all hardly said a word and just worked so well together that we totally embarrassed the campaign.</div>
I'm not really good enough to do anything like realism. Nice teamwork there,  though. <br> <br>I've never touched a Fable game. They all look pretty eh to me.

            I'll be all over Black/White 2 when it comes out. I still love those games,  and the fact that they're ramping up the plot with a full-on sequel game is just awesome. Also,  there's this,  which is also awesome and needs to replace the current Pokemon anime,  even though it won't: <center><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="425" height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/e2SA4GyXb2U?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
