            So I just watched Episode 2,  and that was pretty epic. I'm disappointed that Discord didn't have a song,  Luna didn't show up,  and the rock was Tom,  not Dan. But when Discord said "back where you began, " how does that even relate to Twilight's house? Did he mean where she began this morning? That could apply to Sweet Apple Acres. And a better one would have been the old castle,  because he was referring to the Elements,  not the ponies.

I took it to mean Ponyville itself,  since that's where Twilight's adventures in friendship began.  After she realized that,  she figured that once they got there,  she could go to the library and look up the Elements of Harmony for more ideas.

<p></p>Anyway,  onto the Nega-Ponies. Applie Jack was good once she got a poker face,  but most of the time she was just being sarcastic. Greedity didn't seem that far out of character,  but Rarity has uber mood swings all the time. Flutterbitch was by far the most awesome one. Traitor Dash wasn't un-loyal,  just too loyal to the wrong things. The only one I have a problem with is Meanie Pie. The way Discord corrupted her,  she should've been Paranoia Pie,  afraid of everyone laughing at her. But then she got pre-emptive and became a second Flutterbitch.

            My problem was that Discord had clearly done something else to Applejack other than just making her lie.
<p></p>Under his influence She lies all the time,  fair enough,  but why was she acting malevolently towards Twilight? You can lie to someone an still like them. In fact that was supposedly WHY she was lying in the first place,  to protect their friendship.

At the start,  Pinkie was more paranoid at being laughed at than mean,  and Applejack's early lies were more in the spirit of protecting their friendship. It was about the time they entered the library that seemed to be the turning point.

            On the subject of Nega-ponies,  what was up with grey Twilight? I assume that's just cartoon shorthand for sad,  but because other ponies are grey for other reasons,  I wasn't sure.
<p></p>And we see Nega Granny Smith and Big Mac,  but none of the other background ponies. Was this just because it was later in the episode and Discord's influence was more powerful-er?

            Yeah,  Twilight didn't look like she was mentally affected by Discord. As in she wasn't acting like a jerk. I guess they just needed to illustrate that at that point,  Discord had won.

            ^I'm pretty sure the grey was intended to show that Twilight had given up on both her friendship and on defeating Discord.  That's why she threw away the Crown of Magic when she got home,  and why she got her color back when she read the friendship reports.
<p></p>And yes,  I did notice flying Scootaloo.  Of course,  I guarantee that'll be extrapolated into incontestable proof that Scootaloo will never be able to fly normally or some nonsense like that...
