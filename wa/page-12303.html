            Well,  I have to say that "One Bad Apple" was a lot better than I thought. I was so sure that it was going to be a train wreck!

<p></p>Yeah,  Scootaloo is definitely standing out more. Let me tell you that the sight of Sweetie Belle crying is something I never want to see again! &lt;Afraid&gt; That has to be the first time I have ever seen Sweetie Belle's house,  and her father Magnum made a cameo appearance.

<p></p>I still don't think that's the best voice they could've given her. It seems to low for a kid,  and the accent is grating.  But maybe it's one of those girls who had a particularly deep voice.
<p></p>I love the snappiness of the animation this episode!  It's faster and more entertaining than usual.

            Just watched the episode. It was entertaining,  but I am not terribly pleased with the underlying message that fighting back bullies (although in an admittedly harebrained way) is the same thing as <em>being</em> a bully. I mean,  sure,  the proper action would have been to tell Applejack; but there is a difference,  I think,  between harassing other people in order to maintain a desirable social status and defending oneself from harassers.

            @Car They weren't defending themselves. They were setting a trap for the sole purpose of humiliating her in front of the entire town. That <em>is</em> bullying.

            Okay,  finally got around to watching the whole episode.  Overall I think it's pretty good,  if a bit compressed.  I really liked how they hinted at Babs' self-confidence issues,  it made a lot of her behavior more tolerable and it let them tackle the subject from multiple angles. I also like the way that they showed that asking an adult could help,  but it wasn't what solved the issue.  They also handled the Cycle of Abuse aspect of it pretty well.
<p></p>That said,  some of the pacing seemed a bit off.  Babs goes from being nervous and almost shy to being a total jerk <em>really</em> fast,  and there were a couple of jump cuts in there that seemed a bit disconnected.  Like the song,  while I think it's probably the best one in the season so far,  comes out of freaking nowhere,  and the whole A-team plot seemed really rushed (it would have helped if they had worked on it for a day or two ahead of time rather than thinking of it and then putting it together right away).  I also would have liked to see DT and SS get addressed a bit more.
<p></p>But for the most part,  I thought it was pretty good.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Yeah,  their goal there was explicitly revenge; they wanted to get her back for the crap she did to them and do so in a really mean way.  Defending themselves would be if they had tried to take back the clubhouse,  or attempted to physically prevent her from stealing their milkshakes or something.  They wanted to embarrass and humiliate her to make themselves feel better,  which is pretty much what bullying is.

            Good episode. Probably one of my favourite CMC episodes. My only major criticism is that Babs' voice was......an odd choice.
<p></p>Best line: "Lettuce in!"
<p></p>I like how the CMC are more mature than Pinkie.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
