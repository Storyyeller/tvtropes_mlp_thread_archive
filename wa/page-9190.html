            The anime got too formulaic,  Ash meets generic character and either befriends or antagonises them,  Team Rocket invade and get thrashed,  Ash leaves to new place and starts over. Add in the odd tournament which got old after the Kanto gyms.
<p></p>It also suffered villain/hero dynamics that almost make me rage as much as ginger,  the heroes got blander and goody goody in favor of making the villains more loveable and sympathetic,  as a result it became harder to root for the hero side and at times they even came off as bullies against them due to trying to make them so damn pitiful. I heard new episodes made Team Rocket more competent but haven't seen it to know how well the dynamic works.
<p></p>Is Meowth still a crappy battler?

Along with Ash being an idiot that was mentioned earlier it almost sounds like going the opposite extreme.

            @Chad Ghetsis is the <em>best</em> kind of prick,  though. The kind that fools everyone,  then proceeds to kick my ass in ways that not even the legendary pokemon that the decoy villain was using could,  only losing to me because I had more items than him (though he did have a <em>lot</em> of items).

Can I just say I never thought I'd see someone recommend either of these? Bonus points for good game taste. <br> <br>When I was younger,  I always found Team Rocket annoying. Almost every time they appeared,  I just wanted them to go away. <br> <br>I can't even remember much about Ghetsis. I remember beating him pretty easily,  though.

            Chadaman: Did Ash's bumbling make him more likeable at least? If they phased out the sympathetic villains,  they may as well have a sympathetic hero.

            Jessie was the lesser Sympathetic members of team Rocket. You could care for her plights but she was still a mean hag deep down. James was sweet,  bumbling,  a little inept but had a heart filled with love.

<p></p>@Chadaman,  How... disappointing...

            While I'm on a pokemon roll,  this music needed to be in the game proper. Unfortunately,  it's only set to play for the official real life World Chamionships.

            I liked James,  especially when he bought the Magikarp in that one episode then was all bummed out and was looking for the guy to get his money back.  I think the voice actor really got into playing him too which helped a ton.

            I remember liking Meowth a lot,  a crafty <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaffyDuck" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaffyDuck">Daffy Duck</a> esque schemer with lots of pitiful shades. I remember hating he was a terrible fighter,  even by the team's usual standards. He rarely even got in a hit in battles,  to the point his opponents looked outright sadistic in thrashing him.
<p></p>Did anyone else really want a <em>real</em> Pikachu vs Meowth battle in the anime? ie. one that lasted for longer than one move.
