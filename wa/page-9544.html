            Pinkie's fave fruit would be something sweet. Maybe strawberries for dipping them in chocolate and the colour.
<p></p>My fave fanon? Hard to decide. Maybe the Ask the Pie Sisters version of Pinkie's family (I used in my fanfic due to how much I liked it after all).
<p></p>Least fave? Er...maybe Scootabuse?
<p></p>Also,  it's canon that Cadance buffed Shining. It was <em>his</em> spell that sent the Changelings flying.

            My favorite Cupcake alt ending was the one where it was a nightmare pinkie had,  causing her to wake up screaming while dash was nearby,  and dash spent the whole night talking her down and calming her.

            I also like the fanon of Octavia being one of Pinkie Pie's sisters too. Along with the fanon idea of Dinky and Sparkler being Derpy's daughters/step daughters.

            I admit AJ gets the short end of the straw in terms of spotlight,  even her family usurped it from her more in season two. She only got one to herself in Season One as well,  but to compensate she got loads of duo episodes with others,  counting those she may have the most starring roles outside Twilight early on.
<p></p>If Rogers writes for Season Three,  it's a shoe in,  nearly all her episodes are AJ ones.
<p></p>This ones hard to describe,  but I'd kinda like an episode that subverts RD's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">Leeroy Jenkins</a> role. I think it's of the few facets they haven't show a different angle on with the mane cast. like an episode the team think she is just rushing into things and hold her down while they try to heavily tactise a problem,  before she shows she knows exactly what she's doing (maybe because she listened to the others about her previous recklessness as a good two way moral).
<p></p>Smaller ideas; a previous villain returning and maybe finally getting a Big Mac episode like was planned.

            Octavia is a different colour from Pinkie's sister. They're not the same. <br>Don't mind me,  just ruining fun. <br> <br>I'm not sure if I could pick favorite fanons,  but I really dislike Molestia. Trollestia is slightly better,  but not by much.

            I'm less fond of involving the Doctor in the Derpy family,  because I tend to think of that family existing within the show,  and having a crossover character in the mix just makes things weird.

            I suppose we can give credit that while AJ got the least amount of solo episodes,  she at least got the first more or less,  Applebuck Season is rather firmly focused on her and arguably gave the most character establishment to anyone after Twilight.

            I prefer Octavia as Pinkie's cousin personally.
<p></p>Also,  yeah,  we need more AJ and Big Mac!
<p></p>As for Dinky,  I'm not particularly attached to her being Derpy's daughter,  but I do kind of like the four member Hooves family which naturally includes that.
<p></p>I do like Lyra's human obsession,  but I prefer it when it's subverted a bit and I like Lyra far <em>more</em> for how emotional and excitable she is.
<p></p>EDIT: Yeah,  I prefer it when Doctor Whooves isn't <em>THE</em> Doctor. However,  time travel is available in Equestria.

            In terms of Octavia,  I believe that she would either be the hotblooded,  impulsive type (I like bait-and-switches) or totally silent.
<p></p>Also,  Nickelodeon's Victorious is playing in the background,  and a character said "Looks like Granny Smith broke her hip" after a Granny Smith apple was thrown on the ground.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">

            Yeah,  my version of  Doctor Whooves isn't meant to be The Doctor. He doesn't have a TARDIS,  after all,  he can perform most of its functions himself. He's not an alien. Has one heart. Can't regenerate. Was born a completely ordinary pony. It's just that like <em>every other</em> pony with an hourglass cutie mark. His special talent is time travel (He's the best though). As for how he earned such a cutie mark,  that'll be revealed in my fanfic.

            Overall,  I'm not really a fan of Doctor Whooves being basically a Doctor in Equestria. The only version I've ever really liked was the one in CEQ. <br> <br>Sereg,  I've never actually read it. Is your fic the one where all cutie marks have specific meanings? <br>Seems kind of weird for something like time travel as an ability to be so common. <br> <br><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">what?

            So,  are you like just a general practitioner,  or do you have a specialty?  You are an M.D.,  right?  Or do you just have a Ph.D in quantum physics or something?
