            I want to watch <em>Wreck It Ralph</em>,  but I only have so much money to spend on movies and there's so much else I want to watch. I really should,  though. Maybe just bite the bullet and watch it in one of the cheap theatres.
<p></p>Snow has started in earnest here. Most locations in the area are closed or on a delay,  though I <em>really</em> don't understand the point of delay,  given that the snow and ice are supposed to <em>intensify</em> throughout the morning. But who can understand why government agencies do what they do? Someday,  somebody who has to go to work or to school while all this stuff is happening is going to get seriously hurt or killed,  and then they're going to think twice when they get hit with a lawsuit. Not something that I <em>want</em> to happen,  but it almost seems inevitable.

            Agreed. It's just that it's so ridiculous because this is like a constant thing around this area. There don't seem to be any set standards as to how they make this decision,  as in "if X,  Y,  or Z are true,  then we delay" or "if we see X and Y,  then we close things up." It's like they just find the nearest roulette wheel. "Come on,  come on,  come on,  beep beep beep beep... delayed!!!!!"

            <strong>Ace</strong>,  the places I'm talking about aren't datacenters or hospitals. I'm talking about <em>schools</em> and <em>libraries</em> that are choosing to remain open during this. These are places that can close and <em>are</em> choosing to close in many areas,  but for some unfathomable reason,  others are choosing to remain open.

            I <em>work</em> at one of said libraries,  and if by some bizarre chance anyone from the local area is reading,  I am telling you— <em>stay home</em>! There is nothing you need at our library so badly to go out in this that it can't wait until tomorrow. Stay safe.

            Yeah,  being alive is kind of a prerequisite to being educated. (And to a lesser extent,  being unharmed.)

            If I had to drive,  I'd seriously consider just skivving off. As it is,  it's about a five minute walk,  so I'll go myself (walking very carefully),  but I just don't see why they would encourage others to go out in this weather.
<p></p>That's assuming they don't just come to their senses and cancel. They still have about three and half hours to make that decision,  with the current delay in effect.

            Not to our libraries,  heh. They're ten cents a day,  and none at all on juvenile print items. And I bet if people called and asked them to waive if they weren't able to make it in today,  they would.
<p></p>Honestly,  I think this thing caught them by surprise. They looked at the radar last night,  saw that it looked far to the south and thought it wasn't going to be a big deal,  despite the warnings on the news that this was coming.

            Maybe the owner doesn't really believe the weather reports. I've heard of that happening with tropical storms (one relative married a Cuban immigrant,  and the immigrant's aunts thought the weather reporter was lying because she'd left Cuba after a certain year,  and was therefore a communist,  so she had to be lying),  so it isn't something unheard of.

            Perhaps so. Like I said,  this seems to be a constant issue in the local area. No standards,  no rules,  no sense regarding such decisions. But I'm just repeating myself,  so I'll move on.
<p></p>So... next episode. We haven't really seen much of Spike this season,  have we? I kinda like the little guy,  so I'm curious to see what will happen with him in this one.
