            One wonders what Luna does these days? If the fandom is to be believed she just walks around yelling at ponies.

            @Ginger:  I don't think anyone is saying that Luna is not at fault,  just that something else took advantage of the situation.  If I'm pissed off at someone and some shady guy eggs me on to shoot him,  I'm still the one at fault.  Luna could have been steaming on her own,  evil force is all "hey,  how bout you don't lower the moon, " and she goes along with it.  It was still her choice.

            Ginger,  regardless of whatever tangled mess That is your mind leads to the conclusions you come To where black and white equals black and white instead of grey,  Luna making a choice when offered or nudged by whatever potential outside force that could've changed her still makes it her own danged fault because she made perfectly conscious decisions based on her emotional state and continued to act upon them even when opposed.
<p></p>I mean the difference between Nightmare Moon and Luna herself is so minute that if som outside force did exist and did anything to her it didn't do much.

            Although knowing Gilda's crappy luck,  RD would have rigged the cake to explode or something.  Maybe Gilda was just born being horribly unlucky,  and that's why she's so ornery.
<p></p>Also,  I am I the only person here who would love to see Trixie get double booked with Iron Will?  It would be glorious.
