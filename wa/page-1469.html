            @Moe Dantes: Referring back to your earlier post (I'm not sure what kind of can of worms I'm opening) I find it interesting that both you and I don't like Discord,  but for mostly different reasons.

<p></p>I know Moe doesn't like him because he's overpowered,  but what about you?
<p></p>I mean,  I know you don't like Return of Harmony,  but I didn't know you disliked the character of Discord himself.

            You know,  someone here said that the first two episodes are <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>. While I agree that,  in the strict sense of the word,  this is true,  I always thought that the first two episodes (as well as Return of Harmony) seemed to be way more like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> as it relates to the rest of the series.

I don't necessarily think that,  but if he did say that he found Discord over-powered then I agree with him.
<p></p>Initially I did like him and thought he was deliciously malicious,  but when it came time to enter the maze things kind of went south. At first the "corruption" scenes were flying by rather quickly and my thoughts were "wow our heroes are easily deceived and remarkably weak willed",  but when we get to Fluttershy's scene it becomes "wow our villain is just nigh omnipotent,  our heroes are screwed" and for the most part that was true.
<p></p>The thing that really gets me is that the way they portray Discord makes it so that it is really impossible for him to have lost,  and that really robs the Mane 6 of any sense of victory. At no point did they out-smarted him,  hell at no point did it really fell like they over-powered him. What it felt like Discord just happened to have failed <strong>six spot checks</strong> and assumed they were still corrupt (I think?),  and just sat their and ate rainbow because. . .well we gotta end on a high note some how!
<p></p>So yeah,  one of the biggest problems with Return of Harmony in my opinion.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I was the one who mentioned that and I would agree that the two season openers were the movie if it weren't for the fact that they clearly aren't. Under most circumstances the episodes seem to treat the openers as though they never happened,  but the we get stuff like Luna Eclipsed which could not exist with out them.
<p></p>I kind of wish the writers would utilize the stuff from the openers more,  or just retcon them out entirely instead of treating the openers as "kind of AU,  but not really".

<p></p>He still thought they were corrupted (even though I don't think that came across very well in the episode at all),  note that he still thinks AJ is lying "Oh Applejack don't lie to me. I'm the one who made you a liar."
<p></p>Sad that the ending of ROH could've been improved infinitely if they'd have made the mane cast PRETEND to still be corrupted. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

I must admit that while I love Discord,  I admit that he's too powerful to really be used properly. Which is why,  while I'd love to see him again,  I realise that he just can't be used as is for a recurring villain and changing him too mch would be <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Decay</a>.
<p></p>As for Moe,  I disagree about Discord being a trickstor god. He <em>isn't</em>. He's a malicious sociopath who only cares about making others miserable as he finds it hillarious. That is not normal for a trickster god.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I must admit that I wasn't fond of his defeat either due to how anticlimatic it was,  but I understand that there weren't many other ways out of the problem that wouldn't require <em>another</em> episode.
<p></p>I must admit that I agree that the elements of harmony are underutilised.

            It would be interesting if tasting the Harmony Rainbow so much weakens Discord immensely,  such that he is only merely powerful next time he breaks loose.

            Maybe we can have a tiny piece of Discord 'split off' from his main body (I believe there's a trope called <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingAShadow" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingAShadow">Fighting a Shadow</a>),  with his conciousness,  but greatly reduced power,  seeking to cause discord to awaken the rest of his power.
<p></p>That would still keep him around,  without actually getting rid of his power.
<p></p>Bad new would be the fact that this might cause a shift in focus of new episodes,  dealing with this shard of discord,  rather then their own personal problems,  which are quite interesting on their own.
