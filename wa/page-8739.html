            I cntest the notion that humans make any more or more significant mistakes than ponies. We've seen plentyo f ponies be abusive dicks - more callous than pretty much <em>any</em> people I've met in fact.
<p></p>Look,  I don't want to turn a harmless bout of sockpuppeting into some sort of meta/philosophical thing,  but I cannot <em>stand</em> it when people talk about how 'bad' the human race is. We are not "bad". If anything,  we're good! You point to all these wars and horrors as evidence,  but you fail to see the sheer selflessness that we <em>all</em> pull of every single day!
<p></p>Look around you. Is any of what you see created by selfishness? would it be? <em>could</em> it be? If people were truly so awful and stupid and bad,  nothing that you do on a daily basis would exist. I wouldn't even be able to say this to you because the internet would have never been invented. The internet is the most selfless thing ever created - it is a tool <em>solely</em> for the exchange and growth of knowledge. Imagine that! that's so much better than any of the evils ever done in human history,  and that's just the beginning.
<p></p>Humanity has an incredibly capacity to love. We love each other more than we could ever possibly imagine,  that's why we are what we are. It's the only reason we aren't still living it hutches chucking spears at one another: because we loved each other enough to put down those spears and build something greater.
<p></p>Yes,  there are evil people out there. But wherever there is an evil man,  a million good men will stand up to oppose him. Even if it's none of their business,  even if it wouldn't ever hurt them,  they <em>will</em> stand up. Because that's what we <em>are</em>. We are human fucking beings,  and we are creatures of pure,  unadulterated love. It is what we have always been,  and what we will always be,  until the sun goes black in the sky. And when it does,  you will find us together,  desperately trying to keep someone we've never met warm.

            I thought Loki was an interesting character in both Thor and The Avengers. In Thor,  he was definitely the antagonist,  and tried to have Thor killed,  but in the end,  he was trying not to get revenge on Odin,  but to get his approval and love,  which was an interesting twist. Which made his actions in The Avengers,  after he <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">"saw things"</a>,  all the more wrong. He was crazy and desperate,  which is never a good combination.

            @Turtle: What we are as a large group is mostly an extension of what we were as a small group. It's basically just a larger tribe. It started as tribes,  then grew into villages,  then countries. Each of them has taken some time to settle,  but the incredible thing is that each time is easier than the last,  and comparatively the conflicts are less intense. As we grow,  we become much,  much better.

            Arceusism says that Pokémon should strive to help humans. Whether that be to test their strength in battle,  or join them abnd battle with them,  depends on the Pokémon and the human. Some deny this,  saying that Arceusism doesn't exist,  that rather than a real pokémon religion,  it's just a human's way of explaining wild behavior. However,  if this is the case,  how do you explain pokémon like Audino,  who actively work to heal a Trainer's partners in the short time that they "battle"?
<p></p>And I've heard enough of this "trapped in a ball" nonsense. Pokébolls are an extension of the matter —&gt; data compression systems used all over the world. The balls contain an ideal environment for a pokémon,  or a close approximation. A few extra pokébucks can buy a ball that delivers a full Pokécenter treatment on the first transfer,  or one with an even better,  luxury environment. In addition,  there are pokéballs with specialized environments. There are "net" balls that contain a marshland and forest,  Dusk balls that simulate a cave,  etc.

<p></p>Loki has a way of deafting himself because of his love of drama and theatrics. If he had just dodged the arrow nothing bad would have happened,  but no he had to <em>catch</em> it. The same goes with not just killing the Avengers off right away before they become a threat,  or jabbing at his plan re-the Hulk,  or using Star Towers as his launch site,  the only reason the Heroes win the end is because Loki sabotages himself over and over again.

            I think that the Hulk vs Loki scene was as much for catharsis as anything else. After a movie of Loki tormenting Banner,  treating him as a monster that pretends to be a man,  it's satisfying for it to be the Hulk to finally get him to stop talking.
<p></p>edit: Blissey,  be careful. Blargle Nargle Narf might be a Psyshock sort of deal.

<p></p>Because using Stark Towers as the invasion sight meant that even if the Avengers didn't figure Loki was planning to go from there,  they would have learned in time to do something about it. If he had picked a secluded area far from any form of Media the Avengers wouldn't have learned where he was until it was to late to do anything about it.
