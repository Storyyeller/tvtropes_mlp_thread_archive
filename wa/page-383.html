            I've never understood all the obsessive Fluttershy love in the fandom. I guess I'm just resistant to moe.

            Yeah,  when it comes the main cast its like.... they all go through stages where they start to get bland,  but then just when you think they have they do something that's totally freaking awesome or adorable and you just gotta hug 'em all over again.
<p></p>Like... again with Applejack... dozens of episodes of "I'm from Texas mmkay" and then there's her iconic window scene.
<p></p>Or Pinkie Pie.  Dozens of her just being random and then she starts talking to bags of flour.
<p></p>Honestly,  I'd say Rainbow Dash and Twilight Sparkle stay the most consistently interesting.  I'm sure I'll feel differently next time I post on this subject tho.
<p></p>EDIT:  But now that I think about it,  this is all trying to separate the wheat from the chaff.  Part of what makes any of these characters interesting is their group dynamic,  and a lot of them shine their best in the presence of the others.  On their own,  they're all bland.  It's when they come together that the picture is complete.
<p></p>Or,  should I say... Friendship is Magic ;)

            My least favourite would be Rarity,  mostly because she's least like me.  That said,  being least favourite among my main six ranking isn't really saying much anyway,  since I like all of them.
<p></p>And for me,  Fluttershy doesn't rank higher because of her moeness (well,  maybe a little,  but all of the ponies are so cute that being moe hardly carries extra favour with me),  but because aside from Twilight,  she's shares the next most amount of personality traits with me (starting to see a pattern? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">).

            I love all Mane Cast but if you forcing me to choose.
My least favorite is Rarity,  propably only fashonista character who I really like but in comparition with rest of Mane Six she is least interesting.
<p></p>Second least propably is Fluttershy, .

            I used to think that Applejack was my least favorite,  but then I happened to rewatch "Fall Weather Friends" and realized that I was rooting for her all the way. I still think she is the least developed,  but I like her more than Rainbow Dash at least.

            My favorite is Twilight Sparkle because she's what I'd have liked to be as a kid (I had the bookishness and the smarts and the teacher's pet status and the adorkable excitability but I just didn't have the leadership skills,  which I only started acquiring late in life),  second is Fluttershy because she exemplifies very well my excessively compassionate nature (seriously,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks">Being Good Sucks</a>,  I'm actively striving to learn to be <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">Good Is Not Nice</a> when it's appropriate),  and third is Pinkie Pie because her whole personality is basically me when I feel I'm safe enough to act like myself: cracking jokes and puns all the freaking stime,  singing random songs,  sometimes making them up on the spot,  and generally having a haphazard mental pace that people have trouble following (I,  on the other hand,  have no trouble at all following Pie).
<p></p>Also,  we both have curly hair. After years of trying to fight it into orderliness,  I finally gave up and decided to go for the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoNagai" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoNagai">Go Nagai</a> look.

Stage Two (having sideburns made of hair rather than beard) will take three more months. Hopefully it'll end up looking somewhat like this. ME GUSTA.

            So,  you like tomboys...
<p></p>BTW,  what's with the "Rainbow Dash is a lesbian" controversy? As if that was something bad! If she's a lesbian,  then let her be,  there's nothing wrong with that,  especially since the ponies are supposed to be in their late teens/early adulthood. If she's not,  then no matter. Why even <em>argue</em> about this?
<p></p>And why are all the males in this story either well-intentioned dumbasses,  aloof,  or jerkasses? Why can't the Mane Cast have a male friend or two,  someone who is an equal and who is acknowledged as interesting and intelligent? I'm not asking for the show to get a romantic direction or to make boys central or to create sword counterparts. I just want them to have developed male characters that are as good as the protagonists.

            ^Well,  there's Spike.  He's not all about his crush on Rarity; he actually has a pretty good dynamic with all of the mane cast,  now that I come to think about it.
<p></p>As for why Dash being a lesbian is controversial... a lot of people dislike the automatic assumption that the tomboyish girl with a rainbow mane is the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGay" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGay">Token Gay</a>.  I personally have no opinion on that particular matter; I like Dash as bisexual,  myself (insert wingboner and "I've got <em>plans</em>" jokes here),  but again,  I have no real opinion on the matter.  In the articles linked under <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutShowsYouDontWatch" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutShowsYouDontWatch">Complaining about Shows You Don't Watch</a>,  the writer brings up that point,  but not in a very detailed or well-researched way; and Ms. Faust gives a very good answer,  which amounts to 'there's no reason to link anyone's appearance with what they act like'... or something.  It's a little early here and it's been a while since I checked the link.

            <div class="quoteblock"> Thread hopping from the Dr. Who discussion earlier,  but I watched "Blink,  " and it's one of the best television things I've ever seen. </div>
I bet Death Cloud would like to see My Little Pony handle creatures that only move when you're not looking,  as I can't think of any equivalent G1 villains... though they did have that one who steals youth,  Rapunzel's mother or whoever...
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> "Applebuck Season" was the only episode I can remember where she was the sole star and she was so sleep-deprived in that one she might as well have been stoned,  so it wasn't a very good way for me to get good grasp of her character. </div>
It gets funnier when a gag dub re-interprets her as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG8rcJIgBiI">stone drunk<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  so we learned a very special lesson about substance abuse. (and that Pinkie <em>meant</em> to poison the muffins)
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Well RD's is LOYALTY. Good luck figuring THAT one out </div>
Hey,  even discounting all the "Nice catch <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jercules</span>" moments,  Rainbow Dash was the one who persisted in trying to pull Pinkie Pie out of her funk and bringing her to her birthday party,  despite the fact that we all know Pinkie could have gone Full Cupcakes at any time.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_wink.png" height="16" width="16" alt="wink" title="wink">
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> I'd take any info coming from IMDB with a trip to the Salt Lick,  but if that title is accurate I'll guess its an episode about Fluttershy learning to be more assertive. </div>
Well see,  I think Fluttershy already has gotten more assertive over the last season; the real problem is she's getting totally bipolar in her approach.  I could foresee an episode about Fluttershy having to find "the healthy middle ground" when her passive-aggressive antics start to really hurt some other ponies' feelings.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> BTW,  what's with the "Rainbow Dash is a lesbian" controversy? </div>
I don't know!  It's not as if all lesbians have rainbow hair and squeaking voices and a love of stunt flying.
