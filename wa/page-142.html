            I think Word of God has said there will be more villains next season,  but I doubt it'll be nonstop epic adventures.  I'd bet on it being mostly slice of life with a few bigger eps.

            I thought she just said that there will be a big bad in season 2.
<p></p>Other stuff I've heard is that the quest to defeat Nightmare Moon was originally eight episodes but Faust had to reduce that to two episodes.
<p></p>I've also heard that Princess Luna was infused with "dark energy" to become Nightmare Moon.  I haven't found proof of this yet.  Still,  this might connected to the big bad if there's something to it.

            Yeah there will be a new big bad some time. However all we know is "<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer">yes</a>" so until we're close enough to get info of Season 2 episodes we won't know for sure. I think we'll see some fairly competent villains though

            Is just me or does anyone else want a show or at least an episode that delivers aesops that are both relevant to the episode and give what is objectively a good lesson,  but you don't really get from kids shows. I.E. "Dear Celestia,  Today I learned that in addition to being wrong,  hash interrogations don't give reliable information."
<p></p>And yes I saw that on an earlier page,  that is what put the idea into my head.

I mean,  it's one think to have an aesop like,  "Dear Celestia,  today I learned sometimes you need to lie to protect a friends feelings.",  but it's another thing entirely to have an aesop like,  "Dear Celestia,  today I learned that,  no matter how good your intentions,  and no matter how much you do what you do because it's right,  at the end of the day sometimes you will need to disregard your ethics in order to do what's best."
<p></p>They essentially boil down to the same thing,  right,  but the latter is just way to complicated,  morally speaking,  for a kids show.

            I think it's funny that someone drew the comparisons earlier in this thread between Pinkie and Haruhi. I was just watching Disappearance today,  and something similar popped into my mind. They <em>are</em> both energetic reality benders that have friends that have a hard time keeping up with them.
<p></p>Going farther with this,  Yuki and Twilight are both essentially reserved,  very-powerful,  bookworm magic-users working for a deity.
<p></p>Then there's the moe blobs in both shows that I need not mention by name.
<p></p>And I guess the most masculine major characters in both are snarkers.
<p></p>Uh,  might be a stretch,  but Koizumi and Rarity both have the most class in their group.
<p></p>Maybe MLP is an alternate universe where Haruhi made her friends into ponies,  and... okay I can stop there.

            I was hinting at Kyon being a parallel to Spike. What other major character is more masculine than Kyon? Or,  I guess you thought I was talking about Rainbow Dash or Applejack?
<p></p>Dunno who they could be either,  but as I understand it,  there are more characters in the light novels. Tsuruya is one character I didn't mention,  but I dunno what I'd say about her.

            Oh,  I somehow missed the masculine part. I just saw "snarky" and immediately thought Rainbow Dash. -_-; The problem with Tsuruya is the only character crazy/<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome">Crazy Awesome</a> enough to be her is Pinkie,  but she's already taken up the position of reality warper.

            I also love this episode.
I was litle disopointed that ep wasn't about Ponies not whanting to go to Pinky party,  but if that would be plot of this episode insted what we get we wouldn't get insane Pinky Pie.
<p></p>Since we get Nightmare Fuel  and Memes page for this show maybe we should get pictures for them?

            Yeah,  it's kinda impossible to reasonably depict a super-fun party with like 7 participants.
<p></p>Though wait,  didn't the first episode involve a party that actually had Vinyl Scratch laying down the tracks and whatnot? Didn't that one have actual disco lighting,  too?

            I'm not really sure what you were expecting.  Its still a kids show after all,  they aren't going to have the ponies getting drunk and hooking up with strangers.
<p></p>Dear Princess Celestia,  today I learned that the best friend is one who will hold your mane back while you throw up in the bushes.
<p></p>I'm pretty sure Vinyl was only in the fashion show episode,  but I might be wrong.
