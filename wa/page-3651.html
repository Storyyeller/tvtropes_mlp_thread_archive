            For 1) at least,  it makes sense that considering how life changing an event getting your Cutie Mark is that class takes a lesson off to let the filly or colt teach the rest of the students about it and reinforce why they like their special talent so much.

<p></p>"@Kyler's remark: Her cutie mark is an astonishingly accurate U-238 atom symbol. A strange Alicorn formed when a pregnant Unicorn Princess was exposed to a spent (yet still radioactive) fuel rod that accidentally into Equestria while hiding under a rock shelter from a rogue Everfree storm that somehow traveled a great distance into her country. She is actually weaker than most standard Deity-type alicorns because her mutations make her only as strong as 1/3 Unicorn,  1/3 Pegasus,  and 1/3 Earth Pony,  and constantly leaks ambient magic so she has to wear a mana sealing crystal made up into a beautiful necklace.
