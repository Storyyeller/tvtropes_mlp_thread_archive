            Most powerful unicorn (that mean something) Celestia right hand pony and closet friend (that apply to Luna too),  sister of Royal Guard captain,  probably her parents may have some high status too.  But she don't care about this,  she care about study,  knowledge,  power plus family/friends.
<p></p>And Fancy Pants may be only pony from that episode who recognize her.  Maybe he wasn't trying to protect Twilight from those snobs but protect snobs.

            I think you're over-analyzing this. Twilight's Celestia's student for story reasons. She's also a regular girl for the same reasons. Even if it may seem like those two conflict,  it's in the interest of the plot to explain those issues away and maintain both,  to keep both the "audience surrogate" and "girl fantasy" aspects of the character.
<p></p>So,  a situation where Twilight starts throwing her weight around should never occur without sacrificing something character essential.

            Twilight has shown occasional ego problems due to her background and connections with Celestia,  but doesn't really get that vindictive about it,  just kind of stuck up and insistant on being taken seriously. She was thoroughly oblivious in the episode to really be offended anyway,  she was <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdorkAble" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdorkAble">too blissfully happy</a> at her party.
<p></p>As said it almost seems like a touch of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>,  in the pilot she thought friends were pointless and was more interested in her position as Celestia's student. In this episode she is solely interested in being with friends and having fun,  if still amusingly narrow minded about it.

            Trixie had a rather awkwardly done introduction,  which almost seems like it made solely to set her up as a recurring villain. She seems kind of cool on paper,  sort of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie">Jerkass Woobie</a> villain that just wants to be respected and accepted as awesome and almighty,  but will do anything to get it.
<p></p>I still like the idea of a recurring comical plot with loads of fearsome villains and monsters appearing to drive fear into the ponies,  and each one having Trixie pop out from her disguise when defeated,  being yet another scheme to be taken seriously (anyone seen the Master Drunk's boss robots in <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBobble" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBobble">Puzzle Bobble</a> will probably get what I mean).

            I want them to play Trixie's return (IF they do it) as a serious revenge story,  but that's just me. I always imagine things darker than they need to be.

            Bringing back an old character isn't pandering,  especially if they're relevant to the plot and not just a cameo. And if they are just a cameo,  then they're harmless regardless.

            Gilda is the one I'd <em>really</em> like to see return.  I can't see her and Dash being good good friends again like before,  but they could at least get back into each others good books.

            I think it would work to have some more recurring villains,  maybe make some more sympathetic or three dimentional. I still think they are one element the series is still a bit too one note about.

<p></p>I totally agree.  A good recurring villian is the thing I most want to see in the show.  That's why I like DT so much.
<p></p>And I said this before but,  Pinkie flirting with a possible villian could be down right hilarious.

            Yeah,  the reason they haven't turned up again already was more or less because the show was trying to be far less continuity heavy. By the end of the second season,  though,  they've more or less thrown that out the window. The best example being the Cake twins,  who were introduced in an episode,  then almost immediately became minor recurring characters. Not to mention that Ponyville Confidential was filled with more <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">ContinuityNods</a> than you can shake a stick at.
