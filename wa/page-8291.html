            @Ginger I know I've asked you this before,  but where the hell are you getting your information on what people like and don't like? Most of us very much <em>do</em> like all of the things you like. Just because we <em>also</em> like other things doesn't mean that the first thing is somehow hated.
<p></p>Honestly,  IMO,  AJ is the second deepest out of the Mane 6 behind Rarity. She's not perfect,  but she <em>tries</em> to be. It's when she isn't honest with <em>herself</em> about her imperfections that she has problems/suffers from breakdowns. Combine that with a very prominent family to interact with and bounce off of,  and you have a lot of characterization right there.

            @Turtle when push came to shove and with more workers (which AJ was actually willing to use this time. See,  she CAN learn her lessons) they were able to make more <em>quality</em> cider than the Flim Flams could.
<p></p>It was a moral thing. The Flim Flams were so willing to forsake quality for quantity at the drop of a hat. That doesn't bode well for them as professionals <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            Maybe this is why I love AJ going against RD so much. AJ is obviously the more moralistic of the two but RD gets under her skin so much,  it brings out her amusing flaws and quirks such as her temper and self righteousness,  so that both characters are making the gags and holding the spotlight. My problem with more conventional Straight Man is that they are usually so sane and normal they actually are very dull (keep in mind <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MickeyMouse" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MickeyMouse">Mickey Mouse</a>).
<p></p>Another example is Twilight vs Pinkie. Twilight is saner but <em>completely</em> exasperated by Pinkie's insanity so her neurotics are as much the humor as Pinkie's wackiness.

            I think it would have been beneficial for both parties if the Apples and Flim-Flam brothers had been able to come to a fair agreement reguarding profit sharing.  The Apples were just a bit too luddite for me by immediately denouncing the machine.

            @ginger: How about Mmm Mystery? That was a good example of what I'm aiming for with Twilight,  though it's sadly also an example of what I'm going for with Season Two AJ.
