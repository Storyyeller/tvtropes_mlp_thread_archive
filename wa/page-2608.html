            It isn't like it isn't accurate.  Some people really are just naturally inclined to be really good at something.  It's only annoying in fiction if the character is naturally gifted and doesn't have to work at it.  Twilight clearly does work at her magic,  so it isn't an issue.

            @JT but why does she NEED potential in the first place?!
<p></p>My issue was never "she didn't work hard for her power",  it's "someone else could've trained JUST as hard as her,  but because she lacked the raw potential that Twilight was BORN with,  she's shit out of luck"

            Yeah,  Twilight has raw power,  but she had to learn how to use it.  Having tons of mana is kinda totally useless if you can't use it for anything.  Heck,  I don't think it's a stretch to say that other unicorns might have an easier time learning magic if they don't have to worry about keeping a crazy amount of mana under control.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Because,  simply put,  it makes sense in the context of the story.  Every pony has a special talent,  and there's no reason that Twilight's talent can't be magic.  Also,  some people are just better at things than others,  and the story reflects that.  I know you don't like that in your stories,  but that doesn't make it bad writing.

            I get what you're saying,  I just don't see how it's an issue.  Okay,  so Trixie would never be able to beat Twilight even if she had spent years practicing and not just showing off.  So what?  That's pretty accurate to real life.  Do you think you could out swim Michael Phelps even if you'd spent your whole life training?  Probably not.  Sometimes someone is just really good at something.

If we take your train of thought to its logical conclusion,  everypony is exactly the same aside from the stuff they like doing.  But it makes for more interesting characters when some elements are out of their control.

            Ginger,  <em>nobody knows</em> whether or not someone else could have reached her level. Nopony in Ponyville cares to try. There could very well be unicorns elsewhere in Equestria with her level of skill,  but our point of view is limited,  so we never meet them. You're jumping to conclusions for no reason other than your own paranoia. Just headcanon it a way that makes you happy and roll with it.

We've yet to see another unicorn that actually cares about magic power and has been shown to put anywhere near as much effort into it as Twilight has.  The closest we've got is Trixie,  but there's no indication that she actually studied all that much.

            Yeah,  I don't think <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">Superpower Lottery</a> applies here; that would be if she had like Celestia-tier magic without even having to try,  or if her innate magic allowed her to copy any spell every without having to study it.

            It's just that in Equestria passion and talent are very visibly married. In our world we're still more likely to be passionate in something we're good at,  we just don't have nice,  flashy tattoo to show for it.
<p></p>On the subject of Trixie,  I find it slightly annoying that people keep setting her up as Twilight's nemesis. Foil I get,  because that is her narrative existensial purpose,  but Trixie doesn't actually out and out antagonize Twilight,  does she?

            Look at it this way,  Ginger.  We'll never know if any of the other unicorns could reach Twilight's skill with magic,  because they don't want to try to.  Twilight's potential means nothing; it's <em>what she's done with it</em> that makes her the most powerful.

            Because if Twilight had worked her way up from <strong>absolutely</strong> <strong>NOTHING</strong> Jack Rakan-style,  then it would've been the single greatest thing EVER.
<p></p>Why does everyone want things to be realistic? I was born with a better capacity to analyze films than my peers in college,  and I hate myself for it every single day. It's not fair. My fellow students work SO much harder than I do.

            I don't reall view any of their "Special Talents" as superpowers myself. It's more like that carrer your really passionat about,  that job you love every second of,  that field of study that you always want to learn more about. She is good at what she does because she loves to do it.
<p></p>She talent  isn't magic because she's powerful in it,  she is powerful because magic is her talent. Or something like that
