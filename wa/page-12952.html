            Well obviously some people want them,  or at least think it's an interesting concept to explore in fanfic. But it would obviously never fit in the show itself.
<p></p>Even ATLA didn't mention rape and it was pretty dark for a kid's show.

<p></p>seriosly EVERY. SINGLE. THING. points to the exact oppostie of any of that shit being in Equestria,  why the hell do you have to shoehorn it in? isn't there enough of that "life sucks and everyone in it sucks more" crap in,  you know,  pretty much every single other show out there?

<p></p>ATLA isn't slice-of-life,  though. It had war and genocide built into its concept from day one. It's not demographics,  it's genre and tone.

            @Perpetual: That's really the heart of the question though: do we assume stuff like rape and genocide are occurring offscreen even though there's no evidence of it?  Also,  Seinfeld isn't exactly the best example,  because it's unambiguously set in the real world.  With Equestria it's a fully fictional setting.  We know for a fact that those things will never be so much as referenced,  and as a result there's zero reason to assume that they would occur other than "they happen in the real world".  Basically,  my question is "why are people so adamant about reading real-world issues into a fictional (and obviously fanciful) setting?"

            In fairness FIM is something of a shaudenfreude comedy. It's usually balanced properly with sentiment and redemption for the characters but mostly revolves around crap happening to the cast,  and at points even having darkly comedic mental breakdowns from the abuse. I guess this may be where some writers overestimate the mark for this and the complaints towards the likes of Williams begin.

            Sorry,  but,  this is NOT the real world,  at all,  there is NO evidence of that shit happening,  at all,  and no REASON for it to be past "all sentient species have to be bastards and have shit like this." Yes they aren't perfect,  but they are way the hell better then THAT. And no I really do't mind fics and what not that go down that past,  since as i've said all fic to me are in an AU of their own,  things can change. but saying the Equestria seen in show is just a sham simply because cycism hatred and pain have to be a major part of EVERYTHING,  that's it,  WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY!?

<p></p>I'm not assuming anything. I'm just saying that it doesn't matter in this genre. When someone writes a fic in a (much) darker genre,  like FOE,  then they can extrapolate those details however they wish. When discussing the canon of the show itself,  though,  it's irrelevant because nothing related to it in the slightest will ever be presented.

            @Seraphem: Dude,  chill.  Or take a break or something.
<p></p>@Perpetual: Well obviously AU stuff is free to do whatever. I'm just thinking of people who assume that kind of stuff about canon and actually take it seriously,  because like you said,  it's never going to come up,  and there's no reason to believe that it would happen anyway.

            Seriously,  just,  the,  the mindset to assume the worst,  no matter what,  WHY!? Why the hell can't there be one damn thing that isn't taken a twisted? And,  all it's doing is reinforcing my feelings on ponies v. humans that people would default to,  yeah total hell hole they just slap a coat of pretty paint over it for the kiddies. instead of,  wow,  they really are just nice friendly and just plain good.
<p></p>There is enough issues that it isn't perfect,  but a far far cry from anything even close to what you are trying to say it must be.

<p></p>You know despite it being kind of a weird trademark of the show (or at least that seems to be what people remember),  it doesn't happen nearly as often as some would make it out.

            Yeah,  it really doesn't happen as often as one would think from the fandom.

            My point is the show isn't against having the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a>. It's not overdone for the most part,  and the show is still very soft and whimsical,  but it does have it's 'cruel' humor at times.
