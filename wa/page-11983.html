            There's also the fact that they would need <em>every</em> pegasi pony to do it. One of the pegasi in the beginning even reads the notice,  and it says "<em>MANDATORY</em> meeting for all Ponyville pegasi."

            Folks,  could I ask you all how 'religion' might work within Equestria without things getting nasty?
<p></p>I first want to say,  that I don't see Tia as a god...nah,  she's more like the pope,  or the Dalai Lama.  And their religion worships the concept of friendship itself.  Their nation and society is built on it.
<p></p>Any suggestions?

            Religion is actually an interesting notion... I mean in my headcanon I've worked out effectively how their afterlife works(red: It does not. They have reincarnation and spirits,  but no proepr afterlife),  but the only ponnies who would know this for sure are the gods,  and they aren't talking.
<p></p>I imagine it could develop in a lot of ways. It's very clear that the ponies have a level of reverance for the goddeses,  but it's never made clear how much of this is over divinity versus mere royalty. IT's very probable that the 'main' religion is the worship of one's patron deities,  and in this case there'd be little need for overt worship since... well,  they have the word of god handed down to them directly. It's called 'the law'.
<p></p>What mkaes it most difficult to judge is that we don't HAVE any uber-powerful beings to deign as deities,  so it's hard for us to predict them. I don't think it's impossible that there would be at least some form of cult that worshipped other things - nature is probably a big one,  and It wouldn't surprise me to see an organization that treats magic as a blessing from some unseen god - I recall reading a story that referred to 'the providences',  although it had nothing much to do with religion in and of itself. And of course there's always the notion of discord-worshippers,  or possibly harmony-worshippers as well. For my own headcanon I consider Harmony and Discord to be twin eldritch abomination who just sort of accidentally made the world through their eternal conflict,  so I'm inclined to lean towards that answer...
<p></p>TL;DR: Society is most likely barely religious,  or completely areligious due to a 'god' being a part of every day life and literally governing them anyways,  but I imagine there are several smaller religions,  so... make shit up,  really. Nobody's going to blame you for it. Well. Some people will,  but they're well worth ignoring.

            Well,  atheism can't possibly exist in pony society due to the gods living among them. They can't have faith either. Faith implies you believe in something despite lack of evidence but,  again,  the gods are right in front of them.
<p></p>Celestia,  Luna and Discord would definitely be considered deities of some kind. I'm not so sure about Cadence.

            @Applelight: Going solely by the show's canon; they don't seem to have any form of organized religion.  Their society is based around the central idea that friendship is awesome,  but it isn't really religious in any notable way.  The basic idea is compatible with both religious and secular philosophies,  so you could really spin it either way.  They obviously won't bring up the subject in-show,  though.
<p></p>Likewise,  races or other countries might have different core philosophies (Again,  we have no idea),  and some of them might be formalized as religious in nature,  but it's really entirely conjecture.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Honestly,  I don't even necessarily buy that Celestia and Luna are even deities.  The reverence they receive from the ponies borders on it at points,  but there's no indication that they're anything other than ponies who happen to be powerful and long-lived.  The only being who approaches the level of power of divinity is Discord,  and even he got his butt kicked by the elements.  Honestly,  if anything the abstractions of the elements of harmony are the guiding forces of the setting.  They're the only things that haven't been defeated in some fashion; every time they're used,  they end up winning.
<p></p>Also,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">That it is not at all what faith means in a religious context</a>,  at least not most of the time.  It's something more akin to trusting someone or something. It's entirely possible for the ponies to have faith in Celestia; in fact,  that's practically been shown.  They have faith in the sense that they trust her to do the right thing despite the fact that it's impossible to quantifiably prove that she will.  It's a character thing,  not a "does this thing objectively exist or not exist" thing.

<p></p>That's interesting...harmony is Equestria's binding trait,  and it could be either religiously or secularly followed.

            @Librarian: She did order said conspiracy to disband back when it was (semi-)official,  but still doesn't want Harry to personally handle interrogations (even if all he did was scare the last suspect a bit),  wants him to travel with an elite palace guard escort (and really,  how well would <em>that</em> work when <em>anyone</em> could be in on the Kill Harry plot),  and most important of all,  wants him to only limit his investigation to Ponyville.
<p></p>Sounds pretty suspicious to me.

            No it's pretty much,  she doesn't want to risk harry,  well being Harry,  and hurting/killing a pony out of anger if he finds out they put his friends at risk. Also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Bon Bon is SO FUCKED!</span>
<p></p>it's pretty clear she doesn't fully trust harry,  she believes he has a good heart,  and is overall a good person,  but he's still a person,  violent,  prone to anger and rage,  a bit unstable,  and willing to go far far far further then anypony would think to avenge/protect his friends.
