            ^I think "Sisterhooves Social" pretty much solidifies Rarity's family's structure,  though.  Parents and two daughters - both Rarity and Sweetie Belle act like they only have the one sister,  after all.

            I'm just wondering where Rarity's parents live.  It must be in town somewhere,  but didn't we see Rarity in Carousel Boutique during her flashback?  So did they just move and leave the place to her?

            Oh,  the whole Vinyl/Rarity thing gets <em>better</em>
<p></p>Remember "The Show Stoppers"? Remember Sweetie Belle's mane during the performance? Its pretty much a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swap</a> of Vinyl's!
<p></p>I personally like the idea of Vinyl and Rarity being twins,  with Vinyl wearing shades and dying her mane to cover up this fact. Its as likely as Octavia being Pinkie's sister,  and I like it for the same reasons... <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingYinYang" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingYinYang">Its hilarious to think about</a>!

            For the record,  I'm defending her actions as being a reasonable response to Sweetie Belle's shenanigans,  as well as being in character for her.  I don't have siblings,  but I have a comparably aged cousin,  so I know exactly what that sort of crap is like.

            Probably because Rarity likely hasn't lived with her parents or with Sweetie Belle for a few years. She might watch Sweetie on occasion,  but its not hard to imagine Rarity being used to her own space and having extended period with her sister,  especially during an important work period,  was something she got initially overwhelmed by.

            Hey,  the Friendship Express Train in the opening is different now!
<p></p>In "Lesson Zero" and "Luna Eclipsed" it's like this:
<ul><li> Blue,  yellow-roofed engine (containing one stallion)
</li><li> Brown,  pink-roofed car (containing three elderly ponies) with a second level (containing Derpy)
</li><li> Brown,  yellow-roofed car (containing three mares)
</li><li> Brown,  blue-roofed car (containing three mares)
</li><li> Brown,  purple-roofed car (containing one mare and two mustached stallions) with a pink platform (holding a suitcase and a trunk)
</li><li> Blue,  yellow-roofed caboose (containing two mares)
</li><li> Blue,  yellow-rimmed cart (containing the Cutie Mark Crusaders)
</li></ul><p></p>In "Sisterhooves Social" it's like this (changed colors are in <strong>bold</strong>,  moved segments are in <em>italics</em>):
<ul><li> <strong>Pink</strong>,  yellow-roofed engine (containing one stallion)
</li><li> Brown,  pink-roofed car (containing three elderly ponies) with a second level (containing Derpy)
</li><li> <strong><em>Purple</em></strong>,  <strong>pink</strong>-roofed car (containing one mare and two mustached stallions) with a <strong>blue</strong> platform (holding a suitcase and a trunk)
</li><li> <em>Brown,  yellow-roofed car (containing three mares)</em>
</li><li> <em>Brown,  blue-roofed car (containing three mares)</em>
</li><li> <strong>Pink</strong>,  yellow-roofed caboose (containing two mares)
</li><li> Blue,  yellow-rimmed cart (containing the Cutie Mark Crusaders)
</li></ul><p></p>The engine has the same color as its toy version now (and the caboose's color still matches the engine's),  but your guess is as good as mine about the rearranging and the other color changes.

MISUNDERSTANDING! XD I was talking about the guy who was talking about Rarity and Vinyl being twins; I pointed out if they were twins,  then Rarity would have been used to having a sibling,  or at least have remembered any lessons she learned about siblinghood in the past growing up. In the episode it was like she had never really learned about sisterhood in general.
<p></p>Which begs the question; what WAS sweetie's and Rarity's relationship like before this episode? Was this the first time in Sweetie's life that Rarity and her had spent any extended time with each other?

<p></p>Possibly pretty different from that of Spike/Twilight and AJ/AB. In both relationships the younger ones had lived with their respective older sibling for some time,  and worked with them specifically in their chosen fields.
<p></p>Rarity/SB by contrast don't strike me as immediately close,  largely because the latter already had older people to take care of her as opposed to Spike and Applebloom who had the likes of Twilight and Applejack/Big Macintosh to look after them.

            I know but it just strikes me odd that this is the first time they've ever really bonded in her entire life. It sure seemed that way. Rarity had no clue how to act around her and only started being actually sibling like in the end,  implying she and Sweetie had pretty much never ever ever spent more than an hour in a room with each other,  which strikes me as odd since Sweetie is at least a good few years old,  and in all that time they never bonded once?
