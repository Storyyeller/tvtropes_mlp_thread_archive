            @Blue: Aaaaaah the class bits irk me. I mean I feel good when I get them right,  but so often I'm just guessing. It doesn't help that fucking Mooroka is such a cunt about it.
<p></p>The cooking bits are sort of fun,  but I do object to the fact that you can fail it and just wind up with garbage. I have to cook my own meals,  and I learned quickly that it doesn't matter what you do to something,  unless you char it black you can still turn it into a damn good meal.
<p></p>The very first one I did in the game I was making pork,  and when it asked me what to do I picked to cover it in oil. This is because covering something in oil makes it heat evenly,  which A) makes it much easier to tell how done it is and B) gives you very juicy meat.

            @ Ginger whether you like it or not doesn't change the FACT that ALL ponies have one are in which they just excel at with ease. That is just a simple hard FACT about Equestria that thiat is how things are.
<p></p>Ok so it annoys you...WHY!? EVERYPONY has that ability,  and what's more,  the thing they can do with ease,  is what they LOVE doing,  they don't care that the pony with a racing cutie mark is faster then them,  they are better then that pony at something else.
<p></p>And I love ya ging,  but even i'm getting annoyed a bit at riding around this crater of circular logic every week. Sorry,  we understand you feel this way,  but the endless debates that are nothing but everyone saying the same thing over and over for a half hour or so repeated every few days is getting old.

            @Ginger: But this isn't a show built around power levels that carry from episode to episode.  I can understand it in action shows where an ever-growing threat is part of the plot,  but this just isn't a show like that.  It's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a>.  There are no power levels.  RD doesn't have to face ever-increasing threats.  It's her <em>job</em>.  When you do a <em>job</em> you usually do the same or similar things over and over and get better at it.  I'm not going to say anything else,  because it never goes anywhere anyway.
<p></p>@Crow: I'm actually working on it right now. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">  I <em>may</em> have it done tonight,  but don't hold your breath.

            Eh,  I'd rather do it honestly. Besides,  a few of them I do at least have some inkling of,  so I like to see if I'm right.
<p></p>This is only my first play of the game,  obviously. I like to do things clean the first time around,  without looking at any hints or guides if I can help it. But I diiiiiid kinda have to look at one to figure out how to get Kanji's social link,  since he doesn't approach you like the others do.
