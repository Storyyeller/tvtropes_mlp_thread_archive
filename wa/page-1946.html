            Having trcuks in equestria is one thing,  but jets? The guy's name is Jet-setter but I have a hard time picturing that level of technology in this show.
<p></p>We learned a surprising amount about Celestia in this episode,  especially considering she barely appears in it. Now that we've gotten a better look at Canterlot society we now know what is expected of Celestia,  even though what we know about her suggests she'd choose the Party-cannon party over the garden party if she had the choice.
<p></p>I believe that the ideal for pony beuty was modeled after Celestia,  not the other way around. She's over a thousand years old and she can raise the sun,  definitly someone the Canterlot locals would like to emulate.
<p></p>How long do you think Celestia and Luna have had power over the sun and moon? Is it something they were born with? We know Discord was the guy in charge before they took the throne,  so if I had to guess I'd say he did watever he wanted with the sun and moon until the sisters came along and had to work out a system that doesn't drive pnies crazy. Maybe their immortality and cosmmic power came after they dispatced the mix'n match emperor? The more I think about this the more questions I have.

<p></p>ok re viewing it's not all the lyrics,  it's just the "Everypony should know" part I just didn't really get.
<p></p>Also,  yeah the Canterlot elite are basicly sheep. Rarity knows the princess and Fancy-Pants likes her,  must seek her approval of my work/choose the same food she does/want the same auction pieces she does etc...
<p></p>Thos ponies are hicks,  Wait fancy-Pants likes them,  there great ponies

            What is Hearth's Warming Eve celebrating anyway? We know what Nightmare Night was about,  and I'm very glad they tied its origins into pony lore so it wasn't just a generic Halloween clone.
<p></p>For whatever reason I find Rarity songs to be my favorites. I think it's because the lyrics tend to be more complex and less predictable than some other songs. I know I'll probably get lynched for saying this but I didn't actually like the song in "May the Best Pet Win" all that much.

            Excellent episode. Song was great,  likewise. Canterlot's a terrible place to live.
<p></p>Fancy Pants is a pretty cool guy,  though. Also found the scene transition between the garden party and Twilight's party hilarious.

            @ Will: About six months ago I had to make a neverwinter module for a school project,  and the sotry was pretty loosley based on MLP,  more specifically the story of how Celestia nad Luna got their divinity in the first place.
<p></p>The basic idea was that they were citizens of a kingdom ruled by "The King of Heaven" (A single god who ruled over the sun,  moon and stars,  and a surprisingly good anaolog for discord),  who had long since gone insane and spent time torturing his citizens. Magic users (rare and not necessarily genetic in this universe) were exempt from this treatment,  being brought to the palace to be raised as nobility and trained in the kings personal army. The Celestia and Luna analogs went out into the city at one point and found out what was happening,  and went on a quest to stop it.
<p></p>The end result is that 'Discord' got his power from an ancient,  powerful artifact (an analog for the elemnts of harmony). The sisters found the pieces of the artifact,  put it back together,  and used it to steal his power. The power needed a receptacle,  however,  as it was what made the sun and moon move in the first place,  so Luna and Celestia had to take the powers on themselves.
<p></p>So yeah,  basically my head canon is that Discord used to be the one in charage of everything,  but Luna and Celestia stole his power and used it to become goddesses themselves.

            One thing that stood out to me about today's episode.  I always thought Celestia and Luna were the only ponies with "horse-like" builds.  But apparently not... Fancy Pants and that skinny girl he was with are both horse-like.
<p></p>It does make me wonder though,  what determines the body type,  and why 99% of ponies are "normal" ponies while we've only seen more "horse-likes" so far.  Is it perhaps a nobility/pure bloodlines thing?  Is there in fact some eugenics at work here?
<p></p><span class="strike">or maybe the animators finally worked up the courage to attempt new body builds?</span>
