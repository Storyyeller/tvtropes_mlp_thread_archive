            For old time's sake,  my cheapo netbook has had that ancient circa early-2000s copy of Photoshop 6.0 I managed to salvage from somewhere loaded on it. It's got a processor superior to the Centrinos and K6-2's and Pentium 4's of the time period,  even if it's a featherweight Atom N455 running XP.
<p></p>If I need to,  I'll go back to using the olde Photoshop for my works :V
<p></p>Also,  as long as the ponies retain the magic Lauren invested in them,  I'll continue to support them :D Even if they have <em>8</em> seasons like <em>My Little Dashie</em> claims it's gonna have.
<p></p>For a weekly deal,  13-26 episode seasons is fine :D

            I guess daily airings would work for a 65 episode season,  but with that you would have to either produce the whole season before hand,  or go really cheap on the animation. Both options probably run animators ragged. It's just more economically sound to go for shorter,  quality over quantity seasons,  and if you need more episodes you get another season.

            I've actually seen a lot of opinions on this episode,  and the general sentiment is that they find Merriweather's writing doesn't really work as well as they would like.

            Does it really matter how many episodes there are in a season? I'd expect quality to be more a function of how often they're expected to crank out an episode,  and how much resources they have in terms of budget and manpower. A longer season just means,  well,  a longer season.

            All those  shows like Red Dwarf or Black Adler have good episodes but not that good to justified having such short season. I prefer  american shows with long season. More fun.

            I do agree,  so far this season has been slightly better.  Because the lesson don't always need to be learned by one of the Main Six anymore,  a lot can be done with only a handful of the cast being featured in an adventure instead of all 7 main characters,  making room to explore the world more.  I seen people hate this season for this same reason too.
