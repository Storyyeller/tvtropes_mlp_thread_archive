            I suppose you have a point Kyler,  I guess I'm just used to playing the ridiculously high power games that one of my GM's run.  In one I think my lowest score is an eleven.  of course I believe we were given about 75-80 points to play with.  I' have also played lower power games and don't really have anything against stat dumping,  personally.  I've always just heard about it discussed in just about a universally negative light.

            While a Jack of all Stats hardly helps anyone,  you also don't want someone who can't even drag their own stuff around (STR dump),  spek liek caveman (INT dump),  or should not under any circumstances talk to anyone else (CHA dump).
<p></p>I've been hearing about this Pathfinder thing,  but I haven't been able to take a proper look at it. Maybe soonish.

            Well,  Pathfinder introduces some new bugs itself,  but I will agree it fixes most things.  Pathfinder and some of the revisions to rogues and Combat maneuvers was what led one of my friends to give up playing a rogue in one campaign I'm currently in.

            I just checked,  and the 4ed Standard Array is 16,  14,  13,  12,  11,  10. And that's not counting racial bonuses. It's actually fairly common to start with an 18 in your primary attribute.

            @Ginger: Charisma is vital for interacting with other people,  and especially if you're playing a Sorceror (since their magic is built off of Cha).  My DM explained it to me that Charisma is how you interact with people,  not just how charming you are - a Cha score of 1,  for example,  translates in a real-world setting to profound autism.

This always depends on the DM and the kind of campaign they're currently running. I've seen cases of very little combat,  and plenty of Bluff and Diplomacy.

            storyyeller,  I think it was how the way CMD was calculated made getting a decent tumble unnecessarily difficult due to the generally exchange rate of skill point vs. looking to beat a 17-20+ on average.

<p></p>Thanks!  He's an inventor,  so he can build and enchant machines like gyrocopters,  automatons and the like...but he's keen to unrival the mysteries of time and space...and his dream is to build a functioning time machine.  In the quest to do that,  he's built a crude <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chronoscope" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chronoscope">Chronoscope</a>,  and has spells that mess around with time.
<p></p>Anyway,  how can this all be represented by stats?  What skills would suit a pony using that kind of stuff?

            Here's the full details to the point buy system. Each standard race gives you +2 in two attributes,  on top of the numbers here.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">This method is a little more complicated than the standard
array,  but it gives comparable results. With this
method,  you can build a character who’s really good
in one ability score,  but at the cost of having average
scores in the other five.
Start with these six scores: 8,  10,  10,  10,  10,  10. You
have 22 points to spend on improving them. The cost
of raising a score from one number to a higher number
is shown on the table below.
Score Cost Score Cost
9 — (1)* 14 5
10 0 (2)* 15 7
11 1 16 9
12 2 17 12
13 3 18 16
<ul><li> If your score is 8,  you can pay 1 to make it 9 or 2 to make
</li></ul>it 10. You must buy your score
<p></p>Here are some sample ability arrays you can generate
using this method:
14 13 13 13 13 13
14 14 13 13 13 11
14 14 14 12 12 11
14 14 14 14 12 8
15 14 13 12 12 11
15 15 13 12 11 10
16 15 12 11 11 10
16 14 14 12 11 8
16 16 12 10 10 10
16 16 12 11 11 8
17 15 12 11 10 8
17 14 12 11 10 10
18 13 13 10 10 8
18 14 11 10 10 8
18 12 12 10 10 10
Apply your racial ability adjustments (see Chapter 3)
after you determine your scores.

            And Honestly,  with a high enough Charisma you can <em>talk</em> your way out of a fight. I've heard stories of people playing entire games on bluff,  speaking and disguise skills.
<p></p>Any build is viable,  if you play it right. For example,  it's possible to play a cleric as a barbarian - just dump yourself with buffs before a battle and wade into the fight. You'll actually be harder to kill than a standard barbarian,  if your skills are high enough.
<p></p>I'm debating between making one of those and making a bard/scout pegasus. Or possibly an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Actual Pacifist</a> cleric.
