            The best thing about the Trixie and Lyra toys is that they're more or less spot-on with the descriptions of the characters:
<p></p>Trixie: “Trixie Lulamoon is great at magic tricks,  but sometimes she likes to show off a little too much!”
<p></p>Lyra: “Lyra Heartstrings loves to play! She finds a way to have fun no matter where she goes.”

            <div class="quoteblock">But what bothers me is that ponies can still apparently breed with donkeys as indicated by the mention of mules indicating that they're similar species,  but donkeys are entirely realistic save for their sentience while ponies are magical animals. Come to think of it,  when we did SEE a mule,  he had all the traits of donkeys and no colors,  wings/horns,  or cutie marks indicating he inherited anything from the pony side. I know pony genetics is weird,  but this point is really bugging me. </div>
<p></p>How do you know that Donkeys don't have magic? There's no reason why they can't.

            Oh yes,  I did take a look at that last night,  and meant to give a response.
<p></p>Well,  as much as I enjoy music I'm not terribly grand for critiquing it. I can tell you,  at least,  that the lyrics are fairly solid. You've altered the measure of some of the segments,  which is usually a problem,  but given the whole point of this is that it can apply to most anything it's not a huge deal,  so the lyrics are solid.
<p></p>As for the singing... well... it's a good idea you've decided to get someone else to sing it,  we'll say. And since you HAVE,  there's very little reason for me to give a token attempt at critiquing it which,  let's face it,  I couldn't anyways.

            @Ginger Well,  the best parts of that fic for me are the strategies and creative uses of magic. All of the different kinds of magic users in the tournament are really cool as well. As for significant events,  some specific highlights (in my book) are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Twilight facing off against a Griffon who specializes in summoning/conjuring magic,  which happens to include <em>necromancy</em>,  and Twilight using a drain spell to steal a massive amount of magical energy from a dragon mage,  only to find out that energy from another being also comes with their general personality,  instincts,  and temperament,  meaning that she is nearly overcome with the desire to <em>brutally murder</em> her opponent rather than simply disable them.</span>

            Well guys I learned something important today.
<p></p>Blades are very sharp. And you should not accidentally cut your self with them.
<p></p>However,  tight band-aids look kinda cool when they're on a few fingers.
