            I was REALLY hoping they'd go to Saddle Arabia in S3 and there would be some camels there.  All we got was the Arabian horse diplomats which were cool,  but not as cool as camels.

            Excellent timing there,  Orion.
<p></p>I dunno... I'd be pretty weirded out,  honestly. The implications of an existing universe that's an exact copy of a television program is existentially fucked,  to be honest.
<p></p>Also it should be noted that horses are considered 'odd-toed ungulates',  so toe and hoof are not mutually exclusive. Camels do KIND OF have hooves,  they're just very small comparatively.

            My reaction to being in Esquestria? I would be surprised and flabbergasted at the sight of a certain pink pony bouncing around the whole of Ponyville while trying to retain my composure but failing miserably to do so.
<p></p>@Orion Speaking of worlds,  Orion what would your reaction be like if you ended in my world?

            Yeah,  my first reaction would be a mental crisis because I somehow <em>ended up in a fictional universe</em>.  That alone would probably cause my head to pop.   Assuming it didn't I'd be paranoid that people could see me.

            Well,  there's a cause/effect mystery,  for one. Did we create the universe by making a show about it? Did the universe always exist and the writers somehow get in sync with it? What implications does that have for <em>our</em> universe? Are <em>we</em> simply the penstroke of someone elsewhere? Is that someone God? If so,  does that mean he doesn't know we're alive,  or doesn't care?

            Little girls would think you were awesome. Little boys would think you were awesome but wouldn't want to say so,  so would say you were dumb and/or gay. Most adults would freak the fuck out. A select few adults would try and communicate with you. Despite what people seem to think,  I really don't think <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWouldCutYouUp" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWouldCutYouUp">They Would Cut You Up</a> applies... I mean,  if you talk you can be communicated with and are probably sapient. Anyone who doesn't run screaming isn't going to pass up the chance to learn about your culture,  and even if we wanted to learn about your biology we could get the basics by <em>asking</em> you. If you've got some way of getting back to your home 'planet' then we could meet your doctors and get to know form them,  and if not we can wait until you die of natural causes,  thereby getting a picture of your lifespan and aging,  and <em>then</em> check out your insidey bits for some biology lessons.
<p></p>Overall as a practice,  vivisecting aliens is just wasteful and silly.
