            Maybe Celestia and Luna (and maybe some of their old friends) had to go on an epic quest to find the Elements.

            Yeah,  I figured that Luna and Celestia each wielded more than one element. Just by virtue of the fact that they're alicorns,  but as a trade off,  they're overall ability to wield the elements isn't as potent (I take this from the line Celestia said about the cast harnassing the full power of the elements to purge Luna)

            I think Celestia and Luna can harness the Elements to their full effect,  but Celestia alone (or Luna alone but that hasn't happened) can't.

            @Sereg:  I had a theory along those lines awhile back.  I thought that the reason they were only able to imprison Luna and not save her was because they only had five element bearers,  and that four of them became those stars so that she could eventually be saved.

            I personally believe that Celestia's using the elements on Luna caused a serious rift severing Celestia from the elements and rendering them inert.

            Lurker: Yea,  true.
<p></p>I also subscribe to the same 3/3 split as Bad.
<p></p>My theory is that the Elements can be multi-wielded,  but because it's hard for a pony to strongly embody all six at once,  the Elements are much weaker when only one pony wields them (Celestia vs Nightmare Moon) compared to when six ponies who each embody their primary Element in an exceptional way work together,  which brings out the true power of the Elements.  I imagine the power with Celly and Luna each tri-wielding would be more skewed toward the six pony side,  rather than sitting right in the middle between one and six ponies,  though.

            It does make sense that Celestia and Luna both had three elements,  since they embody the three pony races.  I don't have a strong attachment to my theory,  but I would like to know what the deal with those four stars was.

            Again,  I always figured that Celestia didn't IMMEDIATELY use the elements because she figured that they wouldn't work with only her wielding them. Cue fight between Celestia and NM. When it was over,  and Tia literally had no other choice left,  she tried to use the elements. To her surprise,  Luna's elements were faintly glowing too. NM herself recoiled in surprise at that,  enough to allow Tia to fire. Celestia then tried to purge Luna,  but it just wouldn't completely work. She'd be able to partially cleanse her,  but then the hatred and anger would slowly begin to slip back into Luna's voice after a few seconds. Realising she had no other choice,  Tia sealed her sis away.
<p></p>That's just how I imagined it (shrug)

<p></p>Why?  What did cute widdle Megan ever do to <em>you?</em>
<p></p>Personally Megan is one of the few things I liked from G1 Canon... though,  I hated how they gave her a more "girly" outfit in the movie and TV series (as opposed to the leather jacket,  blue jeans and cowboy boots she wore in the original "Midnight Castle" pilot).
<p></p>...
<p></p>And <em>sigh</em>,  I'm stuck again on a "Surprise Days" story that involves Discord.  It again raises the question of whether I even <em>want</em> him to be a part of my fanfic's canon,  or if I should just edit out the two stories that <em>do</em> feature him.
