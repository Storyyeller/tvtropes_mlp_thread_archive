            Although given that ponies typically have higher top speed and endurance,  one has to wonder if they'd generally bother learning to ride.

            anyway,  time for a fanfic report!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Dear Thread Manor...
<p></p>We've got a nice variety of fics today! some crossover,  some AU,  a little slice of life,  and even a bit of romance! This is kinda a big one,  not because there's lots of stories,  but because the synopsis' are kinda long!
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/68128/three-hundred-and-fifty">Three Hundred and Fifty<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>- in progress. Rarity and the rest of the girls are shocked when a trip to the hospital after mysteriously fainting reveals that Sweetie Belle has a congenital heart defect and likely won't live more than a few months. The girls all react differently,  in particularly,  Twi begins looking for a solution,  even though the doctor says that modern medicine can't do anything for her. However,  despite intensive searching,  Twi finds that the doctor was right,  modern medicine cannot save Sweetie. But that doesn't stop Twilight. If modern medicine cannot save Sweetie,  then certainly <em>future</em> medicine will be able to save her! Twilight creates a time machine and she and Sweetie travel 350 years into the future where medical technology is able to save Sweeties life. Unfortunately,  it seems Twilight's creation was a one way trip. Celestia tells her that they never returned to their own time,  and everypony agrees that you can't change the past. But once again,  Twilight's not going to let something like that stop her...
<p></p>This is a pretty neat story. a vision of future equestria that is still quite peaceful and harmonious and Twi trying to break causality.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/71660/a-mighty-demon-slayer-grooms-some-ponies">A Mighty Demon Slayer Grooms Some Ponies<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>- in progress. With the reopening of the Rainbow Bridge,  Celestia decides to open ties with humanity. What better first contact than a human who already knows about ponies,  a human who was essential in ponies having a future,  who helped vanquish numerous demons and monsters to keep ponies safe in ages past? They decide the best way to introduce themselves would be to enter into a competitive horse show. Now it's up to Megan to make sure the girls are all presentable by human standards...
<p></p>this is kinda interesting because Megan is actually kinda bitter about all the shit she went through in G1 when she was just a kid. oh,  and you can learn a thing or two about horse grooming/styling,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">the author has done thier research.</a>
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/61802/foal-necromancer">Foal Necromancer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>- in progress. A necromancer of immense power who's been alive for over 170 years is tired of people constantly hounding him and trying to kill him. You see,  he's not evil. He was born with this power,  he never asked for it. He's only ever killed in self defense. The only reason people are trying to kill him is because he insulted a very important person when he was a child,  and things snowballed from there and he's now the most wanted man in the entire realm. Various groups have succeeded in killing him before,  of course,  but that kind of thing doesn't stop a necromancer of his power for very long. This time however,  turned out differently. This party of adventurers,  instead of killing him,  managed to knock him into a portal with no end destination. No matter,  he knows he'll still come back to life,  just somewhere else. What he doesn't expect is to wake up to find himself as a small foal with wings and a horn in a world populated by talking horses. And he definitely never would have expected the local goddess of the night to adopt him as her son. How will he adapt to a world where it seems that no one is trying to kill him for what he is? What if his constant paranoia actually isn't misguided?
<p></p>I know this sounds kinda mary sueish,  and I gotta admit,  it kinda is. But it's still pretty enjoyable to read despite that.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/57069/a-little-justice-on-the-side">A Little Justice on the Side<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>- in progress. Side stories for <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/32692/Justice-Itself">Justice Itself<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  on of my favorite crossover fics. What kind of shenanigans does pony!Tyrael get up to while living in Ponyville?
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/51991/flash-fog">Flash Fog<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>- in progress. An industrial accident in Cloudsdale sends a bank of construction grade clouds rolling along the ground towards Ponyville. Fluttershy,  who once got a certification as a fog specialist in order to get a tax write off on her ground based home,  suddenly finds herself put in charge of handling the situation by the Department of Weather. Can Fluttershy,  with the support of her friends,  handle the burdens of leadership and resolve the situation?
<p></p>some light comedy/adventure with Fluttershy at the helm!
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/59705/pony-and-prejudice">Pony and Prejudice<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Can a pony and a changeling truly love eachother? This particular pony and changeling couple know that yes,  they can,  because they do love eachother. But can they convince the princesses of this? Will they have the support of the law to protect them against racism and bigotry by their own kind?
<p></p>just a warning,  his story has a bit of a twist at the end. it wasn't handled completely terribly or anything but,  well,  I've seen better...still worth a read since it's only 4k ish words.
<p></p>That's all for now! Of this batch,  I'd actually ay that Foal Necromancer was my favorite. It appeals to my love of high fantasy. Hope you all found something interesting! until next time!

            You know something I noticed? Pony's tend to forget that they hardly ever wear clothes for the sake of a joke. First there was Rarity in The Best Night Ever,  then there was Fluttershy in the Flim-Flam bros episode. These little ponys must have amnesia or something.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>Also,  I am really pumped for the new episode tommorow,  I mean holy crap.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_surprised.png" height="16" width="16" alt="surprised" title="surprised">
