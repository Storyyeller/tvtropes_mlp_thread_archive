            If the mane six tried to start their own children's television programs I wonder how things would go.  Do you think they'd initially bicker over what content they thought was best,  or would they collaborate from the start?  I can easily see them bickering,  but I think it'd be great if they all were to collaborate at the start rather than thrust their ideas upon each other in that scenario.

            @ Ginger: Basically he was a villain the whole time (longer than Robotnik was during that game) then at the end he helped you fight a dinosaur spaceship and died.
<p></p>@ Purple: I liked Sonic Adventure. Whether that's some nostalgia or not I don't know.

            BTW,  with the Cadance was the foal sitter for Twilight,  Shining Armour being able to marry a princess,  Twilight never having to worry for funds and that she was allowed to try out for the most prestigious magic academy in Equestria yet could only perform basic telekinesis. How likely is it that Twilight is from a noble house? A really high up noble house.
