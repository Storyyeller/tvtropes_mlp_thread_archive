            @ Kegi,  no more like she's the one that would be most comfortable talking about sex as an abstract,  or about other ponies having it,  but she would still be completely overwhelmed at the thought actually doing anything.

            @ ginger,  well seeing as how,  even if we are basically talking about sexuality as pertaining to cartoon ponies,  it's pretty much all about them personality wise,  which is actually quite the accomplishment on the creators part to create characters with such realistic and well formed personalities that we're able to do...
<p></p>also the whole topic is focused on there sexuality,  not about them as an object of sexuality,  and it's completely SSC,  I'd say no
<p></p>also,  yeah but where I differ is I see her losing that shyness once she actually gets going and becoming a wild thing. Then being horribly embarrassed afterward.

            Nah,  we're not horrible. This is pretty tmae,  all told - we're not even using them as objects like when we talk about bust sizes.
<p></p>My count for smut consumption goes something like this:
<p></p>Twilight: Erotic fanfiction,  with maybe a bit of fanart thrown in for good measure
<p></p>AJ: a few issues of Playfilly
<p></p>Dash: A new playfilly every three or four months. And a few,  extremely well-hidden issues of playcolt.
<p></p>Rarity: dimestore trash novel. No word on which perspective she appreciates more,  but she has lent <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercilessShipper" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercilessShipper">Fluttershy a book now and then...</a>
<p></p>Pinkie: A few magazines of both,  maybe a video or two. But more likely to just hop out to a bar if she ever gets horny.
<p></p>Fluttershy: A single,  old issue of playfilly,  with the occasional dimestore trash novel. She's more into those for the romance than the actual smut,  though.

            @ginger,  all depends on how taboo or risque the topic of sex IS in pony culture,  given how open and honest everything else is,  I doubt there's really that big a deal for them.

            @ the handsome stallion question-
<p></p>Twilight-Be extremely awkward or be blurting out embarrassing things and just getting redder and redder in the face.
<p></p>Applejack-Being taken quite quickly but being cautious,  feeling out his personality
<p></p>Rainbow-Putting the moves on him pretty quick
<p></p>Rarity-Same
<p></p>Fluttershy-Too shy to say anything
<p></p>Pinkie-The same way she reacts to everything,  though she probably remarks on his looks while she's talking and then starts to blush.

            Yeah... pony society strikes me as enlightened enough that sex is just sex to them. It's fun,  and it's where foals come from. Hooray!
<p></p>That said,  how the talk done went...
<p></p>Aj's was probably fairly simple,  maybe sort of old fasioned. Pinkie's was probably even <em>more</em> conservative than AJ's,  if anypony's was. Fluttershy probably clammed up for the entire thing,  so red in the face you'd think she was a tomato. Dash... for some reason I can't really see it. I would think she would just be bored by having to sit there for it. Given Rarities parents it would have probalby been astoundingly embarassing for her,  and Twilight... learned it from health class? Read it in a book? Depending on how close she was to her parents during her school years (I imagine she still lived with them,  I should hope) they probably told her the basics and she looked into the rest on her own. She was probably pretty curious about it,  though,  so maybe it turned into a Q+A period?

<p></p>Anyway,  I approve of the discussion that's been going on.  Admittedly,  I skipped the past two pages,  but I'm glad to see that we haven't had anyone talking about how horrible we are (<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndZoidberg" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndZoidberg">except Mousa</a>).  Damnit,  we're adults,  and we can handle adult matters like adults (yo dawg).
<p></p>^^That was the general consensus Ginger and I came to,  I think.

            I suppose there's a change the school might have been a boparding school,  but... Well,  I really don't like to think that Twilight started to distance herself from her parents at all. I like to imagine she sends them letters much more frequently than she sends Celestia letters.

            Orion and Dazzler are Canterlot citizens,  though,  aren't they?  Twilight could have taken to boarding at the Keep as she got older,  easily.  In the absence of conflicting information,  I'd guess that Twilight started boarding when her studies reached college-level.
