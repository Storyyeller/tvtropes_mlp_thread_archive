            As I said,  my veiw is that Cadance is a demi-alicorn and that she <em>does</em> have the powers of all three types of pony at a greater level than ordinary ponies (planetary level),  <em>does</em> age slower than ordinary ponies (about ten times slower) and has power over a concept (love in her case). Full alicorns like Celestia and Luna are <em>even more</em> powerful and age <em>even slower</em>.
<p></p>I call the alicorn of Hearts and Hooves Day Princess Cornucopia and consider her to have been the alicorn of harvests and was associated with Saturn,  just as Cadance is associated with Venus. Previous alicorns of Venus have included: Venus,  Cupid,  Eros,  Morning Star,  Imperatrix, Aphrodite,  etc.
<p></p>Chrysalis is the equivalent of an alicorn (specifically,  their highest ranking alicorn) for the changelings and every sapient race has their own equivalent.
<p></p>But this is all just my headcanon.

            But that's the beauty of headcanon,  Sereg! Because it's never been touched upon,  you can spout it as much as you want!
<p></p>Like,  my headcanon on the nature of the princesses would make Cadence a sort of Old Soul in-training. Or Divine Old Soul in training,  at least. She's sort of taking over the aspect of love from Chrysalis,  in fact - a former Divine Old Soul who had a very,  very unfortunate altercation with another of the Divine council some time in the past. Chrysalis was the victim in the event,  which left her citizens as the changelings they are now,  so she was allowed to remain while the other Divine was forced to let their soul back into The Flow,  but the damage was pretty severe. Chrysalis was effectively cut off from the general flow of love,  but she managed to keep her citizens alive through their love of her. the changelings feeding on love is effectively a cheat - if love is given to them Chrys can still use it to keep them all alive. Without it she runs out of power and the changelings die. And she can't switch dominions because that means giving up her power,  which means they die.
<p></p>She started nice enough,  but after several millenia she became ruthless for the sake of keeping her changelings alive.

            @Kegi: Ah,  yes. Interesting. I have heard you discuss the way Equestria works before a bit. My headcanon is different,  but I still find yours interesting.
<p></p>Another piece of my headcanon that I don't think I've mentioned is that in Equestrian Earth,  the title of King or Queen can only be taken by the ruler of an entire race. Celestia and Luna don't rule the ponies outside the borders of Equestria,  so they are not eligible for the title of Queen. Before the events of Hearth's Warming Eve,  though,  every unicorn was ruled by the unicorn King (I like the fanon name King Silver for him).

            Interesting bit of Fanon there,  Sereg. Me,  I just believe Luna and Celestia agreed to share the title of Princess since they would co-rule.

I hope that's the case,  because I was wishing that there was a white Celestia doll that was closer in size to the others and not just the big version,  since I mainly like to just get the Playful Ponies size dolls with the brushable hair because I prefer them being the same size (as a set) and I like the ones with the hair because their heads are moveable.</div>

<p></p>Again,  if I do disappear suddenly,  it's because my brother is in the same room as me,  and his reaction to when I told him I watched the first two episodes is enough to ensure he doesn't find out there's even a Season 3.
