            Ginger,  they focus on that because bullying an obviously fragile and apologetic character to tears is probably the worst thing that Gilda did in the episode.  I get that people overstate it by treating it as a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>,  but that doesn't mean that isn't still a really nasty thing for her to do.  And in all honesty,  complaining about fans occasionally latching onto one event sounds just a <em>bit</em> hypocritical,  considering that you've done the same thing just as,  if not more,  often.

            I also think it gets brought up because it was used as a turning point in the episode itself. It was the point where Pinkie stopped being able to rationalize what Gilda was doing,  and so it sticks in peoples' minds,  even though she arguably does much worse before and after.

            @kuroi: I haven't any ideas,  just wondering if I missed discussions about her due to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreadHop" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreadHop">Thread Hop</a>-ping. I can try to think of something because it bugs me when the mother isn't mentioned when both parents are missing. Especially since we have <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent">Promotion To Parent</a> going on with Derring.

            You're right. I just wish we could talk about Gilda without someone bringing up the Fluttershy scene. I don't even think she did it out of sadism. She seemed genuinely annoyed at her.
<p></p>What's worse: Sadistically scaring an old aged pensioner
<p></p>or Becoming excessively angry at someone who bumped into you? (yes,  I know Fluttershy apologized)

It's about a family of crytozologists tracking down cryptid like biggfoot,  the loch ness monster etc. There's a season 2 episode called the "Thousand Eyes of Ahuizotl" and features the title character prominently. Apparently in addistion to having a hand on the end of his tail he also likes to steal people's eyes. I'd link to the episode but I can't find it anywhere online.

<p></p>Crowind: Yea.  I know Daring's dad showing up without the mother might imply to some people that the mother died.  We could try to run with that or maybe find some way to avert it (maybe she got injured and can't adventure anymore?).

            Nah,  it's because of her Damsel Syndrome so she doesn't go on any more adventures because the odds of her being taken hostage <em>again</em> are too great and too annoying and stressful to her.

            @Ace: So...why doesn't she go back home and take care of her children instead?
<p></p>@Kuroi: we can say that she's dead,  and that's why the father is too ashamed to come home or something. Which is borderline over-dramatic to me but that seems to roll with the genre,  so. Either way all the children will have issues about it.

The reason I ask in the first place was because I thought Derring,  and to a lesser extent Daring,  would have a boatload of mother issues.

            Mama Do had a weak heart after too many stressful adventures,  so she's mostly bedridden and Derrin takes care of the family while dad earns money from adventuring? Also there might have been a noodle incident she doesn't like to talk about that weakened her a lot,  perhaps?

<p></p>The idea is that Momma and Daddy Do went MISSING. Leaving Derring to raise her siblings all by herself
<p></p>I built her entire character around that. You can't just take it away from me. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">
