            @Cookoo: I don't know. We've kind of een discssing them,  so as long as you don't say where they come from,  should be fine I guess.
<p></p>@Ginger: I was wondering,  what do you think of Tick Tock? I thought that you might not like her. Personally,  I do,  but I thought that you wouldn't.
<p></p>And RELAX. It's not a crime to be slow,  or I'd be arrested. As I said,  reading is one of the few things I <em>don't</em> do at a snail pace.
<p></p>EDIT: @Storyyeller: Unlike Time Lords,  Chronomancer seems to be an occupation rather than a species,  so I'd guess not. (So fairly similar to my own version of Time Ponies).

            Anyway,  knew Pinkie was going to be the hardest to corrupt (rolls eyes)
<p></p>I'm assuming that Rarity was Curacao uring that whole "Flathoof is just like Big Mac" conversation she had with AJ. Curacao is REALLY swiftly becoming my favourite member of the mean 6.
<p></p>Havoc is better at manipulation than I would've pegged her. Then again,  she is talking to FLUTTERSHY. (not sure how she's wrong either actually. Gargantuans ARE monsters)

            Naw actually Ginger,  I completely understand.  It's like when people start talking about the Legend of Korra and I'm totally lost.
<p></p>I'm not gonna read Crysis: Equestria.  After all I've never even played <em>Crysis</em> so I wouldn't enjoy it.  The same reason I don't read <em>Fallout: Equestria</em> (that and the premise just isn't that interesting IMO.  Not unless Rainbow Dash goes around hoofing people and saying "<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FistOfTheNorthStar">You are already dead</a>").
<p></p>Hey Ginger I forget,  did I link you to a video of one of my attempts to beat <em>Contra: Hard Corps</em>?  I think I did but I was so out of it,  I could have been dreaming.

            Yeah,  Havocwing <em>is</em> better at manipulation than I'd expect.
<p></p>As for "Flathoof is just like Big Mac",  that's something I thought the instant the fic introduced him. At first I thought that they were AU counterparts until it became apparent that there don't seem to be AU counterparts.

            Yeah saw the Flathoof=Big Mac thing instantly. And it's not so much pinkie is incorruptable,  it's just her...unique... psychology makes her immune to Velvet's usual method's. Any of the others might be able o do something.
<p></p>Oddly the ones I like to see interacting the most is RD and Greyscale. But I'll agree Curacao is the most interesting of the mean 6.

            I don't think it's even based on the comic book Crisis evnts,  the only thing even similar between them is the existance of multiple universes.
<p></p>no,  Starlight Shadow I could see as Azula,  Red Velvet is just fucking psycho.

<p></p>The ponies hate her so much that I can't bring myself to dislike her. She's certainly not perfect.
<p></p>And for that matter I don't find Velvet all that scary either. She's made to look too falable (by <em>Pinkie</em>) for me to take her seriously
