            It seems like it could be a flashback Twilight is seeing in person? The Luna in it could easily be referring to Celestia instead,  and the throne room looked a lot more like the castle in the Everfree than the palace in Canterlot.
<p></p>Also,  I may be mistaken but it looked like,  for a moment,  Luna was <em>surprised</em> by the black that surrounded her.

<p></p>I'm really happy too. My mother was disabled and I really like the idea.
<p></p>Also,  Nightmare Moon flashback! Yay! Though,  the adherence to canon for my fanverse is likely to diminish rapidly at this point. I'm happy anyway though.
<p></p>Who caught the names of the Power Ponies and which was who?

            I know that Applejack was Madam Marvelous(Or something like that. Looks like a Wonder Woman expy,  but could be Mary Marvel,  or Miss Marvel,  or whatever her name is. I'm not so up on Marvel stuff.)
<p></p>I think Dash was called Zap,  or something?

<p></p>Oh,  and I guess more Equestria Games episodes too,  since the plot is apparently Scoots wanting to be the Ponyville Flag Bearer.

            If they do a flashback episode,  I hope they do more than just when Celestia fought Nightmare Moon. Perhaps a scene with them as little fillies or dealing with Discord.

            They could be scene numbers,  too. The climbing number beside it is the shot number,  it looks like,  so they'd need a way of ordering the scenes as well.
<p></p>That said,  the Nightmare Moon one being episode 1 would make a lot of sense.

            I wonder about the sisters episode. This'll be the first time the expanded universe will have some clear ties to the show's continuity,  asuming they keep the names,  which I think they will. Now I wouldn't be surprised if the book was written to tie in with season 4.

            That's what I mean,  whatsisgame. Those are production mumbers,  but I don't know they're episode counters. I learned about shot numbers when I was taught storyboarding,  but we never did anything longer than a single scene. So for all I know they set scene numbers too. There didn't seem to be more than one scene per clip.
<p></p>I doubt there's as many as 400 scenes to an episode,  though,  so you're probably right. Just offering another opinion.

            It would certainly be interesting if Celestia and Luna showed Twilight the ropes by telling her about their experiences when they first started out.
<p></p>As for Scoots,  I'm fine with it as long as the disability doesn't dominate her character. I've never liked it when a character's role in the show is just "the disabled one".  Fortunately,  the writers are good enough not to fall into that.

            That'll certainly make sense. Buy the way,  Applelight,  it looks like you'll soon see <em>canon</em> earth pony superpowers. But I'll continue my list of legends. I'm actually enjoying it. And I'm glad that you liked the first three at least. I think I'll go add number ten now.
