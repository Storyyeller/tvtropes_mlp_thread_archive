            I didn't really like Over a Barrel. The first few scenes were great though! Watching Little <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongHeart" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongHeart">Strong Heart</a> and the other buffalo in action was great to watch! Yet once it came to Pinkie's song...it goes downhill for me. The final confrontation between the ponies and the buffalo felt rushed.

            I liked the Battle of Appleloosa. Even if there was technically no fatalities.
<p></p>Oh,  except for a pony who got knocked through a building. I don't think you see her again after,  so I just assumed she died in the battle.

            I liked it,  though I was constantly distracted by the thought that if this show wasn't so far down the idealism scale,  there's no way in hell it would end well for anybody.

            Eh,  I started assuming that around the middle of Season 2. Apple Family Reunion just cemented that headcanon.
<p></p>They both died in an industrial accident on the farm,  where a automated system caught fire and they were trapped in the barn. Not a pleasant way to go. That's why AJ always uses manual methods. That,  and the fact she's stronger than most machines.

            I liked that it was never really brought up. Asidefrom the fact that it's a touchy subject to bring up on a kids show,  it gave me the impression that nothing had to be said because they'd dealt with it some time ago though it's sad sometimes for AJ to think about.

<p></p>oh well,  that's because it <em>is</em> a part of a larger KH fanfic. Specifically,  the Annals of Darkness crossover series,  which is over 1 million words and can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1173812/Shire-Folk">on the authors ff.net account<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
<p></p>I haven't read it,  but I was still enjoying Guardians of Magic just fine.
