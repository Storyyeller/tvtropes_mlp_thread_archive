            Dragon Quest doesn't have the "Tolkien levels of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>" problem,  really. It's not about how bad dragons are,  and if it did have that as part of the summary (I think the applicable trope is <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>,  anyways) then it'd have Spike being bad because he's a dragon.
<p></p>The episode is about Spike learning the real meaning of family. The aforementioned complaint seems to me to be a case of not seeing the forrest for the trees. Or not seeing the forrest for the completely different forrest that doesn't actually exist.

            Exactly my problem with it! so much wasted potential and ultimately it seems to encourage Spike deciding to become a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot">Boomerang Bigot</a> against dragons, based on one group.
<p></p>That's not even counting Rarity and RD being assholes to Spike, which starts the whole thing.
<p></p>Family may be the intent, but overall it seemed to go "Ponies = Good",  "All Dragons except Spike = Bad"
<p></p>"Mare Do Well" was like the ATLA episode The Great Divide, anvilicious, characters bent out of shape for the plot, a moral that you can see a mile away, an interesting concept made mediocre, and unfunny.Oh yeah and very divisive because of it.

            Yeah,  I doubt that the deal was that all dragons are jerks. It's really more of a teenager thing than a dragon thing. Teenagers <em>are</em> awful in groups. This is a fact.
<p></p>Sure,  there could have been more world building in there,  but that would have subtracted from Spike's character development by taking the focus off of him and on to the mythology,  IMO. It's not like we didn't get any world building anyway. The fact that dragons migrate as a group in the first place is just cool,  and we got some neat details about phoenixes.

            @Lopiny I try not to hate any episode,  really. It's jsut that The Last Roundup touches topics that I'm not confortable with (I despise <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural">Police Procedural</a> series because of how many "torture the witness ntil he talks" scenes are present). Overall,  it just wasn't narrated well,  just like Mare-Do-Well.
<p></p>@Teeth Yeah,  I'm disappointed too that we don't learn anything on dragons culture (if they any of it,  that is; remember,  they come from the wild),  but seriously,  try to talk about that <em>and</em> Spike's story couldn't fit in only 22 minutes of episode. You needs a two-parter for all that.
<p></p>@terlwyth Nah,  they didn't want to be jerks with Spike,  they jsut finded it funny without realizing they were hurting him (it happens sometimes). And I don't think that Spike thinks that all dragons are jerkasses (dragon teenagers maybe,  but not fully grown dragons since he still didn't meet them).

            See this is what I mean, that's exactly what DQ needed, but maybe just a regular adult dragon. Maybe the one Fluttershy talked to for continuity sake.
<p></p>And yeah it would've been a good two-parter.
<p></p>I agree that The Last Roundup could've been told a little bit better, but it still had enough going for it. For example it did dig a little bit more into AJ, Pinkie was pretty hilarious this time rather than overdone (ex: A Friend In Deed) or <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter">Out of Character</a> for little reason (Mare Do Well), the torture was <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">Cool and Unusual Punishment</a>, the chase scene was good, really all that needed to happen was for them to be like "Aaaaahhh we have to go find Pinkie and Rarity"

Rarity had already planned to wed him before even meeting him personally,  with everything she knew about him easily summed up as "he's a prince". She was looking for a fairy tale romance,  but if you take a closer look you see that,  in those,  the prince is more of an entity than a character. Blueblood must get a lot of those,  and if he isn't simply a jerk,  he'd probably want to drive them away.
<p></p>Why am I defending a headcanon that I don't share,  I have no idea.
<p></p>And what Dragon Quest needed is less teenager stuff and more dragon stuff.

            @Perpetual: Thing is,  I don't think that Spike really got all that much character development either.  He wanted to find out what being a dragon means,  and I don't think he actually did.  He met one isolated group of dragons,  disliked them,  and decided that being a pony was better.  I think the episode failed to answer the question that it asked.

            @JT That was the point. The whole lesson was his discovery that <em>what</em> he is doesn't matter,  but <em>who</em> he is does. The question of what it means to be a dragon doesn't <em>have</em> an answer.

            @Perpetual: Even so,  it feels like a cop out to me because the episode basically set itself up to answer that question.  I can't quite put my finger on why,  but the conclusion just didn't feel satisfying.  I think it's because I feel like Spike didn't really develop or learn anything about himself other than "Wow,  I'm glad I'm a pony".  I guess it's just me. /*shrug*
