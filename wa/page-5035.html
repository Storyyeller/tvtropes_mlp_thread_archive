            @Ginger,  When it comes to say movie adaptations of books or anime versus manga,  then I would say yes. I do love movies though,  don't get me wrong,  film is always fantastic and wouldn't trade it's existence for anything else,  but there's something to be said for being able to choose your own pacing and not having a 2.5 hour time limit.
<p></p>And I agree Pannic,  losing Peeves was a sad day for the films.

            The change from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">squid monster</span> to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dr. Manhattan-based bombs</span> isn't the problem. The problem is that they took a very muted comic book and turned it into a stylized action flick. Also they ruined Ozymandias's characterization by making him obviously the villain.

<p></p>There are issues with the 3rd movie,  but I still think it was the best one,  just like it was the best book.

            Problem with the Harry Potter movies is the changes raise a handful of plotholes. For example,  in the fifth book,  Harry is able to see Thestrals for the first time because he witnesses Cedric Diggory's murder. Buuuut in the movies he already saw Quirrel's death. Because he kinda killed him. Which somewhat ruins the whole <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Technical Pacifist</a> thing he tends to have going for him.

            @Ginger,  oddly enough,  the 3rd book was my favorite,  well next to the fifth anyway.
<p></p>Never saw the films past 3,  fell asleep watching 4 and I didn't like the new visual style nor Flitwick and Dumbledore's replacements,  too angry and not enough whimsy.
