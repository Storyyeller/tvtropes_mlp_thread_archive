            At least Rainbow called her out on being Ca-razy. Though I kind of wish Pinkie had learned tha she doesn't always have to be a hyper little ball of random.

            Yeah,  I can sympathize with Cranky; he only exploded at Pinkie when she wouldn't leave him alone.  I mean,  she broke into his house and started wrecking everything and made him look ridiculous in front of the whole town.  I'd probably have been just as angry in that situation.

            Contrivance ahoy!  Man,  how many years was he searching?  Dude's lucky she didn't find someone else.  Glad Pinkie learned the right lesson from this,  and Cranky still gets annoyed with her even if he accepted being her friend.

The message of some people wish to be left alone so you shouldn't force yourself on them was what we hoped,  and Cranky had a legitimate reason to be upset with Pinkie,  instead of just being a compete jerk. Also,  alot of continuity,  between the baby cakes and Dash reading Daring do.
