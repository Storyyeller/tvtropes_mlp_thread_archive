            The way I see it,  AJ's inner conflict in <em>The Last Roundup</em> wasn't directly connected to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a>. It had nothing to do with her parents,  it was all about making a promise and then finding out you're not quite good enough to get it done.
<p></p>However,  I do think it may be <em>tangentially</em> connected. By which I mean not having parents around meant that she and Big Mac had to fend for themselves,  and then care for two other people on top of that. From this comes a strong sense of self-reliance,  which I believe results in AJ's "stubborn pride". But I don't think that label is quite accurate. I think it's more that because of her experiences,  Applejack's sense of self-worth is rooted in being able to accomplish things by her own hand (er,  hoof),  and being able to support other people. If she has to rely on someone else,  especially for something she really believes she should be able to do herself,  then she's failed,  big time.
<p></p>And part of her character development is learning that sometimes,  you <em>can't</em> do everything by yourself. Sometimes the job is too big for any one person to handle on their own. Sometimes things go wrong,  your plans fall to pieces,  and your efforts are all for naught. Sometimes,  you need to be strong enough to ask for help. As the saying goes,  that's what friends are for.

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Once we have a proper world map,  we can finally get started on Friendship is Magic: the RPG.</div>
<p></p>We've had several titled exactly that.  Of the two most notable,  one is a mess of hideously poor balance,  and the other is a poorly-optimized mess of overambition that results in clicking through pages and pages of laggy text to pick up basic supplies.  Both are incredibly tedious and make me seriously wonder if the programmer bothered playing through them beginning to end with the debug settings off.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">For whatever reason,  I've never been able to take the "epic" adventures as seriously as the ponies' personal struggles.</div>
<p></p>Yeah,  the grounding of FIM isn't the ambitious story,  it's when the ambitious story springs from the character.  Even among the more epic fics,  the ones that stick with me are the ones that just use it as a vehicle to tap into the ponies' heads.

            Here's a question:
<p></p>Which of the mane six would like 'attention',  and which wouldn't?
<p></p>For me,  RD,  Rarity and Pinkie would like it (so long as they don't cross lines)...AJ and Fluttershy wouldn't...and twilight could go either way.

            Well it looks like I underestimated you,  then. I just saw a bit of a freakout over there,  and I thought I'd warn you. Sorry about that.
<p></p>Also,  I think AJ would tend to ignore the attention unless it got excessive,  instead of actively avoiding it.

            I don't like idea Parental Abandonment just like dead parents.  And it's also dont explain why there is no AJ parents in CMC flashback even if them missing should after AB was born. And there is nothing suggesting  Apple Bloom was on this world at time  AJ got her CM.

            With Rarity,  I think she would largely ignore the 'whistling construction workers',  would not without being secretly flattered.  Like she'd confidently trot past with her head held high and a smug smile in her face.  I base this on what we saw in SRB.
