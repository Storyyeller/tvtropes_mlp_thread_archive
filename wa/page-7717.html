            Hello guys! I'm probably going to read a bit more of CRISIS today. I've only read the first chapter,  which isn't enough to form a good opinion on it yet. It looks OK so far though.

            @Ginger: Yeah,  their interaction is kind of interesting despite how little Greyscale talks. It's like they know that Greyscale doesn't need to put effort into being cool. She just is.
<p></p>Also,  has anyone read <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24827/Transdimensional-Zoology">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>? It's pretty interesting and the arrogance of the naration makes it hilarious. I hope that the author continues it. For those who want to know what it's about before clicking <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Opal,  Rarity's cat dreams of a world where she and the other pets are ponies,  or is Opal the unicorn dreaming of a world where her friends are all pets,  or are both worlds real (as appears mos likely should the story continue).</span>

            See here's the issue,  your ONLY talking about in combat,  you can "relay" on somepony simply being there,  without having to acknowledge it blatantly. She relies on all her friends to simply be there and be themselves,  any of them missing would throw some part of the group off. but the connections between them are so many,  and so subtle that you can't just point to ONE thing and say that is it.
