            now I can totally see them just making Alicorn version just for the toys,  or maybe the 66 minute DVD is some special where it happens,  but the Reset Button gets pushed at the end.

            See,  if I were in that position and they told me to make Twilight an Alicorn. I'd do it.

<p></p>Work sent me home again. I have acquired a large sack of Vitamin C,  Nighttime cold meds and cough suppressants. I am <em>going</em> to kick the shit out of this thing so I can get back to work tomorrow,  and failing that I'm at least going to <em>fake</em> it.
<p></p>you know what really bugs me about this? When I was living in Manitoba I had this chronic cough in the winter time. I was hemming pretty much constantly,  and it tended to kick up at sudden changes of temperature - walking in,  or outside. It cleared up while I was in Vancouver,  but I can't help but wonder if that was just due to the fact that it never got as cold or dry there as it does here... if that turns out to be the case,  I'm going to have to convince the management that it's chronic and non-contagious,  which will be SO much fun,  as my cough has been described as 'disturbing'.

            I still like my idea that Tia and Luna were normal ponies,  that got turned into Alicorns but the Elements when they used them against Discord. the reason the Mane 6 didn't was there are 6 of them not 2 so the power was diffused enough not to change them immediately,  but they COULD do so if they wanted to.

            Yeah,  it the Elements are powered by emotions,  6 ponies are still stronger than 2 Princesses in terms of emotional energy.

            no no,  not saying the ELEMENTS weren't more powerful,  simply that the mane 6 using them had less power flow back into them,  each only having 1 elements worth getting connected to them,  while Tia and Luna each had three.

            I subscribe to the theory that the two sisters working together,  each with three Elements,  were able to wield them at about their full power (evidence: the Sisters and the Mane <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SIx" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SIx">S Ix</a> were able to do the exact same thing to Discord with them).
<p></p>However,  when Luna became Nightmare Moon,  Celestia was made to use the elements by herself. Since the Elements spring from,  and represent,  unity between different people,  a single person trying to use them,  no matter how powerful she is,  could not use them at their full power. Evidence: The Mane Six were able to clenase Luna of her dark powers and bring her back to normal,  whereas Celestia could only banish her. I think that's why she set up the idea to groom Twilight into someone who could use them,  because banishing Luna again would be tantamount to giving up on her sister,  and that was something she could not do.

            I have a similar theory to Enlong.  Except I went with power based on the harmony of the users.  Two sisters who are very close would have a pretty good chance of balanced harmony between them.  Six tightly-knit friends would have even better odds of maintaining it by cancelling out each others' weaknesses.  One pony will generally always have some sort of turmoil going on (and for Celly,  especially so given the circumstances),  therefore all but the most zen of the zen wouldn't be able to use the elements' full power while alone.

            @Enlong and Kuroi: Pretty much how I feel about them as well.  The elements are designed to coordinate the power of multiple ponies,  so soloing them wouldn't work.  My theory about Celestia's solo use is that it only worked because half of them were still linked to Luna; Celestia could activate them,  but because Luna was misaligned they didn't work at 100% efficiency and she got moon'd rather than purified.  If Luna had become completely unaligned with the elements,  I don't think Celestia could have imprisoned her,  at least not using the elements.
<p></p>Also,  this is kind of an old question,  but in light of new info,  I'm curious: if we assume the elements were split 3/3 between them,  who got what?

            It's funny how the Chaos Emeralds also restore order by consuming Chaos,  but they only need a single user to tap their power unlike the Elements of Harmony.

            My unlikely headcanon is that Celestia had help,  and that the Elements are always 1:1 with their weilders. I'd personally peg Celestia as Laughter first and foremost,  but I'm not sure of what the other two would be if she wielded three.
