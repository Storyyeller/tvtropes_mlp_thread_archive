            @Bag: I ease the pain by inserting my own morals. MDW? Everyone can have fame go to their head,  even the well intentioned - Twi and the girls got sort of insufferable in their own right. FPK? When you test a hypothesis,  don't set out to prove yourself right or someone else wrong. Test the theory objectively and separate yourself from the experiment (SCIENCE!)

<p></p>You mean that,  in the real world,  if you met somebody who had the demonstrable ability to consistently and factually predict the future,  it would be stupid to believe in it?  Even when all scientific evidence points towards it being legit?

            I'm pretty sure she knows she's not actually the best; she's never once claimed to be better than the Wonderbolts,  and she readily accepts that she needs more practice to join them.  I like Dashie a lot for that,  actually - her confidence is largely a facade without her friends supporting her,  and she needs them to be as loyal as she is.
<p></p>As for FPK,  which I really,  really don't want to discuss again,  suffice to say that Twilight was not conducting scientific experiments by any definition of the phrase and should be ashamed of herself for distorting the scientific method like that.

            I never really got the problem that Twilight was being punished for following the scientific method in Feeling Pinkie Keen because she wasn't following the scientific method. If she was she would have at least entertained the possibility that her hypothesis was wrong after the multitude of evidence that proves it to be wrong. Instead she says that no,  that evidence doesn't count because she cannot be wrong.

            Yeah,  Twilight's problem wasn't that she was examining Pinkie Sense scientifically,  it's that she was examining it scientifically <em>and ignoring the evidence in favor of her own bias</em>.  No one is saying that Twilight needed to believe that Pinkie Sense was real just because Pinkie says so.  The Scientific Method,  loosely defined is "let's examine the the hypothesis and see if it's true or not".  Twilight didn't do that.  Her take was "I already know this is false and I'm going to look for evidence that proves me right."

            @Bad: Pretty much my thoughts on it. The moral in and of itself was valid,  but the lesson I took from it was less "Believe in something without knowing how it works,  and don't try to understand it",  and more "Be a good scientist goddammit".
<p></p>As for Dash,  she does admit that she needs practice,  but she doesn't act like it. She still struts about like a peacock,  and the average onlooker could be forgiven for seeing her as arrogant. She's more honest with her friends,  but the rest of the world get's the "look at me" front. Again,  she likes attention. Craves it. The more people looking,  the better. When they're her friend she understands she doesn't need to be perfect to keep them around,  but the crowds? She's gotta be the best,  and if she isn't she's gotta act the part. Dash is actually pretty similar to Trixie in that regard - she's a performer. She's gotta strut her stuff for the crowds,  even if it's all lights and sounds. Gotta believe your 10 feet tall and farting thunderbolts if you're gonna make it in the performing world. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Trixie/dash is my new ship now,  by the way.</span>

<p></p>Yeah; Dash is actually rather like Pinkie in that sense.  She's an extreme extrovert and a lot of her self-confidence is entirely dependent on how other people see her and treat her.

            @Nomuru: That song... sounds alright I guess.  I'm not a big fan of the theme song anyway,  so not particularly interested in a full length of it.  It felt about the same as the official one to me.  Oh,  and the beginning was full on <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes">Tastes Like Diabetes</a>.

See,  Mousa?  I told you we could bash Dash and Pinkie on the same basis as Rarity!
<p></p>Now Twilight I like to bash for being so hilariously full of contempt.

            Yeah,  that's mostly why I like the thought of it. They'd despise each other <em>so much</em> it'd be hilarious. But if they ever got over it it might be interesting. They could support each other really well if they ever actually learned to respect each other,  because if someone they respected payed attention to them...
<p></p>It would be like an old nag sort of thing. They'd bitch and moan and argue,  but they'd do it because they loved each other,  and in the privacy of their home they might actually be a bit sweet to one another.
<p></p>But yes,  Dash and Pinkie are remarkable similar. In fact,  I'd call Dash a slightly more advanced Pinkie. She still craves that attention,  and fears being alone,  but she at least knows she doesn't have to be perfect in front of her friends. Which honestly gives credence to that ship as well,  since they could support one another. Shame Pinkie Twi is so much cuter.

            ^It's not really something to bash people about; some people can self-validate,  and others can't.  It doesn't make you objectively better than someone else to be able to get by without knowing that people like you.
