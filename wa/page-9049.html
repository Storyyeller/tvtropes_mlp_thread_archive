            But it's the dramatic and thematic heart of the show. And it has some of the best songs in the show - "No More, " "No One Is Alone, " and "Children Will Listen."

<p></p>Waaaaaaaaat. But doesn't that like,  remove the entire <em>point</em> of Into The Woods? That's worse than the junior version of Avenue Q,  at least they kept the plot intact,  even if they removed any highschoolers chance of singing about the noises they make while having sex.

            Yeah.
<p></p>I mean,  "high school" and "junior" versions of shows tend to be a bit iffy in general. Sometimes it's something that's so inoffensive that the act of trimming just makes it less enjoyable (Annie,  Guys &amp; Dolls),  but there are cases where it's valid. <em>Les Miserables</em> has a decent high school edition,  and there are similar cases with <em>Sweeney Todd, </em> <em>Miss Saigon, </em> and <em>Rent, </em> but at least those,  to the best of my knowledge,  don't gut it. They just make it into something that's manageable for a younger audience to perform.
<p></p>But the <em>Into the Woods</em> Junior version... ugh. And while we mention it,  yeah,  <em>Avenue Q</em> is a show that shouldn't have gotten that treatment in the first place at all.
<p></p>As for Into the Woods,  yeah,  a number of the characters are assholes. But the ones who don't die are fairly likable,  and the ending is hopeful. It's not as cynical as some of Sondheim's other stuff. Now,  back to my list...

            There are some musicals that have had productions filmed (as opposed to movie adaptations). This include Sweeney Todd,  Sunday in the Park with George,  Rent,  Passing Strange,  Into the Woods,  Passion,  and many,  many more. You can get these on dvd,  and <em>Into the Woods</em> in particular is available for instant watch on Netflix.
<p></p>The thing with the <em>Into the Woods Jr.</em> version is that not only does it contain a handful of Bowlderizations,  but it completely removes the second act. That's not censorship,  that's leaving out half of the story.

            It's an operetta about a band of ne'er-to-do-well pirates. Mainly the plot concerns Frederic,  who was apprenticed to the famed Pirates of Penzance until his twenty-first birthday. Well,  he's twenty-one now,  and he confesses that although they are all dear friends of his,  he has resolved to join the side of the law and exterminate them. He then falls in love with Mabel,  daughter of the Modern Major-General Stanley.
<p></p>Also includes a squad of cowardly police officers.

Jeez,  the dude gets <em>one</em> song where he kills himself,  and people think he's some suicidal emo person.
<p></p>...
<p></p>Random mental image: Some dude manages to kill himself twice.
