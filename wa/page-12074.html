            Then again,  Twilight wouldn't have to be an alicorn to punch in the same weight class as one.  I mean,  Sombra did,  and he wound up causing enough trouble for <em>two</em> alicorns that they had to pull a Wind Waker on him <em>and</em> his entire innocent dominion.

            Personally,  I'm hoping "the next level!!!" will be high-end tutoring from Luna.  Because 1) Twilight gets even more OP,  and 2) Luna.
<p></p>I get the feeling Nightmare Moon really was just her going nuts on her own (and Lauren's basically said as much).  But my crazy headcanon theory I wish was true is that it was a leftover from Discord that went around possessing ponies,  Luna volunteered to bait it so Celestia could zap it cleanly and getting banished to the moon was Luna's own contingency to buy time if it went wrong — but she got mindscrewed and tempted while under the influence until she was actually going along with it on her own,  attacked Celestia full force,  and she feels too guilty about that to let Celestia tell anyone that she was really the hero.
<p></p>See,  the thing that bugs me about Luna just going nuts on her own is that before all that she'd seen some shit.  Like,  this is two villains now that she's on the record stopping,  and while we don't know when Discord happened,  Sombra would have been banished around the same time as herself.  Supposedly she would've been a hero right then.

            My headcanon on Nightmare Moon was that it was just Luna on her own. Nothing else was influencing her,  it was her own mistake.
<p></p>Anywho I'm theorising that fragments of King Sombra will show up throughout the series,  will be locked away so as to not be misused and when the last one is locked away they'll combine back into him.

            So basically seasons 3-6 are all reusing the same set of Sombra-chunks with a different villain?
<p></p>Wait wait,  let's be fair,  it'd be 3,  5,  and 7,  because we'd get interlude seasons with G1 villains and a giant floating head.
