            We really do need a doujinshi law.  I mean,  pretty much every single piece of unlicensed fanart,  animation,  plushies,  etc. breaks the same trademark laws,  but there's so much explicit approval and even patronization from the staff there that the lawyers don't dare go after it.
<p></p>Hell,  just about every third thing that shows up in the fimfiction feature box is better than a good deal of published fiction (which...well,  says more about the standards of published fiction than anything,  but there's a lot of actual gems in there too),  but fanfiction's just become this monolith that nobody wants to touch.

            Well.. if there are Rockstar ponies and they tour Equestria and other lands...
<p></p>At least we'd get to see more worldbuilding...
<p></p>But that's only assuming that some of the other pony team works with them to keep things in universe.

            I'd love to see them do the show but rather than the typical pop/punk band they go in a totally different direction and have prog ponies or something.

            I would probably like a music-themed spinoff,  given that I like to sing and listen to music myself.  I'm also pretty easy to please when it comes to music as well,  I don't think there really are any musical styles that I dislike.  I've liked all the songs in the actual show so far,  so if there IS a music-themed spinoff with similar music,  I would probably like those songs too.

            But if they did a music based spinoff... does that mean they'd start "protecting their IP" by going after guys like Mandopony and Living Tombstone (Sorry those are the only two music artists I know the name of... )

            @JM Qwilleran: Yes,  even polka.  I honestly don't understand why it gets so much bad press,  outside of it having an "uncool" reputation.
<p></p>Honestly,  the only way one could really make a song unappealing to me would be to add annoying laughter to it,  and that isn't necessarily music in itself,  or if I absolutely hated the lyrics.

            @Pykrete: Underground,  right?  I was a little too young to catch any of the Sonic cartoons wave.
<p></p>Anyway,  I would be (and am) highly suspicious of a "band"-themed spinoff.  As someone said when the topic was brought up,  Disney's run the "genre" into the ground,  and I can't see the same 'be true to yourself' regurgitated Aesops being any more tolerable just because it's a pony version of the standard heroine saying them.

            @ed:  Not really,  but they probably want something big to launch it with,  and a movie is a good way to do that.

            A possibility of a band thing is likely But i just think they got the trademark just so that they won't get sued by <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatyPerry" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatyPerry">Katy Perry</a>'s lawyers.

            I admit,  a "Music Ponies" show/franchise would be <em>very</em> easy to screw up,  particularly the actual music,  and I'm being optimistic. Still,  its an idea,  and music was the first thing to come to mind with regards to "experiencing" My Little Pony in new ways.
<p></p>Also,  I apparently missed a couple of pages and Fighting is Magic getting C&amp;D'd while typing all that. It was only a matter of time really,  especially after being up for a poll to be at EVO. At least some awesome music came out of <em>that</em> project.

I'd much rather have two pony shows on at once,  and if the new one isn't that good the old one is still there.

            What if it has something to do with being like a "next generation" story?  Something set in the time period of the children of the current main cast (not all of them necessarily have to have children,  of course,  just maybe some of them),  or when the CMC are grown-ups.

            I would love to see them age up the CMC into teenagers and have them come up against typical teenage drama.
<p></p>Going to Highschool <br>Dating boys (OMG CANON SHIPS) <br>etc
<p></p>Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon could retain their role as bullies... or maybe join the CMC after running into bigger bullies in HS.

            What if they made a spinoff based off of some of the toyline-only ponies who haven't appeared on the show yet?
<p></p>Going with the older CMC idea or the future kids idea,  maybe some of those toyline-only ponies could be part of that.
<p></p>(I have no idea what's going to happen,  of course,  I'm just throwing out ideas)
