            Err,  no. That'd sort of go against the grain of the show (giving characters that little girls can identify with,  generally centering the show around female leads as opposed to every other cartoon).
<p></p>Not to mention tons of bitching about "they've pretty much put OCs in the show!"

            Oh sorry for ditching so qickly last night Doctor,  I've been running around so much with a chance to enter a proper Druid Sleep,  that I tend to have to get to regular sleep quick when I feel it coming or risk slipping into the Sleep.
<p></p>Anyway,  turns out the TARDIS has already figured out the issues and quantual locked itself for the time being,  and somehow managed to do so in a way that allows it to feed off this 'verse the same way she does from yours,  so that's why you didn't stall out this time. still how'd you end up crashing though to this dimension anyway? I would have thought I'd have detected it.

            I say it's probable to some minor character to be shipped together because Hasbro don't want homosexuality cause controversy in countries like Poland.
<p></p>And I bet they would choose Spitfire for that (who is dubed as male in Poland)

            I <em>did</em> find a non-pornograhic Flutterspike fic once that was fairly interesting (even if the beggining was a little <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot">excusish</a>,  but that was a while ago and now I can't find it. Basically,  Spike confessed his love to Rarity who rejected him and then Fluttershy comforted him and then,  afer Spike expressed his lack of hope that <em>anypony</em> would be interested in him,  confesses that she's had a crush on him for a while. What I really liked is that Spike <em>didn't</em> just fall for her,  but was touched and decided that he was going to try dating her to give it a hance as he knew what being rejected by your crush was like. They have a few dates hich are actually pretty sweet but even the description said that Fluttershy had a dark secret which was eventually revealed to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that she was keeping her psycho twin brother Butterscotch locked in her basement so that he couldn't kill again and wouldn't be taken away by the athorities.</span> Admittedly,  rather overdramatic,  but I was interested at least and at least it didn't give Fluttershy the Cupcakes treatment. That's as far as had been written when I found it.

            Funny thing,  both of those two stallions that Rarity charmed into pulling the carriage to the Gala would later be shown in relationships—Chance-a-lot/Caramel with Sassaflash during "Hearts and Hooves Day" and Lucky with Wild Fire in the past during one of the flashbacks in "A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1",  though it's possible that the Lucky who pulled the Gala carriage was a different pony,  since his coat was a bit different than usual in that appearance (both carriage-pullers also had the occasional other difference,  but only for single shots).

            Well,  the mane 6 don't really need the princess's help. It's always them who bail out the princess.
<p></p>Also,  they won't have directly stated homosexuality on the show for one simple reason: they want it to be as inoffensive as possible so they can sell. Addressing <em>any</em> form of controversy at all is going to go against that. A children's cartoon that primarily exists to sell toys can only be so progressive.

            Shipping is all sorts of weird to me,  mostly because they require very strange circumstances to make the smallest amount of logical sense.

            I think everyone misread me on this stallions episode thing. Or I misexpressed myself. (is that a word?) I just wanted a "this is the boys turn" episode. Just like we had episodes "Celestia is defeated,  the mane six free her and save Equestria",  this one would be "Celestia is defeated AND the mane six,  and six boys save them and Equestria"

I think that the idea was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that he'd eventually escape and try to kill Spike</span> so it's mainly there to add drama and conflict so that th fic isn't just fluff. As I said,  it actually got me interested in the outcome despite how ridiclous the added drama is. I'd certainly read more if I could ind it again.
