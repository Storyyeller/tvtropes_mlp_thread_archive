            Read chapter of Fallout Equestria. Got annoyed. Discussed. Bitched. Found out about a future scene in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Calamity guns down a raider foal</span>. Bitched some more. Got told off by a soldier. Now I generally feel like shit,  and Fallout Equestria continues to annoy me.

            Well it <em>is</em> kind of justified,  story-wise. Littlepip locks up on seeing him and can't do anything,  Velvet doesn't have a gun...Calamity basically followed his principles and did what he did because no one else was going to do anything.

            @Librarian: Yes,  but <em>why is it even there</em>? What's the point of the scene? Does it tie into an emotional thing,  or something? Is it a character point? If not,  it's just pointless fucking shock and realism or not it's a stupid,  cheap scene to have.

            I don't see why they would get starters similar to their pets. Rainbow picked Tank in the episode when she was saved by him. With the starters,  they would go by what they know. <br>Fire=cool. Fire/Fighting=cooler. I had a choice between Blaziken and Infernape,  and because I think Blaziken looks cooler,  I went with it. I also wanted to put RD and Scootaloo with similar starters.

            Then in that case,  you're right to be pissed against it. If it holds no point then it only exist for a cheap tug at the hearstrings. The situation was tragic,  yes,  and there was no other way it could have gone down. But this is a fictional situation. <em>there was no need for it to have occurred in the first place</em>.

            I dunno. I haven't gotten to that part in the story. I can only assume based on my fairly low opinion of the story.
<p></p>It's sad,  because at the rate I'm reading it's gonna take me a really long time to get to wherever it supposedly starts to get good.
<p></p>I think I'll take a shower. That might make me feel better. If not,  I'll be back to bitch as usual.

            Let me just point out,  that,  that scene is plausible within the boundaries of the setting. Both you guys might want to consider against reading further because there is a much MUCH worse scene later on. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Arbu,  Cannibal ponies,  Little pip flips the fuck out and decides that Incendiary ammunition is the appropriate response to the situation.</span>

            My picks:
<p></p><ul><li>Pinkie Pie - Totodile,  due to it being an alligator like Gummy
</li><li>Rarity - Snivy,  because its smug look just seems to DEMAND is being own by the fashionista,  and its evolution as the most stylish of all the starters
</li><li>Rainbow Dash - Squirtle,  due to the speed based irony and it being a water type,  making it help out with weather
</li><li>Applejack - Turtwig,  because of its evolution possible allows her grow apples on it as well as being a BIG help during applebucking season
</li><li>Fluttershy - Chikorita,  due to it being the cutest and most docile,  or Cyndaquil,  because its the closest to the woodland creatures she usually works with
</li><li>Twilight Sparkle - Charmander,  either to help her study dragons,  or Chimchar,  as a chance for her to study primates AND have a assistant that can do jobs Spike either cannot do or need help on
</li><li>Apple Bloom - Tepig,  because she lives on a farm and while just as rough and tumble and love the apple business like her sister but doesn't seem to connected with the gardening part of her heritage
</li><li>Scootaloo - Piplup,  due to here wanting to emulate Rainbow Dash
</li><li>Sweeite Belle - Mudkip or Oshawatt
</li><li>Big Mac - Treecko,  strong silent type
</li><li>Zecora - Bulbasaur,  due to the plant on its back having uses in herbal remedies
