            I think my bottom episodes are probably MMDW and A Friend In Deed.  I won't go into detail because that's never fun. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>Best episodes (outside of the finale) are probably Hurricane Fluttershy,  <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMMystery" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMMystery">MM Mystery</a>,  and maybe Sweet and Elite.

            Now one day it happened that a banquet was being held in the castle,  and she said to the cook,  "May I go up for a little while and take a look? I will stand outside the door."
<p></p>The cook answered,  "Yes,  go ahead. But you have to be back here in a half hour and carry out the ashes."
<p></p>Then she took her oil lamp and went into her cubbyhole. Taking off her cloak of hair,  she washed the dirt from her hooves and face so that her full beauty again came to light. Then she opened the nut and took out her dress that glistened like the sun. And after she had done all this she went upstairs to the banquet. Everypony stepped out of her way,  for nopony knew her,  and everypony thought that she was a princess.
<p></p>The prince approached her,  reached his hoof out to her,  and danced with her,  and thought in his heart,  "My eyes have never before seen such beauty."
<p></p>When the dance had ended,  she curtsied,  and while the king was looking around,  she disappeared,  and nopony knew where she had gone. The guards who stood watch in front of the castle were called and questioned,  but nopony had seen her.
<p></p>Now she had run back to her cubbyhole,  quickly taken off her dress,  dirtied her hooves and face,  put on the cloak of hair,  and was once again All-Kinds-of-Hair.

            After she had returned to the kitchen and was about to set to work and sweep up the ashes,  the cook said,  "That's enough until tomorrow. Make the prince's soup for me,  so I can have a look upstairs,  but don't let a hair fall into it,  or in the future there will nothing more for you to eat."
<p></p>Then the cook went away,  and All-Kinds-of-Hair made soup for the prince. She made bread soup,  and as good as she knew how. When it was done,  she got her golden ring from the cubbyhole and placed it in the bowl that the soup was in.
<p></p>When the dance was over,  the prince had his soup brought to him. He ate it,  and it tasted so good to him,  that he thought he had never eaten a better soup. But when he reached the bottom of the bowl,  he saw a golden ring lying there,  and he could not imagine how it had gotten there.
