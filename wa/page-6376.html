            No. They're not the hero-type.
<p></p>Well,  <em>maybe</em> AJ. But then you wouldn't get a lesson about big-headedness,  because she's not the braggart type.

            I think it could have worked on any Pony in the group... but the situation would have to change.  Being a Hero would not inflate Rarity's ego... you'd have to make it something else that would set her up for a fall...

            If you don't like it,  then just ignore the thread. Obviously the majority have no problem with it,  but yes by all means lets once again let one single persons pet peeve force everyone else to conform to what suits them..isn't that the exact mindset that has the forums in danger of getting cut over the stupid Google BS?
<p></p>If you have something about Ponies you want to discuss,  then do so,  no one's ever been told not to and we love doing so,  but if there's no ideas for pony discussions who cares if we talk about something else,  and the fact that this thread has the by far largest post count in the media forums pretty much shows how close knit we are that we enjoy talking to each other this much.

            It does speak to the show's character that if you switched them in Mysterious Mare do Well it'd be a completely different story.  I think if you switched Rarity in it'd have to be something like Sweet and Elite.
<p></p>I think Rarity would let the fame and adoration get to her head at first,  but she is sensitive to others around her.
