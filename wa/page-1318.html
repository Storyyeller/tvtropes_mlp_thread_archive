            Am I the only one who thinks that RD's and AJ's elements should be reversed?
<p></p>AJ's got the stubborn loyalty thing down. When she applies herself to something it's GOING to get done. Come hell or high water.
<p></p>And being brutally honest is one of the hallmarks of Rainbow Dash's character

            You know,  AJ and RD are quite interchangable when it comes to their Element.  <em>But</em>, 
<p></p>I think RD is definately Loyalty.  Watch Return of Harmony P.1. She isn't going anywhere 'till Ponyville's cleared.
<p></p>And she stuck by Pinkie and her other friends rather than go with Gilda.
<p></p>Although we haven't seen it too much,  I think RD would the first to jump in to defend a friend against a jerk.  <em>Don't talk to my friend like that you little punk!</em>,  and so on.
<p></p>AJ believes in fair play.  'Fall Weather Friends' showed that.  And that is an aspect of honesty.
<p></p>Edit: There's a lot of overlap with the Elements.  An arguement could be made for Rarity being the Element Of Kindness,  for example.

            Rarity <em>is</em> a really good pony. And I <em>do</em> really like her. It's just that I didn't realise how good she is until after the others,  so she has catching up to do. Plus,  I think that she'd pull a Look Before You Sleep on me and while I am more concerned about um...cleanliness than Applejack,  being spoken to like that would give me unpleasant flashbacks.

<p></p>@ Ginger,  I thought the same thing,  and then I remember <em>fall weather</em> friends and flagrant cheating is hardly the signs of an honest or honorable person. RD may be extremely honest and basically dosen't know when to stop running her mouth that is obviously more of a symptom of her stupidity than any virtue as an honest person.

            Well,  here's another way to consider her 'cheating'. Applejack,  the element of honesty (which I presume extends from simply telling the truth to avoiding things like,  say,  cheating) ended up cheating as well. At the end of the day,  their competition was fairly amorphous - they were competing over the nebulous issue of who was 'better'. So in a way the cheating became their competition - they were just trying to one-up each other.
<p></p>It doesn't necessarily make it <em>right</em>,  and they suffered for it by tying for dead last,  but as far as their personal competition went it was pretty much fair game. And for the record,  I will say again that their iron pony competition was much more suited towards AJ if RD hadn't been aloowed to use her wings.

The first time,  AJ flat out loses,  the second,  AJ's basically strong armed into cheating. True she could've been the better pony and ignored her,  but RD was being pretty fucking ruthless.
<p></p>You have a point about the competition,  although they DID both seem pretty even before the cheating started. Maybe all the events RD had a shot at were placed near the beginning for some reason

            Yeah,  Rainbow has a <em>real</em> problem with dealing with losing. Heck,  in her Cutie Mark story,  she says that her epiphany was along the lines of "Man,  I love racing,  I love speed,  but do you know what I love even more? <em>WINNING.</em>"

            Just wondering,  I have NO idea how bird's muscles work so forgive me if this is obvious:
<p></p>When Pegasi wings are curled up,  are the pegasi consciously holding them in that position? Or do they automatically return to being like that when they relax their muscles?

            It's just part of her character flaw,  really. She's brash,  and sort of slef-centred. The others do have similar bad qualities - Pinkie is insensitive,  Rarity can be selfish,  Twi and AJ are both extremely proud and Fluttershy is perhaps even more anti-social than Twilight. All of these can be elements of a bad person,  but they don't make the girls bad people,  because they all have a lot of positive qualities that balance the mout. Some of the just... aren't as obvious as others.

            I imagine it is conscious,  but only in the same respect as how you hold your head up. If you relaxed your neck your head would just fall and bob around,  and if they relaxed their wings they would just slump straight down.
