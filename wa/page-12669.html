            I thought of a forum game or character creation idea,  similar to the way that multiple people created the characters who were male foils for the Mane Six.  What about the children of the Mane Six?  I suppose there are two different ways I thought of,  one would be to use all the potential pairings within the group and make magically-born children for them.  I saw a fanart that showed the 15 different potential results of that.  Or each one could have their own kids that aren't necessarily with each other (or if they're paired together,  it involved stallion sperm donors).  My first idea would be that at least one of Pinkie's kids should be a quiet and serious type.  Because not only do I like opposites in general,  but having Pinkie deal with her child being her opposite would be the most interesting and probably the most frustrating for the characters involved.  This is because of all the Mane Cast,  it seems like Pinkie would have the most trouble understanding someone who was her opposite,  like shown with her problems with Cranky.
<p></p>However,  I'm not sure if this kind of thing is appropriate for this thread or if it should go somewhere else.

            Yeah,  it looks like they're phasing it out.  Which is just as well; even if they can come up with morals to tag on it means they can use that time on other stuff.

            hey,  it's time for part two of that fanfic report!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Hey all,  here's the next part of todays fanfic report! These stories are a lot heavier then the first set. Infact,  lets start with the heaviest one first and move on down the list of heaviness.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal">Friendship is Optimal<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Hasbro partners with a third company to make an MLP MMO. The game is run by a fully aware Princess Celestia AI whose prime directive is to satisfy everyone's values through ponies and friendship. Of course,  it doesn't stay just a game very long. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">Brain Uploading</a>,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels">much philosophical and metaphysical pondering</a>,  and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity">technological singularity</a> ensues.
<p></p>This is one of those stories that at the end,  it just leaves you wondering.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/1438/the-luna-project">The Luna Project<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. A midnight blue alicorn foal awakens for the first time in some kind of abandoned scientific facility and must learn who and what she is and what happened to whatever beings built this place.
<p></p>It's a humans created equestria fic! I know that sounds like it could turn out bad,  but it was actually pretty good. Definitely worth a read.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/66766/into-the-black-a-mares-tale">Into the Black: A Mare's Tale<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> -in progress. A battle with a mad unicorn mage ends when Twilight(and part of the mad unicorn) are sucked into a rift and flung across the universe. Twilight now finds herself in the middle of a war between humanity and a number of other alien races against the Dratali,  a race of aliens that believe all life in the universe should be extinguished,  including themselves. The war was not going particularly well,  as the Dratali were the only known race capable of utilizing magic. Could Twilight,  as an extremely accomplished mage,  turn the tide of the war? And how is she ever going to get back home?
<p></p>This fic starts out extremely similarly to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/13906/halo--on-the-wings-of-angels">On The Wings of Angels<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  and at it's most basic the two have roughly the same plot(or seem to so far,  at any rate),  but Into the Black distinguishes itself with an interesting original verse.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/31793/a-delicate-balance">A Delicate Balance<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> -in progress. Twilight Discovers that her feeling for one of her friends are different. She's also going to discover that not everything in life can be solved with logical and rational thought,  research,  and planning. Sometimes you just have to jump in,  go with the flow,  and see what happens...
<p></p>I told you I'd read this eventually JT! Seriously though,  I wasn't too big a fan of it,  but that's because I'm not too big a fan of romance in general. I think you did a good job keeping all the characters mostly in character though. Pinkie seems just a bit off,  but I can't put my finger on what it is.
<p></p>And that's all the fanfics for today! I hope somebody got some more reading material from all this! Until next time!
<p></p>Your faithful fanfic reader <br>-Blissey1</div>

            Every episode has still had a rather explicit moral spelled out at the end of the episode,  but they're being done more naturally. Too Many Pinkie Pies is really the only time a letter was needed,  because it was the only time a non-CMC character learned a lesson that warranted reporting.

            The CMC did learn a lesson,  they just didn't write a letter.
<p></p>That still fits the basic formula.

            I thought of a more general question about the Mane Cast's potential foals and opposites: How would each of them react to having a child who was her opposite,  personality-wise?  I personally guess that it might be the hardest or the most confusing for Pinkie and Twilight,  especially since Pinkie has a hard time grasping even the concept of needing solitude,  much less living with someone who does.  Twilight might be able to understand someone who wasn't interested in studying,  but she might also be the type of parent who is a bit of an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama">Education Mama</a> as well.  She seems pretty tolerant of Spike's differences from her,  though,  and same with her relations with Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie.
<p></p>Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash are probably the two who have the most experience with those who are different from them,  because of their interactions with each other,  but that's different from it being their children,  too.  Fluttershy might end up being bossed around and overly permissive with a loud,  demanding foal,  unless she pulled out The Stare on him/her.
<p></p>Rarity and Applejack both have siblings who have some opposite traits,  like Apple Bloom putting social status (or fear of bullying) over telling the truth,  or how Sweetie Belle often wants to do things like camping that Rarity doesn't like to do.
