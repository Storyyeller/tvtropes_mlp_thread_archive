            I'll be looking for a little crummy community college here in Vegas so I can get the preliminaries out of the way. Mean while I hope to get a side job so I can start saving up for the next few years. Once I have enough I'll probably move out to California and find a university. At least in Cali there's some programs for the vi,  Nevada has a patheticly small budget for the disabled.

            I'm going to second <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaFour" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaFour">Meta Four</a> on this. College does have it's advantages,  but having been through both college and graduate school,  it's actually kinda refreshing to have a job where I can go home and be <em>done</em> rather than have to worry about writing a paper or getting some assignment in on time.  Also,  you get paid for the job,  whereas college drains your money,  which sucks.  And this is coming from a guy who didn't get screwed <em>too</em> badly on student loans.
<p></p>Granted,  I'm only making minimum wage now,  but it's better than nothing.

            Y'know,  on Friday I was working in the city center and I had to seriously go to the toilet.  I eventually ended up at my uni,  whereby I discovered that there was not a single usable toilet to be found anywhere on campus.  The one in the library had been ripped up for renovation work,  the one in the SU was blocked by a hoard of drunken fools going to a concert and all the others where locked.  I thought,  how typical of this place.  I spat on it's sign and left.  After Thursday I never want to see it again.

<p></p>I think it depends a lot on what kind of job you have and how demanding your courses are. It still seems weird to me though that noone else shared my experience.

            Yeah,  I can definitely agree with college vs. job free time. In my last quarter of college I had literally <em>no</em> free time,  because even when I didn't have classes,  I was working on my portfolio. And the portfolio only covered <em>one</em> class out of five,  so I had portfolio projects <em>plus</em> four classes worth of homework to handle. Plus,  a job <em>pays</em> you,  instead of vice versa.
<p></p>Also,  I just heard my boss say "J'mapple Rainbow Dash,  et je suis un [[Nazi]]." Apparantly she was quoting a report ticket from somewhere,  but considering she's German and has a Rainbow Dash figure on her desk...

            @Story: What year are you in college?  Freshman and sophomore year weren't bad,  but in junior and senior year when I had to start doing larger projects (plus working part time to not be broke) I had a lot less free time than I do now.

<p></p>I was thinking about this several months ago for whatever reason,  and concluded that ponies would swim faster with butterfly than any of the easier strokes,  because it would use the tail and keep the main power of the stroke in the body and upper legs instead of the hooves.
<p></p>Which is amusing,  because for us butterfly is considered one of the slower strokes despite its difficulty.

            I'm just starting my sophomore year. In addition to being the editor in charge of keeping up with our social media,  I'm also taking Basic Reporting,  Media History,  Publication Design and Production,  Government,  and some art class. Basic Reporting and the editor position make me think that they're going to be the hardest things because of deadlines alone.
