            I'm with Bad here Ginger,  Rainbow NEVER expected any of the pets to die or even hurt themselves for her,  she honestly didn't think there'd be any real danger in the place.
<p></p>Yes thinking that was incredibly short sighted and wrong,  but it's better then willingly bringing them somewhere she know they could get hurt or killed. Again was still a bad idea,  but due to incompetence,  not malice.

            I think it is very easy to make a perfect character. Flawed characters are much more interesting and it includes times were they will be wrong.

            @Bad She herself didn't sound all that confident when she was explaining the rules of the race to them,  especially after seeing the (terrified) looks on their faces. It was like for a split second she realized that expecting them to do this was completely insane,  but then extinguished the feeling because it would mean admitting that she was wrong (and that would make her look bad.)
<p></p>I don't think Dash is a bad person,  if you notice,  I defend her a lot of the time and I don't understand all the hatred for her,  but at the same time,  I like it being recognized that she was 100% in the wrong in the episodes where she's meant to be

            I'm not arguing everyone's decisions don't count,  because they all count,  I'm just explaining why for her they make her unlikable to me. The others have made decisions I can understand,  for her there is simply a level of stupid/confidence/insensitivity I cannot comprehend and therefore I cannot connect with her.

            @ Bad,  I agree the parasprite one was Pinkie's fault and no real excuse,  but it's not 100% on her either,  just mostly. The Singing,  ok wasn't exactly smart for her to do it,  but there was no way she could know it would have THAT bad an effect,  close but not really over the line for me.
<p></p>The AJ one,  I'd have to disagree,  she honestly thought she could handle it,  and by the time it started negatively impacting other ponies she was to tired and worn out to really realize this,  she'd been working her tail off,  probably getting little sleep and little food,  for at least two weeks. She was in no mental state to make rational decisions,  the only thing keeping her even moving was her pride and stubbornness.

            Yes RD makes alot of bad decisions,  but what matters to me is that she never intentionally does anything she knows will hurt another pony,  physically or emotionally. Yes she is thoughtless and careless at times,  and honestly of the 6 the one I'd probly least want to hang out with or be around,  but despite that she does have a good heart,  it's just her brain that needs a swift kick in the plot every now and then.

            @ Ginger: Really? I don't hear that. To me it sounds like she's reassuring them.
<p></p>I don't think anyone in this show is ever 100% wrong. Her intentions in Mare Do Well for example were at least at the beginning for a good cause.
<p></p>@ Mousa: Understood.
<p></p>@ Seraph: Well it's never 100% their fault but there should always be accountability. I agree that AJ didn't know her limits,  but she should have had the sense to ask for help after she was overstepping them even if she wasn't at her best. Arguably she'd be at her worst at the end of the episode,  but Twilight still managed to get through to her.

<p></p>I totally agree with you Ginger.
<p></p>Just imagine a Rainbow Dash without any flaws. Would she be as interesting?... t would be boring IMO
