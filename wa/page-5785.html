            Like I said,  I don't think we've gotten as far as having an actual skill list.  I'm sure there will be earth pony and pegasus specific skills,  but that hasn't been laid out yet.

            Hm... I imagine there will be <em>some</em>,  but probably not as extensive as armour and weapons? Probably things like acessories and charms,  things that might give little 'magical' stat bonuses. Though hey,  they've got armour in-universe,  I don't see any real reason <em>not</em> to use it if it comes down to that.

            @Ginger: Some kind of a penatly,  or something? Heavy armour gives a Constitution bonus,  but gives a hit to Agility. That probably makes a bit of sense. Makes it good for a tank,  but not for,  say,  a rogue. I recall in Neverwinter Magic classes couldn't wear heavy armours because it gave their spells a chance of failing - they couldn't move to make the symbols properly.
<p></p>Night,  Crow.
<p></p>I'm probably gonna hit the sack soon myself. Before I do,  though,  <a class="urllink" href="http://i163.photobucket.com/albums/t289/kegisak/WhatMeetsTheEye_Character_Shading.png?t=1333448192">the latest version of the commission I've been working on<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  for the curious! Still not completely done,  I need to shade the environment tomorrow,  and add in some details. Still,  what do you think of the shading on the characters,  at least?
<p></p>Also,  have another one of <a class="urllink" href="http://i163.photobucket.com/albums/t289/kegisak/WhatMeetsTheEye_Shadow_Blend.png?t=1333448192">these<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  just because I love the effect.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">From what I recall you start with everything at 10,  and you have maybe 5 points to put in? Plus you can take points out of other skills to use,  but 10 is dead average,  so anything less than 10 and you take penalties for checks on that skill.

            @Kegi: Yeah,  for equipment I'd go with accessories and magical items. Items will probably be kept in saddlebags,  so there will likely be a weight limit. The most we see any pony carry is 2 bags at a time. Maybe Earths can carry slightly more.
<p></p>We could get minions to pull a cart,  maybe.

            How do you inrease your attributes outside of the initial creation process? Or can't you?
<p></p>Or can you only temporarily increase them using skills?
<p></p>Like,  are some of the skills you learn only passive stat boosts? Or all they all active skills you can use?

            I think you get a stat point every couple of levels or so? The max for a stat is 20,  I believe. Plus there are temporary buff skills,  and some equipment gives stat bonuses.
<p></p>But I'm going off <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverWinterNights2" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverWinterNights2">Never Winter Nights 2</a>,  which is a fairly old game. And even then I don't know it inside and out; I pretty much just made a character and ran around a bit to get a feel for gamplay. I really couldn't tell you the bulk of the system.
<p></p>Anyhow,  I'm off to bed. Night,  all. Or morning,  but whatever.

            Yawn,  seems so. I like <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGs">RP Gs</a> but I never was interested in having to tinker with stat building,  I just want to have my character and their abilities and to have a good run around in a new world as the character. I always get the feeling too many are obsessed with messing with numbers rather than actual roleplaying.

            Ooh,  Pony RPG! Interested! I've actually been thinking of a system myself. Though it's more based on Exalted than D&D. Still,  a D&D system would also be fun. Just remember,  it's not truly a pony game without a sanity mechanic.

            I had a few rough ideas for a Pony RPG system. However,  it was supposed to be an in-universe game (it was meant to be played by ponies),  so it's not actually set in Equestria,  and functions under a rather different magic system.
