            Re: Season 1 vs. Season 2: Season 2 definitely took more risks,  but season 1 was more consistent.  The best season 2 episodes were better than the best season 1 episodes,  but the same goes for the worst episodes,  I think season 1 had more consistent quality than season 2 did.  Overall,  it's hard to say.  Although I must say I think season 1 did better with the ensemble episodes.  Season 2 had too many episodes focusing on just one or two ponies.  Which isn't bad by any means,  but I like seeing their group dynamics,  and season 2 didn't have much of that.

Already? That was sooner than I thought. <br> <br>I'd go with AJ's farmhouse. It just seems like it would be the most cozy and pleasant. Rainbow's is nice,  but is a bit too show-offy for me. <br> <br>I sort of agree with J Teeth. In terms of quality,  Season 2 is better and has my favorite episodes,  but some of them are just forgettable to me. Although I disagree about the ensemble issue; I prefer the smaller groupings. <br> <br>@ Luna's line. I thought it was just a sort of "hey,  it might be dangerous,  you should go where it's safe" thing. She probably specifically mentioned Twilight because she knows her.

            But the prince did not give in,  and the most skilled mares in his kingdom had to weave the three dresses,  one as golden as the sun,  one as silver as the moon,  and one that glistened like the stars. And his councilors were sent out to talk to everypony in his entire kingdom and gather hair from each ones. From these a cloak of a thousand kinds of pony hair was made.
<p></p>Finally,  when everything was finished,  the prince had the cloak brought to him. Spreading it out,  he said,  "Tomorrow is our wedding day."

            When the prince's daughter saw that there was no more hope to change her father's mind,  she made the decision to run away. During the night,  while everypony was asleep,  she got up and took three things from among her valuables: a golden ring,  a little golden spinning wheel,  and a little golden reel. She put the three dresses from the sun,  moon,  and stars into a nutshell,  put on the cloak of all kinds of pony hair,  and dirtied her hooves and face with dirt. Then she set forth. She walked the entire night until she came to a great forest. Being tired,  she sat down in a hollow tree and fell asleep.

            Hmmmm...? This sounds vaguely familiar. In the faded memories of yesteryear I recall a book of fairy tales that had something like this story. At least I recall the bit about hiding the stuff inside a nut.

It's not really that I forgot them,  it's just that I can't really remember anything about them. Off the top of my head,  I don't remember much about Secret of My Excess,  May the Best Pet Win,  and Hurricane Fluttershy.
