            I have a theory: A Hydra is so scary not because of it's size or its menace (It has both in spades) But because it actively eats ponies and is immune to Fluttershy. For this reason the hydra is more feared by pony society than even dragons causing the Mane Cast to drop bricks when it appeared.

            How can anyne think that It's About Time favoured Pinkie. She had no clue what she was doing! In season 1,  she'd have inexplicably known how to work telescopes and would have known why Twilight was in Canterlot!

            I don't see the need for members of a species to act radically different from another member of a species,  especially if their is no reason for them to. If you want to blame that on anything,  then blame it on Griffon or Donkey culture not being established in the show (and I doubt it will be unless they travel to their territory).
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I guess it is because she never suffered negative consequences for it? I don't really remember.
<p></p>Also I do generally feel that Pinkie's personality was a bit more down to earth in early season one.

            The one thing I'll sorta kinda agree with moe on is that Griffons are the only civilized creatures introduced that <em>aren't</em> hooved. Ponies,  pegasi,  unicorns,  buffalo,  donkeys,  goats,  even the minotaur,  they're all hooved. Griffons only relation to ponies is that they enjoyed eating horses,  if my mythology knowledge is correct. For that reason,  I could see someone wanting Griffons to be kinda different. Not completely alien,  but different.

<p></p><span class="blue">Of course it doesn't.  I was simply correcting you when you stated that such a thing wasn't done,  as if it were some kind of rule.  Keeping differing races completely alien is much,  <em>much</em> rarer.  Personally I prefer it that other races are a bit alien to each other as well,  but in a show of this sort just having them look different adds enough variety to interest me.  We already have 3 distinct species of ponies in our main race,  which I find interesting already.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">@Moe Dantes: The truth is that you have a <em>very specific</em> idea of how the show should be done that has a 0% chance of actually being made.  That's fine,  there's changes I would like made to the show as well that I know are never going to happen.  The thing that tends to annoy people around here is that you usually speak as though your vision is objectively right and that the show makers are just too dumb to realize they need to change things,  when in actuality they simply have a different vision and have no interest in making those kinds of changes.</span>

            Sorry Kuroi.  With how fast this thread moves,  I often can't keep up with every post made.
<p></p>Do you mean <em>this</em> post?
<div class="quoteblock">I don't see how the dragons are just like you,  but with scales. In the very least they feel alien compared to Spike,  as the entire episode they acted like a giant bunch of mean spirited douche bags,  which clearly made Spike feel alienated. Yes,  ponies can be jerks too,  but for them it's more out of the ordinary,  whereas with dragons it seems to be the general attitude.</div>
<p></p>That's the thing though... they felt alien to Spike the way teenagers <em>normally</em> feel alien to little kids.  It's entirely a standard-issue "naive youngster falling in with a rowdy older crowd" scenario,  similar stories of which have been done on Doug,  Pepper Ann,  Jem and the Holograms etc.
<p></p>It's again the same as the Griffons.  The story could have been Sweetie Belle hanging out with older unicorns and it would've been roughly the same story (better,  possibly,  because the aesop wouldn't have been quite as forced and headdesk-inducing).

<p></p>We've seen two,  the older speaks with a French accent,  the younger speaks in a more <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">Totally Radical</a> way. Perhaps this hints in a change in the Griffon language recently,  perhaps different tribes have different accents as well as different vocations,  Gilda's being flying Gustave's being cooking.

            Diamond dogs are fascinating if a bit cliched. They are effectively goblins/kobolds in all intents and purposes. Greedy,  distinct lack of intelligence,  and tendency to hang out in moderate sized groups of mooks with a couple leaders holding it all together (If a bit incompetently).

            Moe: I guess the story does fit into that archetype to an extent,  but I got a bit of a different impression.  It seemed to me like the dragons expected Spike to be tough not because they're teenagers,  but because it dragons were expected to be raised that way.  There was also clearly at least one pair of adult dragons fighting each other during the flight over Ponyville.  Which leads me to believe the culture is quite a bit more spartan than the ponies',  which made it a big shock for Spike.

            @Badwolf - Specifics matter here.  A cat scratching a post is not the same as a human scratching an itch,  and no-one would say people and cats are similar because they scratch.  In Rarity's case,  she has a reason for wanting diamonds (she uses them in her dresses).  With the Dogs on the other hand,  it seems to be a species-wide cultural thing.
<p></p>And my problem with the dragons is nothing like my problem with the cows and griffons.  The dragons suck because they contradicted previously established canon and took what could have been an interesting story and made it just stupid instead.  Not because they're too much like ponies‚ÄîI'll admit they aren't,  but that's not the issue.

<p></p>Perhaps back in the nineties that statement would have been true but nowadays? No.
<p></p>@Lurker Yeah Although they would fit in perfectly in Nintendo verse unfortunately there are precedents to keep,  Ponies are neither Nintendo nor video game related.
