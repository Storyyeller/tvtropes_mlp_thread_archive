            I <em>sort</em> of get the thinking that Twilight restoring her friends was done too quickly,  but at the same time,  it makes sense. It was just a condensed version of how she herself was returned to normal. I kind of wish that they had given a short flashback clip-show for each character,  like was done with Applejack,  but I guess they really didn't have enough time.
<p></p>And I guess I can accept Discord screwing up at the end. It may have gone differently if Applejack and Twilight weren't the only ones to speak up in that scene. (Though you'd think that he'd have recognized what was going on when he saw Pinkie's antic before she got in formation.

            Something else just dawned on me... way back,  before Discord was revealed,  I was kinda hoping he was a unicorn so he could have a magic-horn-lightsaber duel with Twilight Sparkle. That didn't happen,  but we got a massive <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a> shout out anyways,  so I was close!

            Okay,  maybe I need to watch the episode again,  but did Discord's antics affect anything outside Ponyville?
<p></p>Cause if not,  what on Earth is Celestia's excuse for not directly helping? She's clearly worried about Discord,  and even without harnessing the Elements of Harmony,  she's got some magic power,  so where was she? Was she really so busy with something else that she couldn't do any beyond the Equestrian equivalent of sending e-mail back? This goes beyond trolling into outright laziness.

It would've been a pointless battle,  and if she ever got seriously harmed,  then Equestria wouldn't have its Princess should he be defeated. She had faith in the mane cast,  and it's possible that she planned out the whole thing with the letters for just such an occasion

            Just finished watching the episode. Pretty good ending. I think Discord's overconfidence was actually a pretty good way for him to be beaten. Pride comes before a fall and all that.

            He was just <em>starting</em> with Ponyville. He was also screwing with the roads directly leading to it,  and was messing with the movement of the sun and moon,  and all the stuff he did to the labyrinth garden. I'm guessing that he was indeed effecting stuff outside of Ponyville,  it's just that he was using that place as,  basically,  his base,  the epicenter of what he was doing.
<p></p>Anyway,  the fact that he was messing with he movement of the sun and moon is a pretty clear sign to me that Celestia and Luna were pretty much unable to do much of anything to help.
