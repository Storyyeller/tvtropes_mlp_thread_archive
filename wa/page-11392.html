            @Trutlebutter: I was under the impression that before the "incident" it was much closer to the show and the grimdark came later.
<p></p>@Blissey: So why did Dash call her a traitor? Why did none of them go to her aid? Why were they mostly not in contact with each other?
<p></p>I just don't see any good explinations for why that happened.

            Bliss: I think it's that idealism that would have prevented her from proceeding,  actually.  She'd say that there must be a better way: one that would please everyone.  Or if Dash's words hit her hard enough,  she would withdraw and hide in a corner (which she has a tendency to do when things go sour).  The way she proceeded was almost more of a mad scientist's approach (keep testing,  no matter how many lives it costs!),  IMO.

<p></p>Same here. And I don't think Celestia's joke was OOC. It seems like the kind of joke friends would make to each other. And it's not like Celestia went out of her way to do it. She just picked one place out of three that was suitable.

            Fluttershy saw that her healing megaspell turned out badly but she was still trying to develop her immunity/shielding megaspell which was never finished and would have been a big help.
<p></p>As for why Dash called her a traitor,  it's because she <em>was</em> one! Helping the enemies of your country,  no matter how pure your intentions,  makes you a traitor. The others weren't there because they were in other cities running their ministries.

<p></p>if I recall,  Flutters only ever made healing and shielding megaspells. nothing that would cause lives to be lost. Other ponies were responsible for the weaponized forms.
<p></p>@Mio: Dash called her a traitor for the same reason; being away from her friends,  her loyalty had shifted more towards equestria than them. As for why they weren't there,  they were busy with their own things. Simple as that. I'll admit,  I don't have much experience with running a nation,  but I imagine it doesn't leave much time for casual visits.
<p></p>that's the explanation in the story,  and I find it acceptable. If that's not enough for you,  well,  then it's just not enough for you.

            My biggest gripe with FOE is that it sort of failed to introduce or even name several of the new Elements of Harmony.  They just sort of magically appeared and cast the megaspell to restore Equestria and everyone lived happily ever after.
<p></p>Has anyone written sidestories to compensate for this?

            Yes but it still felt cheap that the elements werent even named,  even in the Epilogue.
<p></p>I dont care if its a character thats in one scene in the epilogue... I want to know who they are.

<p></p>Sereg: I don't recall her working on an immunity spell (which brings other sorts of issues like "how do you now stop the immune soldiers from running around burning each others' crops?",  but I'll assume Fluttershy wasn't thinking that far ahead),  but taking that as fact: okay,  so she's working on an immunity spell.  So in the meantime,  she releases the version that she knows will cause more pain and suffering?  Nope,  still can't believe it.

            Well there's also the fact that on the first use of a healing megaspell it also healed the zebra soldiers too,  causing the battle that had just ended to start all over again. She then gave the research notes for creating megaspells to zebras (who by this point had a LOGIC-SMOTHERING HATRED OF EQUESTRIA for a very stupid and outdated reason),  thinking that they would keep them as tools of healing instead of tools of destruction. So yeah,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouFailLogicForever" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouFailLogicForever">Logical Fallacies</a> was very heavily upon her mind.
<p></p>In my opinion a more reasonable portrayal of what the main six would do if involved in a war is in <em>Equestria: Total War</em>. Pinkie is unable to keep up her cheerful attitude when ponies under her command get killed,  Rarity's generosity is taken advantage of by the griffins that Equestria is at war with,  Rainbow Dash's loyalty to her troops causes a full-on battle instead of an ambush like the plan was due to not reading the entire plan and running in beforehand causing many more casualties than would have happened with the ambush,  and Fluttershy (despite being assigned to the <em>medics</em>) is unable to even conceive of hurting another pony and as such runs away and spends months in a cave pretending the war isn't happening.
