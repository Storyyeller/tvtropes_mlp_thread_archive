            I like the theory that Luna was out guarding Equestria "on the field" while Celestia was taking care of the castle. And then they switched responsibilities. But since Celestia is (presumably) closer to Cadence,  she would be the one at the wedding while the other sister was out keeping everything safe.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> Huh. That's possible and makes sense. She just decided to go herself because her powers of control were stronger. Like,  she can actually mind-control someone while the mooks can pretty much only change shape.

It's unlikely that the changelings could impersonate the pricesses to one another because <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">Their current bodies are not their true forms,  and nopony knows what they really look like.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess"> To meet and be sure,  all they'd have to do is meet in the disguise of their true forms.
<p></p>Anyways,  I'm out for a bit. Gotta go to a job fair,  see what I can see. Later folks.

            I think they were attempting to establish justification when the Princesses changed watch. Because night was arriving,  Luna would be on watch,  which probably means Celestia went to bed,  therefore during the day Luna sleeps and Celestia does her thing,  heck I bet that's their system and they have 24/7 rule of the Kingdom because there is always a monarch around at all hours.

            Well,  Luna comes back from some sort of work (I assume- not necessarily just the guard duty) at the end,  so maybe they just don't feel like keeping guard at night is important? But I don't want to think that she was sleeping,  it would be kind of selfish of her. It's also possible she was taking over extra duties while Celestia was presiding over the wedding.

            Yup,  that sounds about right.
<p></p>And the step-up of security explains why Luna didn't wake up during the whole thing. Can you imagine how tiring doing security 12/7 would be?

Come on,  even gods need rest. Luna has presumably been guarding and keeping watch over the night <em>every</em> night since the threat was released. She was flying back in from raising the moon,  which is officially the signal for Celestia to go back inside and take her <em>own</em> rest.

            I think the changelings can mix and match body parts from different ponies to create a more unique look,  but they can't create a completely new form from scratch,  or it's at least a very rare skill if any of them can.

<p></p>For some reason I can imagine that. Except I really want to believe she was busy doing something instead of missing a wedding for such a dumb reason
<p></p>I guess selfish isn't the right word. I just find it strange that she wouldn't go to the wedding at all. She might not know her as much as Celestia,  but Cadence would also be her niece. It's kind of in bad spirit to miss a wedding of a close family member unless you have a good reason.
