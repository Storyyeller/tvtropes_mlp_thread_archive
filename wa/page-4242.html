            Why not have him appear as the Supreme Being from Time Bandits?  Ponified,  of course.  Or make him something that the ponies can't view directly as we don't really have "absolute" or "pure" order in the universe.

            @Mio As much as I enjoy Cybermen,  I don't think that would work. Order is supposed to be Discord's enemy,  so it works better as just one pony.
<p></p>@bad But since Equestria's flora and fauna can't exist without pony intervention,  I'd say Everfree is doing pretty well.
<p></p>@Mousa I don't know why,  but I automatically assume Order is male. I guess it's because Luna/Celestia is the good female pair,  so I think the "bad" pair should be the same gender.

            I see Order as looking like a plain pony,  but having massive power like Discord. That way it would shock the Mane 6,  since the whole reason I'm suggesting he came is because Twilight summoned him out of curiosity.
<p></p>Bah,  screw it,  I won't be able to keep Order how I had him in my head anyway. I'm going to go watch TV or something.

            @ Sky: Yeah the Everfree is doing well on it's own but the fact is the rest of Equestria is perfectly organised. Ponies regulate the weather,  ponies regulate the seasons,  ponies regulate flora and fauna,  ponies even regulate the day and night cycle. The Everfree doesn't play by those rules it's just chaos.

            Mio: Maybe you could fight him by forcing him to stay within a physical form for extended periods and isolating him.  The longer he stays in a single host,  the weaker he becomes because the fleshy body and this physical universe is so disorderly?  He spreads because that's the only way to maintain his strength.  Then again,  that raises the question of how you isolate an idea.

            @bad Maybe Order would say something along the lines of "ponies are doing a good job of keeping order" at first,  but upon seeing how lush Everfree is,  he could change his mind to think "nature could flourish without ponies." Of course,  he'd be wrong,  and Equestria would become a wasteland.

            @Bindlestick: Not really.  It's a bit of a shame,  since there will inevitably be a lot of parts you won't really enjoy,  but it doesn't stop you from legitimately liking something.

            @ Sky: I thought Order wanted to micromanage everything himself he wants to get rid of ponies so that he controlled all the previously mentioned things. So I'd think that on seeing the Everfree Forest working on it's own he'd try to assume direct control of its nature. Then the Everfree would fight back.
