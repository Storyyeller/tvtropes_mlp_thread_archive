            I never felt that way in the show,  actually. Well,  except during BBBBF and that horrible song at the end of Heart's Warming Eve. I actually muted them until they ended when I heard them the first time and I don't think I will ever try listening to them in their entirety.

            I liked EQG more than I expected to. I didn't like the character designs going into it,  but they grew on me,  though a few could have benefited greatly from some tweaking. Applejack wearing a miniskirt is probably the one that gets most under my skin.
<p></p>The plot was nothing spectacular. The conflicts were each resolved almost as soon as they were introduced,  and some of them never even should have been problems to begin with. Flash Sentry was completely pointless,  and his screen time was badly needed for other aspects of the movie,  like making Sunset a more competent villain or giving RD an actual part.
<p></p>That said,  most of the humanizations were pretty good,  and it was fun trying to identify all the background characters as they went by. Most of the humor was solid,  especially Twilight's attempts to understand the human world and Pinkie's casual fourth wall painting,  and there were plenty of fandom nods to try and catch.
<p></p>Overall,  worth a rental,  not a purchase.

            BBFF kind of grew on me. At first I really didn't like it and wanted to hear this song called This Day Aria everyone was talking about,  but after going back I found myself humming the tune. My favorites have to be Find A Pet,  Smile,  Babs Seed,  and What My Cutie Mark is Telling Me.
<p></p>And Ask DNA,  the Singing Sea,  Call Me,  and Green Bird have to be my favorite Bebop songs,  but all of it's awesome in general.

            @storyyeller - I found it to be excruciatingly cheesy and saccharine. Before anyone even say "How are you even watching the show?" or the ilk,  well,  let's just say we all have different opinion on what's cheesy and what's not and other standards and leave it at that.

            @dark - No,  don't touch it. Unless it's blatantly inaccurate or clogged up with natters,  it is strictly against the site's policy to <em>remove</em> an entry in a YMMV page,  like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a> page. Just leave them alone.
<p></p>But yeah,  90% the entries the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a> and the Awesome page is just <em>pathetic.</em>
