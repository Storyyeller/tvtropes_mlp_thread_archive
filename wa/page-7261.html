            @story Yep. The Tenth Doctor once claimed <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeSpam" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeSpam">that he hated pears.</a>
<p></p>I'm reading through the meta examples on the MLP Awesome page. A lot of them are,  well,  awesome.

            @ginger: Some series are better than others(Although the generally have a ways to go before they catch their stride; Naruto slowly shifts into a strong overarching plot and One Piece has good morals and can be genuinely heart warming,  not to mention the action is fantastic and ironically more down-to-earth),  but the vast majority of them fall into that same dumb tournament-style of arc repetition. It's one of those genres where you get a few standouts,  and the rest is junk.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_down.png" alt="[down]" title="[down]" height="16" width="16">Ah... yeah,  considering I've only watched the first series and you're reading the books,  I think our opinions are very naturally going to divide.

            @kegi I really started hating him in A Clash Of Kings,  because he pretty much came off as a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringInvincibleHero" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringInvincibleHero">Boring Invincible Hero</a> (the same way Daenerys feels like one in Swords) He just did EVERYTHING right and never seemed to mess up.
<p></p>I've been liking him MUCH better in book 3,  now that all of his success has either been destroyed or turned against him,  and his dad has taken the reins as the primary schemer of the family again. As I said before,  I prefer my protagonists when they're struggling and failing,  not when they're on top.
<p></p>It's an odd problem of mine. (shrug)

<p></p>Discord was admittedly <em>way</em> too powerful for his defeat to be anything but him being stupid,  which wa unfortunate and which is why I hope that he only comes back in flashbacks. He was still entertining though.
<p></p>But the most ridiculously powerful antogonist I have ever seen is Ajimu from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedakaBox" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a>. And yet,  we love her for it! She's just so ridiculous,  it wraps around to awesome. Plus,  she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> used <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">Defeat Means Friendship</a> on the protagonist,  rather than the other way around</span>! I seriously wonder how many fictional characters are more powerful than her. There can't be many short of true omnipotents.
