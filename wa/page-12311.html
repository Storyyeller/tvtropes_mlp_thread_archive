            I am very relieved and pleased by this episode.  I'm very glad it was more like "don't continue the cycle of bullying" as the lesson rather than "just ignore the bully and magically turn off your emotions and the bully will magically leave you alone!" which is what I felt like I was being told and I was a little afraid they would go with something along those lines (at least I knew that having them say "just ignore it" as a resolution would make me angry" but I read the trope page before watching the episode and I was glad that nothing like that was mentioned.  They pretty much did the opposite of that,  the CMC did try to ignore Babs but they showed through the song how hard it is to simply ignore a bully who keeps pestering you and picking on you no matter where you try to go.  I don't think that Babs was a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a> since she obviously learned her lesson and changed for the better,  even going as far to defend the CMC from DT and SS which showed her growth from the beginning where she was afraid of being bullied by them (which was why she started it in the first place).
<p></p>And I was correct in guessing that the story would involve a harvest festival parade of some sort,  since the episode was aired soon after Thanksgiving (which is a harvest festival that has the famous Macy's parade).  And was Pinkie's float edible?  It looked like she was eating the leaves on it!

<p></p>Upon reflection,  I think that <em>One Bad Apple</em> is my new favorite episode. Mostly for Babs' story. And all the little hints they put when animating her.

            I don't know if its been talked about (I've missed a few pages it seems),  but Babs VA is some chick named Bryanna Drummond. I guess she's related to Brian Drummond? He works on the show (<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndreaLibman" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndreaLibman">Andrea Libman</a> has mentioned him I think),  supposedly he voices Mr. Cake. Reason we don't have that listed is the only source for that if I recall is IMBD,  which is of course not reliable (its fooled us several times in regards to the MLP cast).
<p></p>Oh well,  hopefully the Cakes talk again in a future episode so we can settle it once and for all. So glad they're listing voice actors for specific episodes now in the credits.

            I wonder if even a slight part of Babs' motivation for choosing the bully the CMC by almost stalking them may be because she hates being ignored?  It didn't mention the exact nature of the bullying that happened to her in Manehatten,  but what if some of it involved her being given the silent treatment by others she wanted to be friends with?

            I think the main reason for the strong reactions to this episode is that by tackling a much more realistic and hot-button issue,  it's much more likely to affect people,  especially if they've experienced bullying in some capacity.  It's one of those subjects that everybody has really strong opinions about.  But honestly,  I don't think the reception has been all that bad so far.  Yes,  there are a few people who feel like this is a low point,  but <em>every</em> episode has a few people who think it's the worst of the series.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I'm guessing it was more direct than that.  She seemed <em>really</em> self conscious about her lack of a cutie mark,  so I'm guessing that a lot of the bullying back home had to do with that.  My headcanon about it is that she's the only blank flank left in her class,  which left her without any support,  and made it a real sensitive issue for her.  Then she shows up in Ponyville and the CMC <em>will not shut up about cutie marks</em>,  which makes Babs highly uncomfortable around them,  even if they are in the same boat as her (adding to it is the fact that she seems a bit older than them).

<p></p>Ugh,  at those people who cried <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuinedForever" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuinedForever">Ruined Forever</a> at the CMC not getting their revenge on Babs. As mentioned,  I know what it's like to be bullied and to lash out at my tormentors. It never did me a single lick of good,  so getting back at the bully by bullying frankly doesn't help and it'll just make things even worse in the long run. The moral WAS right as far as telling how NOT to deal with bullies went.
