            @Seraphem - Im laughing because we had actually joked about burning down the whole shed for one spider.  He has a picture of it <a class="urllink" href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lvdaseXdP1E/T8OXili50II/AAAAAAAAEao/V5zf-FAK-1I/s899/IMAG0008.jpg">Black Widow Spider<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>â—Š</small>
<p></p>He saved me from the spider but he also broke my 100 dollar Chef's knife... hopefully the company will replace it under the warranty.

            The CMC would have to have a really good reason for skipping school though... like Visiting Grandma in the Hospital or something for Big Mac to protect them like that?
<p></p>Or is it a case of they really just had a day off from School and AJ forgot?

            @Sky No,  I figured the ep would be from the CMC's point of view,  and Big Mac would seemingly be chasing them down in a terminator-esque fashion.
<p></p>Then it's revealed at the end that he was chasing them down so persistently in an attempt to protect them from AJ. The CMC just didn't notice out of fear

            I was just trying to think of a moral,  and I figured the moral would be ABOUT skipping school (or something similar)
<p></p>So the CMC WOULD be skipping school,  but they'd be doing it with well-meaning intentions.
<p></p>As I said,  I figured that maybe there would be something passing through Ponyville that they thought they could get their cutie marks in,  and if they stayed in school they'd miss out on it.

            Okay,  there was just one new chapter of Fluttershy's Basement since I last checked and while I wouldn't call it <em>clop</em>,  let's just say that it earned it's "mature" rating.

            I dont see the CMC being able to carry an entire series on their own... but perhaps a movie length show where they earn their cutie marks finally.

            eh i'd have no issue with ANY pony spin off till i see how well they doi it,  even a CMC one.
<p></p>Hay,  if nothing else it would most likely remove the need for them to write CMC centered episodes.

            One spinoff series someone here suggested was a Braeburn/Trixie show. Braeburn moves to Canterlot to help sell goods from Appleoosa. He has to room with an out of work magician,  Trixie. Sitcom shenanigans ensue.

            The CMC have <em>definitely</em> been better this season.
<p></p>And I have a lot of trust in the writers. While not all episodes have been equally good and some were less good than I expected,  I've always at least <em>liked</em> every episode.
