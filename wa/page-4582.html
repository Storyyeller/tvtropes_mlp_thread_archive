<p></p>Yeah,  same here.  Characters with bad traits don't have to be be bad people.  Of course,  disliking someone isn't necessarily bad either; I don't think less of Ginger or Mousa for disliking Pinkie and Rar... <strike> <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumorMode" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumorMode">no,  I totally do</a></strike>.  Just harping on a character's flaws and ignoring their good parts,  though,  is annoying.

            By the way,  out of curiosity I looked through the WA forums. It looks like there is a total of 759 other threads. And we dwarf their combined length.
<p></p>Edit: Now of course I'm tempted to figure out a way to count the total length of threads in this forum just to see what it is.

I kind of dislike Pinkie Pie (as in,  she's my least favorite of the Mane 6),  but I laugh at her antics pretty often,  so what the hey. I also have a love for fashion,  so disliking Rarity is like sacrilege,  especially because her lifestyle and goals I can really identify with.Oh well.
