            Poison Joke isn't magic.  We don't have any way of knowing how Celestia would react to it.
<p></p>The "Want-It,  Need-It" spell only works as long as somepony looks at the object the spell is cast on. With all the chaos going on,  Celestia probably didn't even notice the Smartypants doll and just cast a counter-spell.

            I didn't notice that she was an alicorn,  actually.  That's my bad.
<p></p>Anyway,  I'm sure Celestia has very high magical resistance.  If she was made to drink the potion,  though,  it might still affect her - probably not anywhere near as strongly as it did Mac and Cheerilee,  but it might still mess with her.

            I see the whole thing with the potion as like a similar situation in Negima.  Asuna has Anti-magic,  but eating candies laced with love potion still affected her (though not as strongly as it would have otherwise).

            It might have been a princess from the G3 era. Think about it,  in that horrifically written time,  they had a ponyland utopia with magic and technology and less dangers than most worlds. And then an unspecified apocalyptic event broke their civilisation down and reduced them to the Three Tribes we saw for some years,  before they managed to reunite and found Classical Equestria,  some time before Discord attacked.
<p></p>Given how irresponsible some to the g3 ponies could be,  it is not unreasonable to believe that this Love Poison would have set off <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes">Disaster Dominoes</a> that reduced their Ponyland society into tatters and eroded their unity in a world where only the Earth Ponies remembered their agriculture.
<p></p>But then again I play too much with interlocking all the generations of ponies together,  so feel free to disagree.

            That's a good way to see it,  Dragon Ranger.  If it was introduced to her system directly,  even Celestia would probably have trouble with it,  though she'd probably still be conscious of what was going on and that it was a problem.

            Maybe the original Love Poison was created to be a lot more potent. Obviously the CMC could not recreate a Poison that could affect a goddess,  but it worked fine for normal ponies.

            I assume the poison would work on Celestia. On the other hand,  I could easily buy that she would know exactly what it is by magically sensing its effects and not drinking the stuff.
<p></p>I don't assume that she has immense magic resistance. On the other hand,  if someone like Twilight tried to forcibly move her with magic,  she could easily use her own magic to completely cancel out through sheer force if she wanted to. Try to levitate me left? I'll push myself right,  and I'll also drop a rock on your head that I just carved an elegant FRIENDSHIP into with magic.

<p></p>Celestia casually walked right up to twilight through her hurricane of magic that was affecting literally every other sapient being in the room in wildly extravagent ways. It didn't even touch her.

            Discord is a non-Euclidean form of Wild Magic that the ponies have every reason to fear as it defies the studied consistencies of their own natural magic.
<p></p>I read Negima too,  and Asuna clearly demonstrates the double-edged nature of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalFantasyTactics" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalFantasyTactics">having 0 faith</a>,  that being that while you are immune to magic attacks,  you also cannot be healed or buffed by normal magic.

            @Lurker: there are many kinds of magic. The magic of arcane casting,  the natural magic to coax nature to play along with your desires,  the magic of cunning that lets you pull convincing illusions,  the magic of unifying your talents with those of your friends and making miracles possible,  and the magic of telling aa good story that helps you win hearts over to your cause.

            Did Celestia ever look at the doll? I felt like she just popped up and canceled the magic out with her own magic. Maybe if she'd looked at the doll it would have done something to her.
<p></p>And red,  yeah,  I'm pretty sure Asuna got hit with a breast expansion spell once.

            Discord is a corrupted Chaos God that has become completely irrational. There should be a Positive Chaos god to complement the Harmony,  but Discord is not purifiable by the Elements of Harmony. They need a more powerful purifying agent.
