            I see enough "Pony Fetishes" on Ponibooru.  I wish I could unsee it....
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">And as far as ''seemlessly integrating into pony society" goes,  we really have more evidence to the contrary than we have for it. Gilda clearly considered most ponies "lame",  and Iron Will was called a "monster" several times,  only to be corrected by the more understanding Fluttershy.</div>
<p></p>... Okay,  that's a good point.  I'm tempted to point out that Gilda still had a lot of ponies attend her party (and not one of them said "A griffon?  Wow!") and Iron Will had a big,  all-pony audience,  but still,  good point.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">And how in the world is Lord of the Rings a good example of your view of things? Men,  Elves,  and Dwarves were all of equal standing, </div>
<p></p>Except for the whole "elves and dwarves were dying out" thing and how man was the only species to go everywhere while the others mostly stayed in small enclaves they were comfortable with.
<p></p>Although it was probably a bad analogy,  since elves and humans apparently have enough in common to produce crossbreed babies.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">there's nothing wrong with that,  but as everyone else already pointed out that analogy is horribly flawed to the point of being Insane Troll Logic,  none of those are sapient species,  Griffins/Mules/Dragon et al ARE </div>
<p></p>And again,  that's the problem.  Don't create an all-pony society and suddenly have Griffon Bakers.
<p></p>Gilda being a rare griffon who was somehow able to become pony-intelligent?  Works.
<p></p>All griffons being like that?  Gets weird.

<p></p>it's only wierd if we ever saw any evidence Griffons weren't naturally that way.
<p></p>again,  you act like every corner of the planet is run by ponies,  when we have in show proof that Equestria is a country. The few non-ponies we see are simply immigrants/tourists from non-pony countries/regions that have another species as being dominant.
<p></p>also,  the Elves are a REALLY bad example,  they were the dominant race before man showed up,  and they weren't dying out they were just saying "Screw you guys,  We're out of here" and leaving for there own land. And the Dwarves were never said to be dying out,  yes certain tribes were having issues but there are plenty of refrences to others that are still going strong.

            Also,  the reason we see so few members of other races is probably because long distance travel in this world is still relatively difficult.  The fastest method we've seen is train,  unless you have wings,  so few members of the griffon/zebra/whatever race would bother to make the long trip to the center of pony territory.

            The issue may be that some people are just so used to being spoonfed everything relevant by the people who think <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">Viewers Are Morons</a> that it's hard for them to realize when that isn't in effect,  and where stuff not explaicitly presented can exist......which is a very VERY rare occurance anymore.
<p></p>as such,  we see only pony country,  there for only pony country exists. Have I mentioned how much I hate that crap? (the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">Viewers Are Morons</a>,  spoonfeeding us stuff) and how much i <strong>LOVE</strong> this show for not doing that?

            As for the situation with Cows and Sheep,  I've seen similar situations in other science fiction and fantasy works. They're <em>client races</em>,  meaning that they depend on another race for something and provide a valuable service in return. Cows provide milk and Sheep provide wool,  in return for the shelter and protection that they are not entirely capable of themselves,  lacking the magic and strength that the ponies have. They are not denied any rights that a pony would have,  and we've seen cows walking around Ponyville independently on at least two occasions.
