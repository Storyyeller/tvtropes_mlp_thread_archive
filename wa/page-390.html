            They sell Celestia's dolls. That's why I doubt she is evil.

<p></p>I know in my heart she won't be evil. It's just there's a lot you could do if she did become a villain. My favourite idea being Twilight finding out about Celestia's evil,  then writing a final letter about friendship to her,  as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Badass Boast</a> or something

            I don't see anything wrong with her trollish attributes as long as they're kept at the level at which they actually appear in the show.  It also doesn't bother me when people make fancomics or write fanfic in which Celestia is actually evil and just likes to torment those around her.  My issue is when people take the exaggerated,  evil Celestia and trying to treat it as canon when I can't see any reason to do so.  I get that there are questions that can be raised about Celestia,  but it's pretty obvious that in canon she's not supposed to be evil.
<p></p>Same deal with shipping; I'm fine with pretty much any pairing until people go and try to treat their <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackPairing" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackPairing">Crack Pairing</a> as canon.

<p></p>No,  like,  I'd really like to develop that story. So a gipsy fillie summons Luna and makes the wish of a gypsy male. She agrees,  but on the condition that she tribute to her her first born. She gets the man,  gets pregnant,  has the kid. Kid is white as snow. Male gypsy calls adulterly,  kills the girl,  and abandons the kid (we'll need to bowlderize that). Luna raises the kid from the cosmic distance,  with magic and white light... There's more,  but please give the song a chance.

            Topic for discussion: What if people in our world had cutie marks,  or some equivalent?  Imagine that at some point in their lives an icon appeared on people's shoulders that represented what you're really good at—what you're born to do.  Would the world be a better place for it? Would it make a difference?

            How many people do you know who truly know what they want to do with their life? I don't think it would change anything,  really,  because not enough people would have one. Or,  if it was just there from the moment you were born...hm.

            That would be very interesting.  For people who'd found what they loved to do,  though,  it'd just be extra reinforcement - a bonus,  not a goal,  or so I feel.  Plus,  humans wear clothes. =)

            That's the idea behind putting it on the shoulder,  instead of the thigh (which would be human equivalent anatomy for a flank).  If it's on the shoulder,  you can cover it up with a T-shirt,  but it's easy to reveal if you choose to do so.
<p></p>An interesting thing about cutie marks is that since they're pictoral,  they're not necessarily straightforward to interpret. If you get an hourglass,  for example,  or a candle (as we see in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.equestriaonline.com/2011/06/updated-cutie-marks-liststill-more-to-come/">this list of cutie marks<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>),  what does that mean?

            Evil!Celestia: Like others before me,  I don't see it. Or rather,  I can surely see the technical possibility,  but for the kind of story the show is,  it would actually be a bad move. Not all stories need cynicism on that level. Hence,  the creators of the show won't do it and shouldn't do it.
<p></p>If a story contains a seemingly benevolent authority today,  LIKE FUCKING CLOCKWORK the fandom will start create theories,  no matter how epileptic,  to explain who they are REALLY evil or tyrrannical or liars. This is easy,  since true benevolence is kinda hard in the real world,  there are always side effects,  always other views,  and because of that it is hard to do in stories. I think there are a fair amount of Evil or Corrupted or Tyrant Celestia fanfics in ED; seems to me be the most common epic fanfic.
<p></p>I actually think many girls would buy an evil pony princess doll,  but then it should have to be evil-cool,  not all pink and shit. Something like Nightmare Moon or Midnight Devilwitch Bling-Bling: <a class="urllink" href="http://yamino.deviantart.com/art/Midnight-DevilWitch-BlingBling-199291069">http://yamino.deviantart.com/art/Midnight-DevilWitch-BlingBling-199291069<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> ;) (Girls,  like boys,  do the weirdest shit with their toys,  after all. I know one woman who more or less decided her Barbie-knock-offs lived in the world of Thundarr the Barbarian and had to defend their little suburb against her brothers action figures,  and one whose Pocahontas scalped her Barbie...)
So if they do Tyrant!Celestia she should have a transformation sequence into a cooler doll. Hey,  then the girls' parents will have to buy TWO dolls!

            Man,  you ponies post a lot while I'm at work.
<p></p>Anyway,  if I can chime in on a discussion that was over hours ago,  I like what Red Savant said about Celestia only being able to imprison Nightmare Moon because she couldn't fully utilize the elements.  So if she needed Twilight to learn friendship to master the elements,  it seems haphazard to just send her off to Ponyville and hope she runs into a bunch of ponies that exemplify the other elements.  We know she likes to partake in a bit of Batman Gambitry,  so is it possible she's been working behind the scenes in Ponyville for years to make sure the right five ponies are there and ready to run into Twilight?  After all,  that checklist Celestia gave her directed her to most of them,  so she could have made sure the mane ponies were in charge of all the things Twilight had to check on.
