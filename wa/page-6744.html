            @Blue 1. That didn't come up much except for when Cadence flies across that gap or whatever. So not much of a change.

            <span class="blue">Alright,  elaboration a go:  I'm gonna pretty much quote myself from last night.  A lot of sci-fi/fantasy works tend to deal in a whole lot of exposition and info-dumps to characterize their settings.  This tends to put the focus on the world while not putting enough focus on the characters and plot,  creating a stale,  inconsistent story.  Other works,  like MLP:FIM,  develop their setting purely through</span> <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell">direct evidence, </a> <span class="blue">relying on the viewers to <em>infer</em> further info about the setting.  This both causes the viewers to become more engaged in the story and allows their imagination to fill in any accidental plot-holes,  resulting in an over all better defined setting.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">So basically,  I don't think the show should ever pause the story and <em>explain</em> to us what it means to be a princess and where alicorns come from.  We know what they are,  we know what they do,  that's all we need.  We can fill in the rest ourselves.</span>

            Do you think this is the best episode to show to people in order to get them interested? I know someone who I'm sure would love it if you actually watched it,  but she has absolutely no interest,  apparently due to a beleif that it is just like the old generations.

<p></p>The fact that he was voiced by Christopher Lloyd voiced him.

            Yeah,  I think the only think the show might have alluded to is that alicorns are born and/or they age at a similar/same rate as regular ponies. Evidence: Cadance ages from Twilight's imagine spot to the present day. I don't think alicorns are created from normal ponies anymore just because of that short scene.
<p></p>The writers are really good.

            @ storyyeller   Only if you desperate.  Better something from s1.  From season 2 I think best is cider episode,  because it funny to see ponies drinking beer like drink.
