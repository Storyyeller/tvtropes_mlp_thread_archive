This is still two independent companies,  here. And technically they could still do that if they hiked the price up enough.
<p></p>The thing about the Flim Flam brothers is that they may be travelling for the moment,  yes,  but if they want to make a decent living they need to settle somewhere - they were ready and willing to settle into Sweet Apple acres,  remember? Flim Flam Fields?
<p></p>I'm just saying,  there was a perfectly reasonable solution that benefits both parties and ultimately gets them what they want... and they didn't take it. I'm not judging them for it,  I get that the apple family may very well have not wanted to give up on making Cider. I'm just saying,  the solution was there.

            Yeah,  but that's the thing: They wasted apples to make the cider. Which means that the low sales of apples must have come from demand,  not supply - otherwise they could simply sell the apples needed to make the cider. So with Flim and Flam around,  suddenly they have winter demand again.

            I think the Flim Flam brother's biggest problems are that they're a bit lazy and shortsighted.  They have a legitimately good product that could make them rich,  all they need to do is mass produce the thing and lease it out to farms.  The farms would have increased cider production and the brothers could just sit back and let money roll in,  but that would require some hefty overhead costs and take several years to see significant results.  They seemed more interested in short term gains,  hence their tendency to roll into town,  bilk as much as possible and then leave.  I'm not entirely convinced they would have stayed even if they got the farm.  They probably would have just sold it and left.

            This mostly came down to a case of narrative convenience. They needed to get both parties to get into conflict over the cider. In order to accomplish that both sides needed to come across as terrible from a business sense.
<p></p>Either way though,  while the Apples aren't exactly living the high life they don't seem to be hard pressed for money most of the time.

            I think the Rich's do more than just sell apple farm products. Its they sell the Zap Apple Jam,  but that was just money to "grease the wheels" as it were. They've got to have other business prospects. Hell,  Flithy explicitly says he owns a place called "Rich's Barnyard Bargains."

            @kegi What I meant is that I was under the impression that the Flim Flams ALREADY have loads of orchards under their belts,  or at least had a some sort of deal set up with most of them.
<p></p>Basically,  I assumed the Flim Flams worked like this:
<p></p><ul><li> 1.) They enter a new town,  demonstrate the power of the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SSCS6K" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SSCS6K">SSCS 6 K</a> and win over the locals.
</li><li> 2.) Offer the 25/75 split deal to the local orchards.
<ul><li> a.) If they accept then they set up a machine there and leave.
</li><li> b.) If they refuse then they set up shop and import apples from the other orchards they've made deals with/taken over. They then run the local orchard out of business and take over
</li></ul></li><li> 3.) The Flim Flams move on to a new town and repeat the process.
</li></ul>

            I'm guessing they make a lot of money.
<p></p>But a lot of it has to go back into keeping the farm healthy.

            I imagine the Flim Flam brothers were probably under the impression that,  "Oh,  well,  trees grow apples on their own!". They weren't really aware how much <em>work</em> the farm would actually take. Their inventors,  not farmers.
<p></p>You know,  I kinda wonder if that machine can do other stuff? It seems like making cider is a very narrow application if they really are travelling ponies. Maybe it can change functions depending on what they need it to do. Swap out a few part and bam! The cider maker is suddenly a,  I dunno,  travelling musical show! Or a clothing producer!
<p></p>@Ginger: Hm. Okay,  that's a fair point. I can see that,  actually... Seems like an odd business plan,  though. I mean,  I guess they want to make as much money as possible,  but past a certain point I just don't see that any more than a few machines would be necessary.

<p></p>As gingerninja 666,  mentioned. The brothers were 'traveling sale ponies'. They had no intention of staying or farming,  they wanted to use available resources to make profit. If they were farmers they wouldn't have asked Applejack for a bushel of apples.

            @Ginger:  The way they were set up as traveling charlatans,  I assumed that they came into town,  made as much as possible and left.  Granted,  I'm basing this a bit on the character type,  and their machine was higher quality than is typical for their kind,  but they don't seem like they have substantial assets around Equestria.  And if they did,  I'd find it odd that AJ hadn't heard about the brothers who'd been snatching up apple orchards.

<p></p>The unicorns relied on magical and technolgical solutions to harvest and produce food,  disregarding the land and nature (much like TS did back in WWU,  though her's was far more benign). The Apples always kept to their time tested and hard working methods,  which where rewarded with far better output.

            Eh,  I dunno. I'm not sure I like how <em>pushy</em> that makes them. Oh,  I like them being sinister - but I like my slimy villains. I like them worming their way into a town,  making a quick profit and slinking away.
<p></p>I love the con-artist archetype. Not sure why. But I do really like the idea of Flim and Flam pulling a quick job before they invented the machine... a card hustling table in Canterlot,  perhaps. Lordy,  can you imagine how useful being twins would be to conning?
