            I'd say to some extent the guy makes some good points mousa.  He's right to a degree.  Many of the adult fans have behaved as if the show is for them and thus tried to commandeer that and present the show as something it isn't.  On the other hand,  Lauren Faust stated her goal was to create a show that could be enjoyed by anyone.  I think a happy medium would be to,  rather than clamor for more of what we want which many fans seem wont to to do,  would be appreciate the show for it's merits and keep to ourselves rather than try to "convert" people to a non-existant cause.  I'm also a little tipsy so ignore me if I'm not making sense.

            @Drenius and Applelight,  Yes,  it's me,  in the flesh,  I've been drawing superheroes for the past like week. And my two friends are back from their universities. I'd show you all my progress but... The computer hooked up the scanner is throwing a fit right now so I need time to install it onto my laptop.
<p></p>In the meanwhile I've been reading through the debates on the Prejudice is Magic tumblr and becoming enlightened.

            <span class="blue">@Mousa: I more or less agree (except that the show was made not only for little kids,  but also for their parents,  which many of us are the proper age for,  even if we don't actually have kids).  I do think this fandom has a problem of not bothering to try and keep things kid-friendly or give any sort of warnings that the works they produce are adult-oriented.  And I think we shouldn't try to "claim" the show for ourselves,  we're not the intended audience.  I hate reading posts people making claiming that the show is "not really for kids, " trying to imply that it was secretly made for adults all along as a way of excusing their watching it,  it comes across as rather insecure.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Although considering all cartoons are made BY adults,  who typically try to make the show something they enjoy (unless they just don't care),  I don't think there are many cartoons you could really claim are ONLY for children,  even if they're meant to be officially.</span>

            Yeah,  for my 2 cents,  the only aggravating thing was that it basically negated a <em>really</em> big fandom nod.  I mean,  Derpy was basically <em>created</em> by the fans,  so seeing her actually get a speaking role was just about the biggest thing the show could have done as a nod to the bronies.  I still think the fandom blew the change <em>massively</em> out of proportion,  but I can understand why they wouldn't be happy about it.
<p></p>And yeah,  I think he's a little <em>too</em> specific in the "this is only for kids" target of the show; the people who made it specifically noted that it was designed to be at least watchable by adults.  But yeah,  the primary demographic is young girls,  and we shouldn't expect the show to cater to us instead of them.  And honestly,  I wouldn't want it to anyway; I enjoy the show because it's unique in that regard and changing stuff like that would probably reduce the appeal to me.

            Ooh,  Hey Blue! Guess what? I beat Persona 4!
<p></p>...well,  I got the bad ending. Then my roommate looked up the path to get the good ending,  so I'm working on that now. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> I'm in Adachi's dungeon.</span>
<p></p>The path to the good ending is <em>stupidly</em> specific... I mean,  it's one thing to pick the killer,  but needing to get exactly the right conversation path to get there? Seems a bit too narrow to me.
<p></p>But 75 hours into the game and I've finally found something to complain about? Not bad.

            I hope to be around more often to,  I just didn't have any reason to contribute before.
<p></p>The tumblr's been running on fumes,  been using my deviantart contributions to make up for a lack of new content. I haven't had a new brain blast like when I did the 10 at once
