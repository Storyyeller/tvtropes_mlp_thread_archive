            Of course,  these are ponies far tougher than the soft,  entitled G3 ponies. They've had to survive in a world that's so hostile and full of megafauna that they had to manually control the climate to make things habitable. Also the Talents of Equestrian ponies are a racial power,  it'd take world-changing magic that alters the fundamental rules of that particular existance to completely negate their Talents. Suppress,  maybe. Cancel out,  naaaaaah.
<p></p>Between an angry Night Goddess,  a Chaos God,  a Fae Queen leading her hive on a feeding invasion,  <em>and</em> a brutal and cunning dictator who may be as bad as <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaManZero" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaManZero">Weil</a>,  they're more than prepared for otherworldly invaders they'd have much less qualms about destroying since they aren't natives or ponies and are clearly a threat.
<p></p>After two seasons of dealing with their insecurities and fears,  they'd find it much,  much harder to drive them to despair. Heck,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadokaMagica" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadokaMagica">KYUBEY</a> would be more successful because the wily little fluffball could easily take advantage of his cute animal appearance to deceive them with omitted truths and trick them into making Contracts with him.
<p></p>...Besides,  you're taking the characters at their face value. By attacking their friends,  you drive the <em>other</em> ponies to stand up and protect them,  drawing out Harmony's latent power in the protection of friends.
<p></p>You also take Fluttershy at her face value,  which means you discount her well-hidden force-of-will and courage.
<p></p>By targeting the other ponies,  you target Dashie's friends,  awakening her latent Loyalty and driving her to face and overpower her fears and insecurities,  reaffirming her ability and strengthening her.
<p></p>Rarity would willingly be broken rather than let her friends suffer too,  demonstrating her Generosity.
<p></p>Pinkie would realise her friends need their spirits to be bolstered despite her sadness and would find a way to cheer things up somehow.
<p></p>Applejack has learnt to face harsh truths,  and would steel herself because she knows her friends wouldn't fault her for trying her best since she's done it before.
<p></p>Twilight has gone through the breaking game once,  <em>without her magic</em> to boot. Round II would be less successful especially if her friends step up to support her. After all,  Friendship is worth fighting for.
<p></p>With all the Harmony combined,  the Sha will enjoy the Skittles-flavored taste of the Final Harmony Blaster.

            I other words only the Sha of Anger would have a chance and ONLY if he tries to get them to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrikeMeDownWithAllOfYourHatred" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrikeMeDownWithAllOfYourHatred">Strike Me Down with All of Your Hatred</a> in order to feed OFF their anger and rage and even that dosen't garranty a win since in order to win he has to get all the ponies of ponyvile riled against him and even that may not be enough anger depending on how powerful The Elements of Harmony are.

            Now that I think about it,  Sombra was likely one of the last villains Celestia and Luna faced together,  and the biggest strain on their relationship— <span style="font-size:83.3%">one or both of them may have looked into the nightmare door and saw the other betraying them,  or how failing their mission (the city they sought to liberate disappearing) may have caused them to doubt their own (or their sister's) abilities</span> —pushing their already-withered bond further to the breaking point (i.e. when Luna became susceptible to whatever transformed her into NMM).

            I now am under the impression that Luna was all SRS bzness while Celestia was more open to her subjects,  The rift between them started when celestia was more popular simply for being less strict.

            Imagine a group of villains trying to turn the Ponies against their Element of Harmony in way that's different from Discord:
<p></p>Twilight is turned into a technology obssesed pony(villain assigned to her brainwashes her by giving evidence that Magic itself defys physics and considering how Twilight initally reacted to seeing her future self appear before her eyes she'd end up being corrupted easily).
<p></p>Rainbow Dash is reduced to hiding behind her friends at all times in fear due to being straight up brainwashed into making the opposite choice from Discord's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a>(as in betray Cloudsdale instead of her friends)
<p></p>Fluttershy is turned into a whiner(infact the villain in charge of corrupting her outright states he is going to turn her into a whiner in order to use her horror at the prospect to corrupt her)
<p></p>Rarity is turned into a gluttonous slob(according to the dictionary Generosity is graciousness not just sharing,  a gluttonous slob that shares isn't gracious and thus isn't Generous) due to an endless bag of hotdogs being thrown in her path.
<p></p>Pinkie is scared into not laughing(do to the villain assigned to her beating up and threatening her)
<p></p>Applejack is corrupted into a thief(stealing is another form of Dishonesty) due to the villain assigned toher waving an addictive smelling apple in face then brainwashing her while her will is weak.
<p></p>I think the Ponies would triumph over these villains(considering Twilight's being brainwashed into never using magic and how the villains are the type to MURDER the 3 pony princesses the SECOND they teleport into the villains' palace to undo the brainwashing how that would happen I may or may not reveal later)

Especially since the window was already made and in place by the time Twilight and crew got back.

<p></p>Villain assigned to Twilight:The Embodiment of Technology and Physics who owns a huge robotic Terracotta army using technology and a knowlage of Physics he corrupts Twilight against her element before the other ponies are corrputed.
<p></p>Villain assigned to Rainbow Dash: The Embodiment of Treachery he uses his minions as shields and backstabs or abandons his allies(if they can be even be called allies) when he deems it profitable.
<p></p>Villain assigned to Fluttershy:The Embodiment of Cruelty and the most pure Brutal Honesty in existance he tortures Fluttershy and outright admits that he's going to turn her into a whiner to weaken her for the brainwashing.
<p></p>Villain assigned to Rarity and Applejack:The Embodiment of Slobbiness,  Gluttony,  Greed and Dishonesty not mention being the rival of Fluttershy's corrupter(for obvious reasons) who robs from everyone,  never tells the full truth(he calls a nice day a horrible day and vice versa) and is an unsharing complete gluttonous slob.
<p></p>Villain assigned to Pinkie Pie:The Embodiment of Insanity and Generosity in every meaning of the word he gives things away in a panic once he knows he has it,  is quite gracious to his guests,  hates making messes, hates getting blood on himself and gives generous beatings to his guests when they slight him by laughing.
<p></p>Villain not assigned to any pony:The Embodiment of Loyalty,  Indifference and Practicality he sees his minions and allies as tools that will never ever {Outlive their Usefullness} and keeps them alive so that he can use them again and in the event they somehow DO die he still won't abandon them instead he'll find a use for them even as decoration for his chambers. He serves his superiors out of duty not love(he'd have no qualms about executing the should anyone of them backstab him).
