            Not arguing they weren't,  just that it DOES work with what we've sen so far,  but yes it COULD have been done better with them,  but it wasn't all that bad. Though unlike you i LOVED the last two chapters.

<p></p>The only time the Enclave came close to being competent was when Colonel Autumn showed up,  and does everyone remember how long HE shows up for?

            Weirdly it seems to be agreed that AJ is Thor and Rainbow is Captain America in the pics I've seen.
