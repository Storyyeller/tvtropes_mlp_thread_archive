            Death,  if you ARE taking in that scene,  then you know it confimrs she ISN'T this was NOT wonderbolt training,  this was a week long tryout to show their stuff. nothing more
<p></p>The original end of WBA was Dash admitting what was apparently not clear enough from the episode that,  as above,  this was just a chance to show the wonderbolts what you got,  not actually trying out for a slot on the team. Saying that while she wasn't a wonderbolt yet,  she was now near the top of the list for when they DO need to recruit a new pony. And showing LD simply got demoted to wingpony.
<p></p>The general idea of why it was changed seems to be that it showed LD getting off to easy for being a sociopath.

A sense of,  "hmmm this would be a good idea." But she is able to see the future to a degree and make little hudges to help achieve better outcomes. The one that Lauren specifically stated was her acting on that sense,  was making Twilight's entrance test be the egg hatching. Since that wasn't the normal test.</div>
<p></p>Yeah,  I was sort of basing the headcanon on that and then expanding on it a bit.

            Just curious,  has anyone checked out <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPvbZqrY9AQ">this Sindarin translation of the intro theme<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>? The singing's not great,  but it's more about the Pronunciation and he surprisingly got it fairly accurate. The word order's slightly rough,  but would be pretty comprehensible if someone fluent in Sindarin read it.
<p></p>I've done some translation work for a few songs and dialogue bits in Quenya,  but my singing and Pronunciation  is too rough.  Still,  it would be pretty awesome to hear Luna Eclipsed dubbed into Sindarin or Quenya as having Luna speak in the Valinorean dialect would work well in contrast to the rest speaking in say,  Noldorin or Third Age accents.
