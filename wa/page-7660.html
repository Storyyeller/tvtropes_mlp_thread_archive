            Well like I said the holes straight through are less inportant then the ones that break up the outline,  so all you would need is some dent like parts along the edges. Don't even have to dent in,  can build up the area around them insted.

            I suppose that's true... it is sort of the male equivalent of Scratch/Octavia.
<p></p>Well,  it's the sort of thing I call on consistenly,  but I'd never actually <em>write</em> about it. I prefer my shippings to be more unique,  which is why I gravitate to the background ponies.

<p></p>I assume you mean x^2,  not x^1. Anyway,  you aren't supposed to actually solve for x,  you're supposed to use the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. I don't remember the exact formula of the top of my head,  but it's really easy if you have it memorized. Of course,  in this case the numbers are small enough that you can find the solution just by trial and error. 13*1 + 23 = 36 = 6^2.

            Yeah,  I feel the same way. Probably not the male equivalent of Octavia/Vinyl,  but,  well,  it's like the token gay pairing. Along with Soarin/Braeburn,  which I oddly do not find myself throwing a hipster sneer at. Though I have no intentions of writing it or anything on account of the whole "it's been done" thing.
<p></p>Though I do admit I have an idea for a Doctor/Derpy shipfic. Won't write it anytime soon,  though. I have enough stories I'm working on.

<p></p>Uh,  what? I just gave a solution. Anyway,  you should look up Quadratic reciprocity. That's what you'd use if you had large numbers like if you wanted to say,  find if x^2 = 337 mod 4999 has a solution.

            @ storyyeller: I meant there was no solution with the method that we were supposed to have. Since we don't get calculators in the test either,  so everything had to be done by hand. But I solved a similar problem using the Euclidian Algorithm. I should have noticed that it didn't work for that particular problem from the beginning. That should have told me immediately that there was no solution using the method...
