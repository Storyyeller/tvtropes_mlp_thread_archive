            About the magic as related to cutie mark discussion,  your mixing up the connections. It's not unicorns get magic based on there cutie mark. It's they get magic based on the special talent,  and a cutie mark that is based on there special talent. The Cutie mark and Magic have no direct effect on each other,  but are both effects of the same cause.

<p></p>Getting the Cutie Mark signfies the moment when a Pony finds their special talent right? That one thing they are so great and wonderful at,  clearly there is something magical about a strange symbol just appearing on the flank of a animal,  so I am suggesting that for Unicorns getting the CM "locks them in" to magic about their special talent.

            @L Mage: So if a unicorn never discovered their special talent,  they would become a powerful magician?  Maybe Trixie's cutie mark is fake...
<p></p>@Ginger: Yes.  Pretty much all of Pinkie's songs.  Remember,  though,  Pinkie as a character just doesn't really appeal to me.

            Good episode,  now I wait for HD episode to load on YT.
<p></p>Nice to see Pinkie being anoyed by somepony for most of episode.  And tose  babies are cute.
<p></p>And finaly mixing races is canon and not only that,  parents don't need to be same race as childeren. I love Mr. Cake when he explainded that fact,  like was  trying to be sure that those two are his foals.

            Just saw the episode,  and here's my thoughts in order:
<p></p>Ha ha,  Pound Cake can fly better than Scootaloo!
<p></p>The stage music is the same as from the play in Rarity's cutie mark story.
<p></p>I would never,  ever in a million years babysit those two,  and I regularly babysit a family of four hyperactive boys.
<p></p>They're prodigies!
<p></p>What did Ginger think of this episode?

            No,  the cutie mark has no direct effect on there magic,  getting one does not "lock them in" to a certain type of magic. Rather they were always limited to certain magics simply due to there biology and personality,  those exact same factors are what create the cutie mark once the pony realizes what they mean. unicorn's magic and Cutie Mark are both results of the same thing,  but have no direct effect on each other.

            Then why did Twilight's surges in magical power stop (to our knowledge) after she got her Cutie Mark? If was assume her freak out in Chronicles was such a surge as she and Rarity where refrenceing then why didn't she leave it behined in tolderhood? Also what possible talent to levitation and walking through walls point to?
<p></p>It makes more sense that their magic is just out of hand until they figure out their special talent and "lock into" it.

            Twi's freak out didn't end because she got her Cutie Mark,  she got her Cutie Mark because the freak out caused her to discover how talented she was at magic and realize that was her special talent.  As to the baby,  who says it will,  yes at that point it's just raw magic doing random things,  but it isn't getting a cutie mark that limits these down,  it's simply growing up,  as they grow up and develop there magic slowly narrow down to those things that they are best at,  and once they realize what these are consciously they get a cutie mark.

            new point,  there are two things that govern Cutie Marks,  what a pony is naturally talented at and enjoys doing determine what,  and there conscious realization of exactly what that is determines when. A unicorn's magic however is governed only by the first of those. but yes it does get stronger and better at it after there CM,  due to them now consciously knowing what they like doing and starting to hone there magic skills along those lines
