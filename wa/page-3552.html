            I am actually curious about Cadence. If the Season Finale really is about her,  and she really is an alicorn in show,  we might <em>finally</em> learn something about alicorns. All we know now is the two we know and love are possibly immortal and super powerful.

            If the season finale really is about Cadence,  then it shoots down my idea that the elements of harmony make the bearers immortal. Which says bad things about the future if you ask me: Discord is unlikely to be so stupid if he ever gets out again.

<p></p>Well....at least in theory there is nothing stoping the Elements from passing to new bearers that prove themselves worthy.

            So tightrope walking is a bitch to do in <em>Skyward Sword</em>. Got the hang of it though,  and tried to fight a Moblin on one.
<p></p>I fell into the abyss,  unsurprisingly.
<p></p>And that Fluttershy art fills me with dirty thoughts that which I am not the least bit ashamed of.

            Certainly,  but Discord would logically still break out at that point. If you could just redo the seal,  then Celestia would have told them to do so,  right? Unless she simply forgot. Which would be... bad.

            Yeah,  I think the cast works better in their capacity as normal ponies.  Anyway,  I think the Elements of Harmony probably find new bearers whenever the old ones get unaligned.  Or even before they get unaligned; they were still linked to Celestia when Twilight and the cast got them.

            I wasn't saying that the show's <em>not</em> aired in Anachronic Order.  I'm just saying that the show begins in the middle of summer,  so unless there's more than one year in the timeline,  there's no <em>way</em> they fit all of the episodes into the short period of green between June and,  say,  September.

<p></p>When I got Skyward Sword the controls drove me up the wall. Nothing worked quite right,  my bird would constantly stop in mid-air and just flap about while slwoly falling through the coulds,  swords strikes wouldn't follow what I was doing and Link would take a mountain of persuading before he'd get into the pose for rolling bombs. It was partway through the Earth Temple when everything just sort of clicked. Since then I haven't felt the urge to thrust my wiimote into my tv.

            @Arha The only reason that situation happened was because Celestia wasn't aware that her seal would eventually break if she gave the elements to someone else. She didn't piece together what happened until after Discord escaped.
<p></p>Also,  it took Discord about a year to escape after the mane cast got the elements. Now that they know what happens when the pass on the elements. It's a simple enough situation to remedy.
<p></p>Just get the new bearers to use the elements on Discord's statue as soon as possible. Bing. Done

            Shrug,  maybe. You're making assumptions,  though. They may be logical assumptions,  but there's no particular reason to believe that blasting statue Discord will keep him a statue.

<p></p>Either way,  we can't/shouldn't really add a VA without confirmation,  and IMDB doesn't count. We still don't know who voices Mr. Cake,  for example.
