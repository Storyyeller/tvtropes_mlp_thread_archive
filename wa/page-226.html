            This show is coming on soon on channel 919. I've never seen it before. I'm going to give it a watch since I've been hearing about this show non-stop on the Internet. Someone on a different forum wanted me to add it to my list of the best cartoons of all time. I've also been hearing about it here on TV tropes a lot. My brother tells me its just an ok cartoon but I want to see what I think of the show.

            So it happened: I let my love of this show get the better of me,  and now I've gone and added 'Ekines' to the races present in my worldbuilding project.
<p></p><strong>Ekine</strong> <br>A species based upon equine (horse,  donkey,  zebra) genetics that is generally noted as one of the galaxy’s more peaceful races. They appear to contain genetic material from a huge number of other species implemented into their DNA,  and the results are three distinct breeds with distinct biological and (on a planet by planet basis) social roles. Regardless of breed,  all Ekines are approximately 2”6 to 3”6 tall and have long,  rectangular faces,  pointed ears and large eyes. They walk upright and possess hooves on their rear legs in a manner similar to various mythological creatures such as Satyrs. Their arms end in somewhat unique ‘hands’,  where the material making it up is of a similar strength and nature to hooves,  but disconnects into three smaller ‘fingers’ to allow the gripping of objects. They also all possess manes and tails.
<p></p><em>“Bleh,  Unicorns,  the prissy little gits. I swear that half of them just spend their time reading. The other lot spend their time farting rainbows.”</em> <br>The first breed,  ‘Horned-Ekines’ (sometimes unofficially known by their traditional name of ‘Unicorn’) possess a unique organ: a single large horn,  protruding from the forehead. This horn produces and stores aether within itself,  allowing a ‘unicorn’ to temporarily give themselves an injection of the substance straight into their brain without having to consume it externally like other species. Most unicorns produce only one kind of aether (based on their lineage),  but a few seem to be born with two horns that jut out in a ‘V’ shape,  one of each. Needless to say,  these individuals are usually treated as either blessed or cursed,  depending on the culture.
<p></p><em>“’Oh look at me,  aren’t I wonderful,  with my obnoxiously large wings?’”</em> <br>The second breed,  ‘Winged-Ekines’ (sometimes unofficially known by their traditional names of ‘Pegasus’ or ‘Pegasi’) possess large,  powerful wings which dwarf the rest of their bodies. They also possess lighter bones as well as organs which produce a light-weight hydrogen based gas,  as well faster than average metabolisms. These factors combine to allow them flight,  though some are better at it than others.
<p></p><em>“Ya know what,  I can’t be bothered mocking these pansies any more. I mean,  come on: they’re just big,  right?”</em> <br>The third breed,  ‘Earth-Ekines’ (sometimes unofficially known by their traditional name of ‘Dray’) do not possess unique organs or appendages. They do,  however,  possess much greater physical strength,  stamina and size: they are,  on average,  3 to 4 foot tall and possess much stronger and heavier muscles &amp; bones. Many of them also have a tendency to walk on all fours when travelling casually or in a hurry,  much more so than the other breeds (this is generally felt to be due to their greater weight and bulk).

            Ah,  I finally found some ponychan links that still work,  on page 77.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/nohots.png" class="embeddedimage" border="0" alt="">  Do they have some kind of expiration timer on those?
<p></p>I was also reminded of how I didn't <em>quite</em> guess the secret twist of "A Bird in the Hoof"'s ending until Phelomina... Filimena... whatever exploded (and what a comically timed spontaneous combustion too!).  For some reason,  even though I knew this twist from Ivy the Kiwi,  my brain got stuck at "Uh,  I bet Filemina's <em>supposed</em> to be like that?,  and... Fluttershy's going to kill her with kindness or something?"
<p></p>But whenever anybody discusses it,  they mention Harry Potter,  and I'm like "Oh.  Yeah.  There was a phoenix in Harry Potter.  And I didn't really care enough to remember."

            I heard there was some kind of 4chan raid on ponychan or something like that a while back (I'm not 100% sure on this,  I think it might have been before I joined in on the fandom,  so this is mostly hearsay) and my guess would be because ponychan got messed up,  the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDs">I Ds</a> for the pictures may no longer be the same as before,  turning them into broken links.

Haha,  if this show ever did a "mirror universe" episode,  then Evil Celestia could turn out to be that recurring supervillain that everyone's expecting,  just like Darkwing Duck's Negaduck.  You just know she would have some punnerific name like "Mourning Star" or "Black Hole Sun" in her powered-up form,  too.  Might be too scary for the kids,  though.

            Evil Celestria can be cool part of show but I think better than MU version make her possesed by same evil what got Luna.
<p></p>And Evil Celestria could act just like Tyrant Celestria fron fanon.

            Well yeah,  that would be a fun opportunity to put in the "iron tyrant" that everyone jokes about.  But when you talk about "possessed by evil",  then you have to explain where that evil came from and what its purpose is.

            What everypony think about my Dragons teory posted in WMG?
<p></p>Dragons have 3 subspiecies/races mirronig ponies.
They maybe have similar abilities what ponies have (plus dragons powers). Also not counting other dragonlike creatures. So we have:
<p></p>- Wingless Dragons : Spike race,  maybe have some connection with ground,  animals and plants.
<p></p>- Winged Dragon : like Red and Green ones,  propably can walk on clound and control wheather.
<p></p>- Horned Dragins: unssen ,  with some magical powers (maybe like Dragons from D&amp;D).
<p></p>Also as a bonus (if we asume that Sea Ponies are part of MLPFIM setting)
<p></p>- Water Dragon: Steven Magnet kind,  they don't need to have hair.
<p></p>BTW Why Habsro dooesn't relise toys of monsters from the show? That would be mega awesome.

            You know,  I really still like a prefer hearing things like Japanese video games in original Japanese. But that's only because I like seeing things in their original language,  and because I enjoy hearing things in foreign languages. Nothing to do with any belief that Japanese voice actors are somehow better and more talented,  that would be silly.
<p></p>And I really like Tara Strong's Rikku. Final Fantasy has pretty good dubs,  thank you Square USA. And it was definitely a great decision to use Tara Strong. As I've played the Final Fantasy X games in both Japanese and English,  I have to say her voice really brought out Rikku just as she is. Good job Square Enix. Though I've got to admit they did a terrible job with Star Ocean 3.
<p></p>Speaking of which,  I really want to see the French dub of Friendship is Magic.
<p></p><em>Edit:</em> OMG,  SHE DID PRESEA IN TALES OF SYMPHONIA. OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG. TWILIGHT SPARKLE IS PRESEA OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG.
