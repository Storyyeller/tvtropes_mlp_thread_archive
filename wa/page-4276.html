<p></p>I doubt they've changed. And Ginger,  don't worry. You're so far ahead you could disappear for months and still be in first.

            @ginger You shouldn't feel pressured to post. You happen to be a large figure in this community,  so you'll have a large post count. And it doesn't really matter if you're not the top poster.

            I don't know why you assume we're all terribly fast readers,  Ginger.  I top out at  between 1 page every minute or a page every two minutes.  I actually enjoy hearing the narration in my head as well,  as it were.

            Catching up on thread:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> She percieves the past and the present as if they're happening simultaneously. So sometimes she forgets where in her own timeline she is,  and needs to concentrate to remember forward to the present.
<p></p>when she first appears she joyfully squeals and hugs Celestia,  saying that she hasn't seen her in weeks. Celestia seriously tells her that it's been over a thousand years and Chrona starts thinking to herself,  her expression growing darker and darker until she finally remembers that she's become a villain.
<p></p>I don't know,  I liked the idea <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16"> </div>
<p></p>This is a really cool idea.  Wouldn't really work for MLP (except in a fanwork) but it's very interesting.

            So next week Pony shows a new episode in it's new time slot. When exactly was the show moved to? With all the time zones different people are in could you just say two hours from now or something to avoid having to work out the math?

            The new episode sounds great.  People sure are negative around here whenever a new episode synopsis is posted!  Reading back in the thread,  it seems as though most people are assuming Hurricane Fluttershy is going to be an exact clone of Dragonshy... all from reading a one sentence synopsis.
<p></p>Honestly,  I don't even understand how anyone could think that.  Dragonshy focused on the entire team,  with Fluttershy being dragged along against her will and only being useful at the end.  Hurricane Fluttershy presumably will star only Pegasus ponies since it is about the weather team,  meaning Fluttershy and Rainbow will be the only members of the main cast to get much focus,  and I find it unlikely Fluttershy will pull the same stunt she did in Dragonshy,  since then she's been willing to come along anytime her friends needed her,  despite her fear.
