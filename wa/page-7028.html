Please no. I think this would be the only episode I wouldn't bother watching. I'm not a fan of the pets.

            I'd say that he wasn't exactly OOC in PYHD,  but it was exaggerated way too much. We've seen him be picky and demanding before,  so that was nothing new. The physical violence was what really put it over the top (even though I'm a terrible person and thought it was funny).

<p></p><span class="blue">I think people always look at this the wrong way.  We know Rainbow Dash trains long and hard to become a better flyer,  and is completely self-motivated in this.  She doesn't have anyone telling her to train,  she does it on her own initiative.  But when she's NOT training,  she prefers to simply lie around and relax,  which is pretty reasonable considering the extreme workouts she goes through regularly.  So all the time we see Rainbow Dash lounging around looking lazy,  it's just because that's how she chooses to spend her free time.  I don't believe we've ever seen her actually slacking off when it comes to work of any sort.</span>

            @Blue Yeah,  I know. It's just that she's really the only one we ever actually <em>see</em> lounging around in their free time,  everypony else keeps busy with other things. Combine that with her laid back personality,  and it gives off a massive air of laziness. She wouldn't be worthy of the Element of Loyalty if she was lazy to the point of avoiding work,  though. She just doesn't do much else.
