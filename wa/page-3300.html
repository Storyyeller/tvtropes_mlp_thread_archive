<p></p>Yeah,  especially since it was never before mentioned until now.
<p></p>@Ginger: I love villains too,  these ones just seemed pretty weak to me.  I mean they got done in by their own stupidity and excessive need to be a dick.  They could have just started competing.
<p></p>So did anyone else think at first that they might actually be part of the massive apple family?  They both have apple cutie marks...

            @Ginger I love villains too.(I said the same thing blue spade said lol)
<p></p>People get confused imo. There are characters athat you are supposed to dislike. if you hate a character in a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate">Love to Hate</a> way I think it's a sin of a good villain as by hating the character you are enjoying him in a sense.
<p></p>But if you hate a character becuase it's boring and unninteresting that's another completely different thing  ( a sign of bad wrtiing or a bad quality villain).
<p></p>You can love villains and stil disagree with them after all.The flim flam bros are good villains imo

            @Ginger: That's <em>possible</em>,  I suppose,  but given that it's never even been mentioned before now and apparently is only sold during a short time period,  I'd assume that the majority of their income comes from elsewhere.  Yeah,  it might be important to stock up on cash right before winter,  but I doubt that it makes up <em>too</em> sizeable a portion of the farm's income.  Basically what I'm trying to say is that it make a lot more sense for the family to look into alternate revenue streams before just abandoning the farm.

            I have not seen any pictures but the whole concept of Bustyshy seems wrong to me... I think Pegasi in general would be not so well endowed.  It'd make it easier to fly.

            @Blue Well, 
<p></p>1.) we'd been absolutely STARVED of proper villains recently,  so that's probably the factor. <br>
2.) I absolutely <em>loved</em> their <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong">Villain Song</a> (I've listened to it about 33 times already) <br>
3.) I'm a big fan of slimy manipulative types. Which these two had down awesomely. <br>
4.) I couldn't stop myself from feeling a little bit bad for them at the very end

            @Blue re:Bustyshy
<p></p>That's the point. It plays on the fact that Fluttershy isn't a normal pegasus,  and is more similar to an earth pony (which most artists give big knockers to) than to her own race. She's one of the scarce Pegasi humans who'd have a big chest.
<p></p>Also,  she's not a confident flyer. Bg knockers would be one possible reason why

            I just don't get the slim!fluttershy idea. (especially since that appears to be the consensus around here) She fits a more motherly,  curvaceous mould. Since it contrasts so well to have incredible outward features mixed with an EXTREMELY meek personality

            @Ginger: Ah,  good. Nice to know I'm not alone in sizing them up for a couple of nice pairs of leather pants.
<p></p>Let's see... orphans on the streets of canterlot,  maybe? Eked out enough to survive running cons on stupid nobleponies? Discovered a knack for tech somehow,  or happened to win that fancy-pant machine of theirs off a bumbling inventor? A mentor of theirs left it to them?
