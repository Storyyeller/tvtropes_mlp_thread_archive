            well it's not so much "get" there powers,  as learn to harness the power they've always had with-in them.

After that there's nothing but societal squick keeping it off limits. Plus they never actaully went thrgouh that,  nor do they remeber having gone through it so for them the imprinting doesn't exist.

            Alrighty,  time to bite down and read chapter 6.
<p></p>At the end of the last chapter they were getting ready to listen to the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog">Apocalyptic Log</a> from the stable they were going through. I imagine there are going to be a <em>lot</em> of these sorts of things. Wonder if it'll have any relevance to the plot.
<p></p>Time to read!

            @Ginger: Seraph is right. They've all had the power the whole time and have even been using them on a basic level,  but this is where they learn more of what they can do. Well,  with the exception of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a certain yellow pegasus we call Fluttershy</span> who gets a little boost.

            Scootaloo is more or less my favorite character in the fic at this point,  if only because she rants at one point about <em>everything</em> I hate about what the setting has done to the characters. Of course,  said setting is more than likely going to turn around and crush her for that,  but it was cathartic as hell.

            AJ assumes that ponies are good natured. They normally <em>are</em>,  except in FOE,  where corrupt businessponies crawl out of the woodwork to undermine her and betray Equestria.

            except we've seen what a bunch of self absorbed,  imbecilic plot-holes the "High society" ponies tend to be. Not hard to see some of them doing stuff like that.

            @Some I am familiar with the plot. But some character choices are rather surprising. And certain <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch">PlayerPunchs</a> actually hurt when you can identify with the characters that much more.
