<p></p>BUT THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH THE BEST EPISODE EVER.</div>
<p></p>It does seem like Trixie got more distilled.  I was hesitant about this episode at first too because I found her to be one of those characters that was just more annoying than anything whenever she opened her mouth â€” which is one of the reasons I like her so much in fanon,  because the personality comes through minus the more grating parts of the voice.
<p></p>By turning into a straight-up villain,  her voice adjusted and she actually got considerably <em>less</em> irritating.

            @Blue: Generally it was pretty well received across the board.  The worst response I've seen was a "eh,  it was okay",  and those seem to be mostly people who aren't fans of Trixie to start with.
<p></p>Personally,  I think it's the best episode of the season thus far.  Although I actually disagree about Fluttershy.  I did like a fair bit of what she did,  but I kinda feel like they overdid the "scared of stuff" bit a little.  I mean,  if there's one thing that knocks her out of "too scared to move" mode it's seeing her friends endangered,  and I thought it was odd that she was so reluctant to help. Not that it was OOC for her,  but I though that they took it further than they needed to.

            Sonic Rainboom is generally well received,  although I think it's far from the series best episode.  I actually think this one is overall a bit better than SR; Fluttershy was a bit exaggerated,  but she wasn't nearly as bad as Rarity was in Sonic Rainboom.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I don't think she ever did a unicorn-type spell.  My headcanon is that she's capable of utilizing magical plants to create enchantments and such.  Like she enchanted her cup to refill itself.  I don't think that she could do some of the spells Twilight and Trixie did,  though.

<p></p>Yeah,  I really like the angle they took.  Instead of subtle passive magic like earth ponies,  she's got this stealth stuff that just kind of quietly happens when nobody's looking.  It's fucking great.
<p></p>My headcanon is that zebra magic is SCP-173.  Except instead of disemboweling you,  it does stuff.  It's like the ultimate trolling magic.
