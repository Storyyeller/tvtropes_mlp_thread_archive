            @Badwolf I guess it's just that I find the mystique aspect more interesting. They've built it up around Celestia,  so I think the payoff we'll get when we see her true nature will be more satisfying than it was for Luna <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            So would Horses essentially be the 'Giants' of this world?

            I'm guessing magic then.  Actually,  the "quick evolution" thing kinda makes sense; if Celestia and Luna were born thousands of years ago,  it makes sense that they'd look different if that was the case.
<p></p>I think the other difference in perception between the sisters is that Celestia is unequivocally the ruler of Equestria.  Luna obviously has some power,  but Celestia is the one the ponies have seen ruling Equestria for years,  and Luna doesn't seem to be nearly as involved in running the country.  Therefore it's easier for the ponies to look at Luna as a peer (well,  they give her token respect for being a princess); all of their interaction with her is centered around her attempts to ingratiate herself.

            My implied question was supposed to be: "How much free time do you think she has?" Celestia's depicted as having almost no time for herself because she's always so busy. I can't imagine Luna being like that. Is there any Royal Work that she needs to do?

            Considering that Nightmare Moon's legend morphed her into a cannibal pony-eater,  I can easily envision the fear that a Pony would have for a Horse.  Especially an enraged Horse.
<p></p>Horses are essentially the giants nowadays.  But it's far more complex than that.
<p></p>What I have in mind:
<p></p>In the First Age,  two proud Equine races ruled the lands of Equestria in harmony:  Horses and Alicorns [see separate entry for Horse and Alicorn].  Alicorns,  less numerous,  led the hiearchy and formed the noble-class,  leading their Horse-kin in founding the once-great realm of Equestria.
<p></p>Horse-kind formed the working-class - tireless,  strong,  brave.  Led by Alicorn officers and Nobility,  the Horses harnessed the earth and dominated it.  The Great Army of the First Age ensured that all citizens of Equestria lived,  worked and slept in absolute safety.
<p></p>In harmony,  the two Equine races inter-married with one another.  And a curious thing happened.  Offspring of this perfect union formed... Ponies.
<p></p>Alicorn mystics were befuddled by this matter.  Tiny foals,  who grew to full maturity with a mere fraction of the stature of their progenitors.  Theyy  were different in other ways.  Some had only wings,  others had only horns,  and some had neither.  Thus,  was born the equine races of Pegasi,  Unicorn,  and Earth Pony.
<p></p>-excerpt from Ancient Equestrian Lore
<p></p>Alicorns used to be taller,  so they were pretty much the same height.  Might show some long-abandoned ruins from that ancient time and ponies are all "wow,  they made everything big here" or something.
<p></p>They inter-bred,  and the result was pony-kind - earth ponies are much like their Horse parents,  while Pegasi and Unicorns got wings or horn traits from their Alicorn heritage.  Some were born as Alicorns,  although smaller in stature (we can debate that part).   As a result of inter-breeding,  pure-blood Horse and Alicorn populations declined rapidly,  until both were virtually extinct.  Celestia and Luna are (well,  could be)purebloods.  Heck,  Celestia could be old enough to recall pure-bred Horses.
<p></p>Anyway.
<p></p>Horses are thought to be long-extinct.  Their closests genetic off-spring are Earth Ponies,  as they're both fairly mundane.  Earth Ponies have inate magic,  though,  as they have tracees of Alicorn blood in them.  Twilight may have read about all of this at some point,  whereas Horses had passed from history into legend,  legend into myth.  It's no longer common knowledge.
<p></p>Now I just have to figure out where the heck Zebra Ponies came from.

            @ Applelight: They look about twice as big as a standard boar,  have two extra tusks and a horn. They also,  as the name suggests,  have access to thunder magic. Oh and a few plates of bone around their necks.

<p></p>No.  Horses do not have cutie marks.  Since there's no humans,  they also have no branding marks.  They go by a given name based off of their trade.
<p></p>I still have a lot of junk to work out as how horse culture is going to be.  Apparent cultural sophistication goes Canterlot &gt; Ponyville &gt; whereverthehellhorseslivenow.
