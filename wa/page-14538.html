            Banshees are a rather underused monster,  I think. They're cool and creepy. They must have really sore throats,  though.

            Well,  I'm not the best of bakers,  but I  do have two I'm pretty good at making.
<p></p>The first is a triple layer fudge and caramel cake. Which is made with a homemade mix baked separately with a small hole in the center of each which is later filled with a chocolate cream. I mix caramel and chocolate into a frosting I use to stickthe layers together.
<p></p>The second are my special cupcakes. The main part is made with cheesecake I make from scratch stuffed with chocolate chips with baked oreo crumbs and extra creamcheese put on top.

<p></p>I saw those in the article Ace linked. Certainly an interesting type of undead that needs to be added to D&amp;D and an intriguing option.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">A brain in a jar (which according to my copy of Libris Mortis,  is a type of undead). </div>
<p></p>Ah,  yes. I don't think that would fit though.

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">A Worm That Walks (technically an Aberration,  but it's essentially a pile of worms that's possessed by a ghost)</div>
<p></p>... point. Hmmm... intruiging. Maybe a bit much though.
<p></p>I'm thinking that corporeals would work better than non-corporeals as well.
<p></p>Something that the mane six can't meaningfully interact with,  of course,  loses some points.
<p></p>EDIT:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Using illusion is fine,  but still IMO without would be cooler. But I guess he need to appear normal to others.</div>
<p></p>The <em>last</em> thing he wants to do is appear as <em>normal</em>. He needs to show off his perfect and divine body. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">It is meant to be worshipped,  after all.</a> And idols in his image need to be erected throughout the world. Clearly his great,  great,  great ... etc ... grand-nieces are wasting this nation.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> And for Grief Syndrome,  it appear to real action is in multi,  but you can play solo at early difficulties without problems ,  play as non Sayaka to have interesting game play fun,  and play as Sayaka if you want to beat that game :D.</div>
<p></p>So Sayaka is really powerful,  huh? It's great seeing her get some love,  but that's kind of the opposite of what makes her awesome in the show.

<p></p>The lich isn't going to be created by Nightmare Moon. He will be created by the others as a response to the discovery that Luna has betrayed them. From the alicorn that Luna and Celestia hated more than any other. Morning Star. Alicorn of Hedonism,  Self-worship and Temptation. And a former holder of the Seat of Venus (now owned by Cadance).

            About finding the date of Pinkie's birthday,  according to Equestria Daily,  the way that was figured out was not by using the airdate of Party of One,  but by using the airdate of A Friend In Deed.  In that story,  she mentions that her own birthday is in 75 days,  so they counted 75 days after that episode first aired and came up with May 3.  Which doesn't necessarily coincide with Party of One's airdate,  making things rather confusing between the two episodes.
<p></p>And to Pinkie...Happy Birthday!  Hope you have a great party with lots of friends and cake!

            Actually,  that explains why Pinkie "forgot" her own birthday: she <em>didn't</em>,  the rest of the cast just got the date wrong and she rolled with it.
