            If I was a pony,  I'd probably be a unicorn. I doubt I would get use to hooves right away and having the ability to control objects would be a useful tool. As for my name,  I think it would be easier if I just stuck with my normal name.

            We all make money by forming a roving troupe of performers and story tellers,  filled with tales nopony has ever heard before.
<p></p>as to the Hasbro/You-Tube thing,  1. The video doesn't prove the ALL the takedowns were official. 2. All it does is state Hasbro's "official" policy,  which they have to take that policy for legal reasons and to make there shareholders and lawyers happy. Seems to me if they were really serious about it there'd be a lot more takedowns,  and they also haven't told EQD to stop linking to them,  so seems to me they do a random few takedowns very now and then to keep the lawyers happy,  while being lax enough to still let bronies see them
<p></p>Of course if they were really smart they'd make all the episodes available for free,  internationally from there website,  just with commercials added for add revenue.

<p></p>Edmond Dantes is a cool name,  so of course I would use it.
<p></p>That being said,  I honestly have no clue what I would do as a pony in the pony world.  My main hobby is video games and do they even have those?  So I guess I'd hit up Twilight's library and read a bunch,  just out of sheer boredom if nothing else.  Trying to hit it up with the girls would wait until I feel more comfortable.
<p></p>And I don't even know who the heck I'd pick.  Waving somewhere between Twilight Sparkle and Fluttershy,  with Pinkie as a possible third.
<p></p>Or I could totally be demented and attempt some form of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">Wife Husbandry</a> with the Cutie Mark Crusaders.  I think Mousa has a claim on Sweetie Belle though.

Just remember,  meeting <em>Pinkie Pie</em> naturally would involve her ambushing you in the middle of town,  then throwing you a welcome party exactly twelve minutes and thirty-eight seconds later.

            Who would I hit? Probably Fluttershy since she's the kindest of the bunch. If that doesn't work,  I would probably go for Rarity next. Aside for her drama,  she seems fairly level headed and kind.
