            @nomuru: I read it,  and I agree with the guy who said you missed the point. The idea was that it wasn't Twilight's place to reveal their secrets: they needed to be honest with each other. If anything,  Twilight shouldn't have blurted out their secrets,  but instead try to talk them into doing it themselves.

            Pinkie Pie wasn't wrong,  you know. Think of what would happen if Twilight told Fluttershy about Rarity. Or if she told Rarity about Fluttershy. It would have fixed one mess (maybe),  but start a completely different one.
<p></p>And you can't say Twilight didn't try to fix things without spilling the secret.
<p></p>^^ She goes one step further and does a Pinkie Pie Swear.

            But that's the thing - she didn't even say anything about that! If she told Twilight that they needed to tell each other on their own,  then Twilight wouldn't have frickin' gone nuts throughout the course of the episode talking to them. Instead she's basically doing the equivalent of "YOU'D BETTER NOT TELL THEM YOU MADE A PROMISE I SAW IT >("

            It occurs to me,  you and I know what they should have done,  but maybe <em>they</em> didn't think of that? (Well,  Rarity and Fluttershy did,  eventually.) They're only <strike>human</strike> pony,  you know.

            I think I've figured out the genetics debate from a few pages back. Unicorns,  Earth Ponies,  and Pegasuses (pegasai?) are genetically identical. An embryonic pony has the potential to become any of the three types of ponies,  and will develop a horn,  wings,  or sturdier muscles/bones depending on conditions in the womb (I think there's some sort of amphibian whose offspring has their gender selected through similar means,  right?). Normally that'd make pony demographics very sensitive to temperature and diet,  but given that the ponies manually run their entire ecosystem,  it makes sense that they'd somehow be able to consciously control what the overall trend in pony types is,  to ensure an even balance. This explains why the Apple clan is completely comprised of Earth Ponies - apple farming is the family business,  and Earth Ponies are best at that,  so they petitioned whatever organization controls what type a pony becomes so that they'd all be Earth Ponies.
<p></p>Princess Celestia has a horn and wings because she's of a Precursor-type species compared to the other ponies,  from before the mutation that caused individual ponies to only exhibit one trait rather than all three.
<p></p>...
<p></p>...Did...did I just say "pony demographics?" What is this show doing to me? 9_6

            I kind of agree and disagree with Nomuru at the same time here. On the one hand,  Pinkie's behavior was frustrating and illogical(not that we've come to expect logic from her,  but hey),  and yeah,  the plot as it was would have been resolved if she had told one or the other,  but on the other hand,  I don't think Twilight should have told them. They more than likely would have forgiven her,  or even thanked her for telling them,  but it was their problem,  and their choice to solve it. I think that the plot would have been perfectly fine if Twilight had been debating the issue on her own - it was Pinkie's incessant insistence that the secret must be kept at all cost that lessened it. Really,  I think that Pinkie was acting pretty harshly out of character here - she embodies laughter,  after all - you know,  fun? It was obvious that her behavior was directly or indirectly making three of her closest friends absolutely miserable,  and could easily have lead to a serious conflict between Rarity and Fluttershy. It may have simply been a case of poor communication between her and Twilight,  but that's still a baaad Pinkie Pie.
Readers Digest version: Pinkie's behavior and insistence that Twilight not reveal the secret was unacceptable,  but Twilight shouldn't have told the secret anyways. Hint,  maybe,  nudge the two towards it,  sure,  but ultimately it was something that they needed to do on their own.
<p></p>That aside,  I'm actually rather taken with the episode. Rarity's little fits are always kinda fun,  and after reading a couple of comments that I thought were sarcastic,  I was worried that Fluttershy was going to get a swollen head and become a total primadonna,  but she stayed her lovely self the whole way through. Yay. Not to mention Photo Finish's complete hamminess.

            On the whole,  I agree. This episode got to me. However,  it bothered me far,  FAR less than 'Feeling Pinkie Keen' did. I take it there was an uproar of sorts on that episode. Where is it? I would like to see it.

            I just found Pinkie Pie hilarious this episode. What with her popping out of a pile of sponges just to say "Forever...",  or the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockVisualMetaphors" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockVisualMetaphors">Visual Meta</a><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaphorgotten" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaphorgotten">phorgotten</a> of her eating that apple. That was just to funny for me to find frustrating.

"I would like to see an episode maybe looking more into Pinkie Pie's character or past,  as someone said in this thread (or the YF) that she seemed the least characterised,  mainly used for humour."
<p></p>Well the episode Cutie Mark chronicles will explore at least a little bit into that with them going around asking the main cast how they got their cutie marks. Oddly this is the episode of the known ones that haven't aired so far that I'm most interested in despite the seemingly dislike of the CMC. I think it has a potential to put some interesting stuff about our main cast,  not to mention the potential for adorable if they show flashbacks of the the cast as baby/kid ponies.
<p></p>Also wondering if we'll see any background babies as younger. Baby Derpy anyone? oh and maybe we'll even see the Parents that Lauren talked about. Though if they do it shouldn't be in just the flashback otherwise we'll be left with questions on why they aren't in Ponyville unless they answer that within episode as a sort of sub-plot though I guess having all the parents would warrant it's own episode anyway.

            Hmm? Pinky Pie did get a bit of characterization right in the pilot,  with her "No Fear" song. I actually thought it was a pretty interesting one,  too; a girl who was formerly easy to scare was taught laughter as a stress-relief mechanism and made it pretty much her identity.
<p></p>PS: I adored this episode. Pony Gaga was amazing,  Pinkie Pie was hilarious,  and Pinkie Pie was <em>really</em> hilarious. And so were Rarity and Twilight.
<p></p>PPS: So does the ending mean that Spike/Rarity is now canon?

But,  didn't Spike just ignore Rarity's presence in some episodes? I know that his crush on her wasn't the plot's focus. But still,  it seems like his feelings for her varies accordingly. Maybe they will make it more obvious from now on.
<p></p>PS: I can already imagine fandom [[Squee squeeing]] after a baby Derpy appearance in the background.
