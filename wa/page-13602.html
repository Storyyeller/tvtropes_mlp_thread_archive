            Yeah,  given that the spell targeted the elements specifically,  I'm guessing the cutie mark shifting was a symptom of the problem rather than the cause.  Specifically,  it seems that the roles the cast were meant to fulfill were shuffled around,  and the CM's simply changed to match their new roles.  Keep in mind that the elements are cutie mark-shaped.  It wasn't so much that AJ got Rarity's cutie mark,  so much as that AJ was shoved into Rarity's "role",  and got stuck with the cutie mark as a result because it's a visual indicator of Rarity's role.

            Alright,  now how is this going to affect the show next season?  Will Twilight still be able to spend her time bumming around in Ponyville now that she presumably has princess responsibilities?  I mean,  the show can't just shuffle her off to Canterlot,  the whole point of the show is her interaction with the rest of the cast.  I guess finding a balance between her friends and new job will be what the season 4 premier focuses on.
<p></p>Also:  Derpy!  Good to see you,  even if it is for such a brief moment.
<p></p>Also also:  Really liked Dash's enthusiasm over Twilight's new wings.  If there isn't an episode with RD teaching Twi some flying techniques I'll be annoyed.

            The writers already said that they wouldn't be breaking up Twi and her friends.
<p></p>I'd say she'll stay in Ponyville,  with the occasional plot where Celestia helps ease her into being a full Princess.

            @Smasher: General consensus seems to be "Overall good,  but should've been a two-parter".  Basically,  it wasn't one of the series' best,  but it was hardly a disaster either. Most of the complaints have been people who still haven't gotten over the the Twilicorn thing.

            Yeah,  my thoughts on the princess Twilacorn thing is that it isn't where I would have liked them to go with the character and I kind of think it was imposed on the show for the sake of toys,  but there's potential for good stories in there and I think the writers are good enough to not screw it up.  So bring on season four already.

            Thank goodness for youtube. (If the list seems a bit randomly ordered,  it's because I'm just listing off my impressions of the episode as I remember them.)
<p></p>"Liquid pride". Gotta remember that one.
<p></p>Probably my major complaint is that this story feels <em>really</em> squashed the way everything's crammed into 22 minutes. This is feature film material,  guys!
<p></p>I can't tell what exactly got switchroo'd with the cutie marks,  but it's definitely not their special talent. Everyone seemed bummed out with what they were doing,  and were doing a pretty craptastic job.
<p></p>Lyra seemed unusually enthusiastically jumpy. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cRUVXVyfQ">(Or maybe she's still waiting for Twilight to say "ciao" back?)<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<p></p>So many callbacks. Continuity FTW.
<p></p>First thing she does as princess? Look for a reference guide. Yup,  still the Twilight we all know and love.
<p></p>It doesn't seem to confirm <em>or</em> deny whether alicorns are part earth pony (at least explicitly),  but I'll just keep assuming they are for the time being.
<p></p>I like how each of the five cry happy tears differently.
<p></p>They really went all-out musical on this one. I think I prefer it this way compared to the usual mostly-normal episode but with everyone suddenly breaking into song at a certain point.
<p></p>Can it be season 4 now? I want to see what effect Twilacorn has on the show.

            <span class="blue">@Smasher: It was fine.  Basically a good episode with the same flaws that tend to plague the show as a whole.  If you like the show,  this episode isn't much different.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Out of all the "special episodes" (premieres and finales) I'd rate it somewhere in the middle.  Better than the season 1 finale and season 3 premiere,  not quite as good as all the others.</span>

            Yeah the only legit complaint beyond generic "Twilacorn is mary sue stupid bad" is it was rushed and should have been a two parter.
<p></p>But that said,  it was simply packed with feels. It wasn't the strongest episode overall or story wise,  but the emotional punch of it was,  was just amazing.

            Did anyone else think Twilight and Fluttershy were going to just walk off and leave Rainbow Dash tied up in the cottage?  When they started to walk away,  I was like,  "Um,  hello?  What about the pony tied up in the pot?" RD said <em>exactly</em> what I was thinking at that moment. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            And yeah agre with Blue,  while it does seem a bit squished for a single one,  it wasn't quite enough for two without some real padding. The speed was one of the things that made the feels so powerful IMO
<p></p>And now I have to get ready for work :(
