<p></p>Admittedly Applejack should've made "no wings" an explicit rule from the get-go instead of bringing it up after she lost.  Even so though,  you'd think Dash would've respected the fact that A.J. doesn't have wings and that this gives Dash an unfair edge.
<p></p><hr>
<p></p>Now that I'm going into analysis mode,  I did think about two things not related to the "<a class="urllink" href="../wa/page-3033.html#post-75811">turning points<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" I mentioned before.
<p></p>One,  Applejack wants to raise money for Ponyville,  but after she reveals the truth... she heads home moneyless.  Why didn't she and the Mane Six just stay at the cherry factory and keep working with her to help build up the money faster?
<p></p>Two,  Rainbow Dash I can see pulling a wagon... but <em>Fluttershy?</em>  I mean I guess they figured they might need to fly at some point,  but she was honestly the last pony I could see being a wagon-puller (I know,  she pulled a wagon in "Feeling Pinkie Keen",  but that was to cart a lot of frogs around and didn't necessarily demand speed.  This would've been physically taxing for her).  Only thing I can figure is,  they must've guessed they'd need flight at some point... or else Fluttershy was just in <em>that</em> state of mind.

            @Applejack Pony: To be honest Applejack Pony I think most people liked this episode. I think most people like the episodes. It is just that some people. . .like me are loud and obnoxious with their dislike. I'm sorry,  if I've been a problem and making you feel terrible.

<p></p>@Ginger: That's the same thing I though.  I mean,  she apparently got in the top five or so in <em>every</em> event in what's apparently a national competition.

It's actually pretty similar to Applebuck season; her greatest fear is letting other ponies down.

            They have been solidifying the world for a while,  though,  so yeah few things in the episode surprised me. Well,  except for Derpy being canonized. There goes the 'Where's Derpy' game.
<p></p>Applejack is a character whose identity is wrapped up in being good at what she does and dependable,  so it totally makes sense for her to refuse to come back home when she loses. She does need to learn that her family and friends value her for who she is even when she's not always awesome or fails them - not making other people worry is also an important aspect in relationships. I can also understand her friends freaking out and pestering her. Just disappointed that the big gun is sicking Pinkie onto them instead of,  oh I don't know,  Applebloom.

            @Applejack Pony - Are you sure you're not misreading people's reactions?  I know I've been analyzing it and saying it marks a turning point... but that IS NOT the same as saying "its a horrible episode."  Far from it,  in fact.  Give people a chance.

That one was pride based. (but her unwavering desire to help others only compounded the problem)
<p></p>This one,  yes,  definitely about not letting others down.

            Again,  as I keep having to say,  you have to make adjustments for media induced restraints,  in this case,  yes there grilling AJ went a bit hard a bit quick,  but it HAD to due to media restrictions,  in this case as in so many others,  time. I'm sure if there was time to show it the Mane 6 would have started slower and took more time to try and talk it out before setting into some of the stuff they did.
<p></p>Secondly,  even then they were concerned,  if one of your best friends suddenly moved away,  completely changed,  and you could tell there was something wrong they needed help with,  wouldn't you do everything you could to find out what was wrong so you could help them? Sometimes to be a friend you need to help other friends even when they don't want it,  same theory as behind an intervention,  sometimes you just have to resort to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughLove" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughLove">Tough Love</a>. Especially if said friend has a habit of keeping there problems to themselves until they grow much much bigger then they should be allowed to,  the Mane Cast knew AJ well enough to know that if she wasn't willing to talk about it,  it meant it was problably something that she really needed help with but would never ask for,  so they knew what steps they had to take.

            On the subject of Derpy... I honestly don't mind how they characterized her,  or her voice.  I just hope they don't start shoehorning her into every episode,  because so far the only personality we've seen is that she's a <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisaster" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisaster">Master Of Disaster</a>,  and such a one-note character (or should I say "<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun">a one-trick pony</a>"?) would get grating after the second or third time you see her.
<p></p>Unless they actually develop her somehow.
