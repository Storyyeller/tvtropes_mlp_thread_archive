            If that was Upper Crust,  then Fleur could easily be his actuall wife.
<p></p>I kind of like Fancy Pants as the man-on-top too. Maybe he and Celestia have a necessary evil thing going on - she knows he's doing good,  even if it's technically illegal,  and she knows he's skilled and has connections,  so she occasionally uses his business to her own ends? Like,  getting information through him,  which he in turn gets through underworld contacts? It seems like it would be a fairly small order for say,  a spy in a business in a neighboring country to also pick up a little bit of local gossip that doesn't make it to their neighbors.

            I think it's just that Ponies are really just very innocent creatures,  which leads to a large degree of cultural naivete. They don't really pay attention to current events or history beyond what interests them personally and all the other things already discussed.
<p></p>IMO It's because ponies never have to outgrow a sense of childish,  innocent,  naivete like humans have to as they grow up. Mostly becuase
<p></p>1.) Ponies are just such naturally sweet innocent...people? ponies? whatever...so there's not a lot of drive away from innocence from there own society,  (I.E. little to no pony on pony crime,  violence,  con-artists or other things that make people cynical)
<p></p>2.) Any significantly major threat from without or within is handle by there resident physical goddess. Essentially ponies never have to fully (from the human perspective) 'grow up' and move out of mommy's house.
<p></p>And I'm not saying it's bad,  if anything it makes the whole pony-verse that much sweeter,  that it is such a nice place that every-pony there more or less is able to focus on what they love without having to worry about all the little things that plague people turning them jaded and cynical. And yes a side effect of this is the heretofore discussed obliviousness to history,  major current events etc if they don't directly pertain to there major interests.
<p></p>So the Cantorlot elite not knowing about the Elements of Harmony wielders isn't all that un-thinkable,  since we didn't see any of them in the celebration scenes,  so they could have just chalked it up to,  something bad happened but mommy (The Princess) made the bad man go away,  and now everything's fine,  without really caring about the details. Meanwhile the Ponyville pony's do know about it,  but they know the mane 6 don't want any special recognition for it and treat them like normal.

Which we see at the end of Return more or less.
<p></p>And as to Rainbow,  I'd chalk that up to Rainbow encouraging it to go on,  it also shows that ponyvilleians have a very short attention span,  they celebrate the Mane 6 for a week or so off camera then lose interest. Which also plays into my never fully grow up (by human terms) theory.

            @Ginger: No,  I do not. In truth I'm not entirely certain just what it is that bothers me quite so much about it. Perhaps it's the fact that one party is bound to be enjoying it on a very idfferent level than the other,  perhaps it's the fact that at that level of intimacy if one doesn't care about the other they're little more than a toy. It's one thing to care about and sleep with multiple partners,  or even casual sex if you can at least care about making each other happy for that evening,  but having sex simply because you feel you have to just... squicks me. It smacks of prostitution vaguely,  I suppose.
<p></p>And the odd thing is,  I'm not sure for whom it's worse. Is it worse for the mare,  because FP doesn't care about any of them on a personal level,  or is it worse for FP because he has to spread himself around,  and can't really devote himself,  even if he'd like to? And even then,  I get the feeling most mares see him as a status symbol rather than <em>truly</em> liking him. So maybe that's the idea that really bugs me. He's more a conquest than a partner in this situation. The mares don't want to be with him because they love him,  although they may well like him. They want him because he's powerful and well known and has 'good taste'. Being able to get with him would be seen as a personal acheivement,  like being able to impress an art critic - they're winning his approval with their bodies. There's no love,  no caring; they're only doing it to say that they did. It's superficial,  and at the end of the day an experience that ought to be close and intimate because base and crass; a pornographic popularity contest with a poor stallion in the middle of it. Yes,  he gets pleasure from it. But he doesn't get a partner,  and the fact that it happens may well scare potential partners away.
<p></p>I wonder if he was always as polite as he is now? I wonder if maybe he started out shallow like the rest of them,  but so much fame eventually made him jaded and remorseful for leaving behind simplicity for fame,  but by then it was too late to go back.

<p></p>Its best if we all slip on our Doylist hats and remember is supposed to be kept to a minimum (even if we get some anyway),  and the writers are taking advantage of that in their story telling.
