            I think it was mostly seeing Spike as a fully grown dragon. And maybe the Spike*Rarity stuff a little. Maybe.
<p></p>I'm liking this character-centric discussion. Makes me wonder how character based DVD volumes of the series would manage (who do you think would sell the best?).

            It's sarcasm,  I think the ending of that episode erupted a lot of shipping fans into bliss.

            @Psi: Twilight seems to be most popular among the bronies,  but that might not translate over to sales.
<p></p>As for SOME,  it's fairly middle of the road for me.  I have to say that something about the whole "Spike suddenly becomes giant" thing just felt a little bizarre.  I think it's how out of nowhere it was; there was never any indication that he could do that,  and pretty much everypony seems to have completely forgotten that dragons can do that.  Not to mention that it seems to contradict Dragon Quest.  It almost feels like a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">Big Lipped Alligator Moment</a>.
<p></p>That said,  I loved how it shows Twilight's concern for Spike,  and how it handled Spike and Rarity's relationship.

            Seems Spike's episodes are on the debate now. Dragon Quest was just one of those <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage">So Okay It's Average</a> ones to me,  it was fun,  but I saw a lot of it a mile away and as many moan,  they could have done a lot more with it. It had more Twilight and Spike chemistry though,  which was cool (actually Season Two seemed to have a fair good amount of scenes for the two,  even the rather darkly comic Lesson Zero had an extremely heartwarming ending with them).

            @Psi: Seriously,  the character writing is far and away the best aspect of the show.  The main reason I put MMDW on the bottom of the heap is because it handled the characters the worst.

It wasn't bad,  but I felt like there was a ton of unmapped potential in that episode,  and it spent too much time on Spike messing around with the teenage dragons rather than actually exploring Spike's relationship's with the ponies.

            The inconsistancy in Spike's portrayals sometimes raises my eyebrow a little.
<p></p>Look at how Spike acts in It's About Time compared to how he acts in Lesson Zero for example.

            So,  does anyone know of any famous people who like this show? I know their's Seth Green and Weird Al {Sadly,  I don't remember where I found this out},  but is their anyone else? Regardless of whether or not their actually famous or if their just internet famous,  I'm still curious.

            All of the cast are a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">little inconsistant</a> in places,  but I think that helps them be multi faceted. I think Spike would be blander if he was either strictly childish or strictly mature all the time. Twilight is pretty much the same.

            Dragon Quest was the only Spike episode I'm a fan of. SOME was unmemorable and had too much Spike/Rarity.<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> Which is just overdone in an annoying way.

            Yeah,  I wish the show would do an episode about how Spike interacts with the ponies; Dragon Quest shows that he basically views them as family,  but we don't see a whole lot of him actually interacting with them like that.
<p></p>@Marston: Gabe Newell,  the guy who voices Sheppard from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassEffect" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a>,  I'm sure there are others but I can't think of them.
