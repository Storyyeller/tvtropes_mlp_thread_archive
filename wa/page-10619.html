            Honestly,  every possible alternate solution to that episode relies on Flim and Flam not being determined to either get a huge cut of the profits or run Sweet Apple Acres out of business.
<p></p>As for Pinkie,  she's naive enough to simply <em>not know</em> that she was causing a problem,  and everyone was polite enough to not point it out to her. Even RD,  who was clearly angered by the whole thing managed to keep from blowing up in Pinkie's face over it.
<p></p>I really don't see the holes there that everyone else does.

            Pinkie <em>did</em> bug me a little,  but that didn't annoy me nearly as much as the fact that the way the wager was handled ended up making both sides look kinda stupid.  The Apple Family got suckered into the wager way more easily than they should have,  and Flim and Flam only lost because they had a solid grip on the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a>. What bugs me most is that with some minor tweaks it would have worked fine.  All they had to do was 1. have the Apples reluctant to do the challenge but get pressured into it by the townsponies and 2. have Flim and Flam's cider be subpar to start with so they don't have lose a bunch of IQ points to get defeated.
<p></p>Not to mention that it's kinda in Character for Pinkie to be completely oblivious to the problems she's causing; if she would have realized that she probably would have given RD a handout.

            @Bluespade: I get the feeling that Flim and Flam really weren't interested in anything but running the Apple family out so they could have the orchard to themselves. And yes the decision by Granny Smith to engage in the competition was dumb,  but misplaced pride seems to run in the Apple family (especially the mares).

            @Blue Considering how casually the brothers approached running the family out of town,  I doubt that they had any intention of bargaining with them. They held all the cards,  and they knew it. It was that overconfidence that cost them in the end,  though.

            @van Actually,  it's quite common to dive under water with a snorkel,  then surface and blow all of the water out of it. It's not like they were actually <em>breathing</em> underwater.

Could they have been bluffing? Maybe,  but it would be taking a huge risk to call them on that.

            What do you mean she wanted to do the same thing that Pinkie was doing to her?  The fact that she let Fluttershy go in front of her is proof that she didn't.

Not to mention that despite RD's stated intent to do that,  what we actually see her <em>doing</em> is anything but.

            @Perpetual:  Flim and Flam really posed no threat to the Apples.  Even if they did set up their own stand,  the Apple family couldn't meet all the demand anyway,  so it isn't like they would be losing business to them.  Since they would need to get their apples elsewhere,  they would need to either charge more or cut into their profits.  There is no way they could run the Apples out of business without committing to years of competition,  and they don't seem the sort to spend that much time on one farm when they can try somewhere else.  The whole thing was a bluff to goad the Apple family into making a bad decision.
