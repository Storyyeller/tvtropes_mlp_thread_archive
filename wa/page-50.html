            Rainbow Dash's was just as implausible as Rarity's—I'd give them to Applejack and Rarity,  because Rainbow dash has already met the thunderbolts,  and Rarity needs all the publicity she can get,  particularly after the fluttershy debacle.

            I'd go for either Applejack and Rarity,  or Applejack and Rainbow Dash.
<p></p>...Actually,  maybe Applejack and Twilight? I mean,  she did get the tickets in the first place...
<p></p>Either way,  Applejack is going. She's got the best reason,  and the most reasonable one as well.

            I would definitely have given one of the tickets to Applejack. If I were to give the other ticket away,  I don't know who I'd give it to. Maybe Rarity,  so she can see her designs at work,  or Rainbow,  so she'd get to meet her idols.

Put the second ticket somewhere hidden (but accessible) and leave a trail of clues everywhere. Possibly several trails of clues. All unsigned.
<p></p>That's right,  since I can't decide who to invite,  I'll make a game out of it. Wouldn't that be fun?

            Honestly,  I found it kinda funny that Celestia even sent Twilight the ticket. I mean,  I suppose it may have been 'later' as far as chronology goes,  but that close to the start of the series,  what would Twilight even DO at a party? Between Twilight's friends,  I'd say definitely Applejack,  and the second one...kind of a tossup between Rarity and Fluttershy. Fluttershy is just so hard for me to say no too,  and some socializing would have been good for her,  but as unrealistic as Rarity's expectations were,  She'd essentially have been a walking billboard for her business there,  which would be good for her.

            I created know-age just so I could post in this topic.
<p></p>First of all,  love this series.
<p></p>And now to be on-topic.
<p></p>I probably would have given the tickets to both Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy and then planned a party of my own for the rest of the ponies.  Fluttershy is just too innocent to say no to,  especially since she'd want to enjoy the garden and might even run into another pony who also enjoys wildlife like she does.  Rainbow Dash wants to achieve her dream of meeting her heroes,  so she'd get her chance.
<p></p>Meanwhile,  party at home,  with lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of sweets for Pinkie Pie,  invite a couple of those famous fashion ponies so Rarity can show off her designs,  and basically buy a bunch of apple-based foods from Applejack.

            In that episode,  I actually got the impression Celestia <em>wanted</em> Twilight to just suck it up and ask for help,  to teach her that it's <em>okay</em> to make requests like that now and then.  Plus,  she probably wanted to encourage her to go out more,  and the Gala would be a great way to achieve that.
<p></p>Another possibility is that she thought maybe Twilight had also met some lucky colt in Ponyville,  and this was her way of trying to prompt Twilight to ask him out.  When Twilight sent the tickets back with her explanation,  she probably went "Oh... Well,  maybe next year..." and sent the extras so that they could all be happy.
