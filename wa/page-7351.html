            I've tried to headcanon other racial abilities for non-pony races before,  but I couldn't think of anything for Zebras. Zecora hasn't show any unusual powers,  and we don't know much about their culture.
<p></p>I <em>do</em> have headcanon for Donkeys,  though. If you look at Cranky's flashback to the Gala with Matilda,  it's done in a black and white silent film style,  which (to me) implies that it's even older than Granny Smith's flashback in Family Appreciation Day (which simply used faded sepia tones rather than no color at all). Taking into consideration that both Cranky and Matilda were still adults in the flashback,  and were only just starting to show signs of old age in the present,  I'm led to believe that Donkeys are <em>very</em> long lived,  with an average lifespan <em>at least</em> twice as long as the average pony,  possibly longer. Of course,  this is all baseless speculation on my part.

            I'm operating under the assumption that they were historically male(Although much of Equestria does lead to believe it's a matriarchal society; this analogy works just as well either way but it was male to begin with so it's the easiest to identify with).
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">Hurricane and Pansy were in an army similar to the sacred band of Thebes<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">.
<p></p>For the unawares,  the sacred band of Thebes was the elite Thebian fighting force. It was one of the most feared armies of its day,  able to fight off even the legendary spartan warriors despite being only 300 strong. In it's final battles,  the sacred band fought to the last man,  some even choosing to commit suicide rather than be captured. The sacred band of Thebes was comprised of 150 homosexual couples.
<p></p>The idea is that the couples would fight more ferociously to protect their lover,  and never run for fear of looking cowardly to their love. It worked amazingly. It would explain why Pansy and Hurricane operated together in spite of Pansy not being really inclined to move through the ranks,  although it does have a bit of unfortunate implications regarding their relationship itself.
<p></p>Also a couple pages ago I was skimming through and I thought I saw a post that said 'there is no canon,  only terror'. Which is unsettling,  but kind of awesome.

            Or maybe Hurricane was such an incompetent (Fiery trouble causer) commander that the higher ups wouldn't dare give her anyone important under her command. Thus Pansy is the only soldier that she leads.

            Given that she's treated as the leader of <em>all</em> the pegasi I find that unlikely.   If somebody as incompetent as Puddinghead could end up leading the earth ponies,  it's certainly possible.

            @kegi Wow,  that's a cool strategy.
<p></p>Also,  someone pointed out that after they were unfrozen,  Rarity and Twilight (forgot their character's names) <em>snuggled</em> instead of hugging or highfiving.
