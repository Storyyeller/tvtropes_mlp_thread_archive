<p></p>As for MMDW. It was pretty clear that it was just meant to be a superhero parody episode. We were supposed to watch it for the superhero antics and batman references,  not any of the character interaction.

            @Mio Twilight getting a very stern talking to about what she did and why she was wrong to do it,  and her friends saying that they should have put a stop to her behavior rather than ignore it is absolving her of responsibility and enabling her?

            I can kinda understand how that can be annoying,  I hate shows that tend to have designated 'right and wrong' characters,  even if the "nice" one is playing up equally or worse they will never be seen at fault while the "dumb jerkass" type actually seems more redeemable since they learn from their mistakes more and suffer the brunt of them or even make a good point. The show thankfully avoids this for the most part,  but there are times it does perk up (Twilight and RD do near the two roles at times).
<p></p>@Lurker: To be fair,  she didn't really get a stern talking too,  it was only teased,  admitedly having Celestia lecture her a bit before Twilght broke down about being 'tardy' to her may have worked better.

<p></p>That makes five of us. Belive me,  I can get very defensive of things I like,  except I bet that unlike you guys,  I can't usually come up with good arguements to defend things I like.-_- I just plain suck at these kind of things.

            @Lurker: I'm going to be honest the thing that got me most (and not in a good way) in the episode was when Twilight was giving her apology to Celestia. Now I know that they have been there for a while and other things may have been brought up,  but the apology she gives is not about the "Want it Need it" incident that was solely her fault,  <em>but about the letter and her performance as a student</em>. I'm sorry but if in the face of what has happened that is the thing she feels most sorry about then she has some messed up priorities,  and really should have been called out on it. The fact that no one did,  in fact that other people defended her and took the blame for <em>her actions</em> to me is the very definition of absolving and enabling.

            The train itself,  or the DVD and all episodes therein?
<p></p>Cause for the train itself... The train ponies were boss and Promontory was kinda hot,  so they should come back again?

            it was just the overall FEEL of the episode was off whenever there was anypony other then just the Mane 6 and Iron Will in the scene. Plus uber-dick Angel
<p></p>it's not a bad episode,  and The Mane 6 / Iron Will stuff is epic...plus it was my favorite little <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout Out</a> / Homage bit in the whole series.

            @Moe I don't know where you got continuity out of this. We're discussing the validity of Aesops,  as well as Merriweather Williams's writing post MMDW.

            I admit PYHD seemed a bit meaner toned than most other stories,  even darker ones like Lesson Zero. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">Comedic Sociopathy</a> seemed more present to point out what a doormat Fluttershy was.
