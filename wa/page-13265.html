            Just Google "Pathfinder SRD".  All the info you really need to create a character is free online.

<p></p>I think all the core Pathfinder stuff is available freely online. Check out <a class="urllink" href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/">http://www.d20pfsrd.com/<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

            Ah cool,  thanks! I shall do this thing.
<p></p>I made the mistake of choosing one of the more complex classes(Wizard),  and choosing to play it in a weird way(Took a metamagic feat that removes Somatic requirements from spells so I can cast while wearing armour),  so research is going to be... necessary.

            Also,  Feeling Pinkie Keen is when Twilight thinks that Pinkie has gotten some new ability that shouldn't realyl be possible and keeps tryign to figure out how she did it. Meanwhile the DM and Pinkie decide to start screwing with her.
<p></p>P.S. I can just picture Twilight's reaction to Fluttershy's build. Your animal companion is a BUNNY? What part of Fleshraker do you not understand? And why on earth would you take Alertness? You know most of the PHB feats are complete garbage. At least get Greenbound Summoning or something.
<p></p>^ If you want to see complex,  look at Artificer. Anyway,  sounds like what you want to play is known as a gish. You can do it with Wizard,  but it's easier with one of the specifically designed gish classes like Duskblade. At least it is in 3.5,  I don't know much about Pathfinder.

<p></p>And wizard is fairly easy,  you want complex yet FUN,  try Magus. Get the best parts of both wizards and fighters.

            I'm still continually working on a base class for 4th Edition.
<p></p>Yes,  I know that that is <em>insane</em>,  but I'm getting there. It's based on the Tarot deck. So,  the first-level At-Will powers are the Aces of each suit,  the first-level Encounter powers are the Twos of each suit,  the firs-level Dailies are the Threes of each suit,  and so on.

<p></p>Well I'm not familiar with Pathfinder,  but here's the 3.5 perspective.
<p></p>Being a support Wizard is actually a great idea. Wizards can do anything. They can be a better fighter than the Fighter if they want to. But that isn't very fun. By being a support wizard,  you can use your power to breeze through encounters while making it look like your teammates did all the work,  and everyone gets to have fun.
<p></p>However,  going gish is not the way to do it. The Wizard's best option is generally Battlefield Control,  particularly with spells such as Grease,  Glitterdust,  Web,  or Solid Fog. With a single spell you can dictate the terms of the battle. Blind everyone or trap half your enemies. Make them all fatigued so they can't charge,  or sickened so they're easier for your Fighter to hit,  etc.
<p></p>Also,  if you want to be a frontline fighter,  the best way to do is is to just polymorph into something nasty like a Hydra. Of course,  this doesn't come on line until level 7,  but gishing as a Wizard is hard at low levels,  and you aren't likely to contribute much that way anyway.
<p></p>Also,  a lack of combat does nothing to hurt a Wizard. One of the defining traits of the Wizard and other tier 1 casters is that they have an answer for every occasion. A Fighter gets one,  maybe two tricks,  and they're stuck with them for good. A Wizard gets a dozen tricks and they can change them every day. All Social campagin? Charm Person,  Silent Image,  Detect Thoughts,  etc.

            That's why I love magus
<p></p>You get most of the better Wizard spells,  though only up to level 6 ones. Plus a ton of great melee skills. being able to turn any weapon you pick up into a +5 enchanted weapon at any time,  or take an already +1-5 weapon,  and stack nearly any encahnt you want on top of that,  fiery,  frost,  Vorpal etc...
<p></p>Plus the ability to attack and cast a spell in the same turn.

            And that is why spells should be permanently learned in a manner similar to feats. Anything else is just silly,  really. What's the point of committing to a class if you're free to pick the class that doesn't require any real committal? The only counter is the DM actively metagaming against the Wizard and throwing threats at them to specifically counter the spells they chose that day.

            That's how the Sorcerer works,  sort of - you can cast the spells you know more times than the Wizard,  under certain circumstances,  but you know a lot fewer.
<p></p>Also,  Grease is an amazing spell.  We used it a <em>lot</em>,  and it tended to utterly humiliate whatever was fighting us.

            if we're talking about everything but pony,  then lets get back to pony with a SURPRISE FANFIC REPORT!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Dear Thread Manor...
<p></p>We've got a good variety of fics today,  with romance,  feels,  comedy and action! Lets go form romance to comedy to feels!
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/78579/fancy-mathematics">Fancy Mathematics<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>- in progress. AJ wasn't just joking when when she mentioned Big Macs "fancy mathematics". The stallion is actually a mathematical genius. Only two ponies know about this outside the Apple family however; Pinkie Pie(where do you think she got the gyro copter from?) and Cheerilee(from when they were dating for a time). But there's one other mare in town Big Mac wants to impress with his abilities,  one mare who could understand mathematics as well as he could. That mare is none other than Twilight Sparkle.
<p></p>yep,  it's some TwiMac.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/52346/a-pony-walks-into-a-bar">A Pony Walks Into a Bar<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>- in progress. Listen to the story of a Ponyville bartender and the craziest week he's ever had. A week when,  each day,  one of the elements of harmony stopped by and ended up unloading their troubles and woes on him...
<p></p>this is some good comedy/slice of life,  but more than anything else,  the writing quality is superb.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/26238/a-zoologist-dream">A Zoologist Dream<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>- in progress. Chris,  an aspiring zoologist,  and Keon,  his frat boy best friend,  are on a school trip in Brazil,  going into the Amazon for some hands on zoological experience. Chris finds himself distracted by a strange bird that seems as if from myth and begins following it,  and Keon,  chases after him. The bird leads them to a strange temple,  hidden underground,  with murals of what appear to be horses or maybe ponies. They're both gonna get a lot more hands on experience with all sorts of critters than either could have ever imagined...
<p></p>a human in equestria story that takes a different route than most. This one is full on comedy so far,  though it looks like it might turn serious later. I mean,  Pinkie Pie and marijuana? Awesome!
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/6859/memory-pending">Memory Pending<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. A stallion wakes up in a small crater in the Everfree Forest. He can't remember who he is,  where he's from,  or how he got here. He has only vague recollections of these things. The only things that he's sure about,  is that he definitely wasn't a quadruped,  he was fighting in some kind of war,  and wherever this place is,  it's lot nicer then where he came from. Hopefully,  he can make do around here and maybe find a way to regain his memories. Hopefully,  whatever was happening back where he came from won't follow him to this nice,  peaceful land...
<p></p>This one starts off full on comedy,  then turns real serious a little past the halfway point. also,  massive shipteasing between the OC and both Twilight and Fluttershy. it should be noted that while the original ending closes the story nicely,  the author also added a alternate ending that leads into a sequel.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/25125/the-keepers-of-discord">The Keepers of Discord<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Celestia,  suspecting that Discord is actually aware while a statue,  decides to assign a caretaker to him,  a Keeper of Discord,  so that Discord will have some company. Personally,  Discord wishes they would just leave him alone. He certainly doesn't feel for his keepers,  nor will he begin to,  and he definitely won't begin feeling the pains of being an immortal among mortals...
<p></p>This story actually gave me a feels. Let me assure you,  this is an impressive feat. Highly recommend this one.
<p></p>That's all for today. Keepers of Discord was my favorite out of this batch,  with A Zoologist Dream close behind,  I think. Hope you found something of interest. Until next time!

            Technically the discussion started with regards to MLP as a D&D campaign. It just kind of progressed from there.
<p></p>Speaking of which,  I wonder if there's any popular MLP homebrew for it yet. The 3.5 system is so diverse that it wouldn't be hard to fit in,  or even that far out of place. You can already play as a cat in the official game.

            @Story: So you're saying I might want to rethink the metamagic feat/armour class thing if I do want to play support? That's fair enough,  and I'd honestly been considering that - applying a metamagic to any spell in Pathfinder bumps it up to the next level spellslot,  which would mean top-level spells are out of my reach and I can take less spells in general. I was trying to be a bit thematic - I chose Dwarf as my race because Fuck Elves,  so it made sense they'd be a bit gruffer. And to be perfectly frank the reason I went with wizard is because my other choice,  Paladin,  would have been kind of redundant since we had both a fighter and a healer.
<p></p>Well,  still,  I've got until this sunday to tweak what I want to do with it. Thanks for the advice,  though! As for alternate classes we're using a basic rulebook,  so we've only got the default classes,  ie. Barbarian,  Rogue,  Wziard,  Fighter,  Socrceror,  Cleric,  Baladin and Bard. I think Druid as well but I dunno. So yeah,  nothing too exoti going on here.

            Hey I just had another idea. Derpy is a throwaway NPC that the DM originally didn't even bother to name. But the players became convinced that she was a vital plot hook or something as players are wont to do,  and she eventually grew to be an important reccuring character in the story. The DM didn't have a backstory prepared so she usually just takes whatever the players guess and turns it into canon.

            Just use the wiki,  it has all the ofcial stuff for free. including the expanded classes. And from what you seem to be going for,  yeah you'd really do better with a Magus. They start with no chance of spell failure while wearing light armor,  and as they gain level it goes up to being able to wear medium and heavy armor.

<p></p>At least in 3.5,  Metamagic is mostly used for blasting. If you want to Avada Kedavra people,  metamagic is how you do that. Nothing says die like a Twinned Maximized Empowered Orb of Force,  but unless you specifically build for it,  you can't really do stuff like that. For a support role,  metamagic isn't very useful. You can slap Fell Drain onto a Kelgore's Grave Mist or something for extra debuffs,  or go Fell Drain Hail of Stone for a garuenteed debuff that bypasses nearly all defences,  but overall it doesn't really help much.
<p></p>Also,  if you want more specific build advice,  I'd recommend going to the Giant in the Playground Forums. The people there are a lot more knowledgeable. And have actually played Pathfinder.
<p></p>P.S. In 3.5,  Dwarf is a solid choice,  but Human is usually better. I think Pathfinder changed up the races a lot though so things may differ.
