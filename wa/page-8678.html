            I personally find rarity fascinating because she subverts many tropes that should normally make her a bitchy antagonistic character. And she is the one that gets the best conflicts.

            Eh,  I'd contest that CD. There's still enough genuine good in her that she'd never be a real villain.
<p></p>I mean she can be vain,  certainly,  and a tad selfish. But she's at least <em>trying</em> and that counts for a lot in my books.

            @Ginger:  Okay,  but that doesn't necessarily relate to liking her episodes.  Rarity is my least favorite of the mane six,  but I think all of her episodes are great.
<p></p>Also,  no one is pressuring you to liking Rarity.  Stop being so paranoid.  We're too busy trying to sneak Pinkie into your life to bother with Rarity.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            @Lurker: Fine. Just know that I'm not trying to make anyone change their views on the episode,  and I'm not here to start a flame war. Also,  I really suck at arguements,  so you'll probably own me at this anyway. I don't even know why I'm talking about this.-_-
<p></p>Here's my overall problem with that episode. Did any of you notice that Everyone enjoyed the articles untill THEY were the ones featured in them {Except for Twilight and maybe Fluttershy. Kinda hard to tell since the latter of the two didn't even talk in that episode}? Yeah,  there is totally no hypocrisy at all. Did they get called out on this? No,  they didn't,  because that would have actually been intreasting. So yeah,  let's give the CMC's the cold shoulder when it was your own damn fault that this happend in the first place. How so? Because the whole town loved the articles so much that "Gabby Gums" became very popular,  and it was pretty ovbious that they all wanted more Gabby Gums stories {Again,  except for Twilight and possibly Fluttershy}.
<p></p>I give up. You know what? Go ahead and verbally kick my ass.I can't even back up my arguements right,  so I probably deserve the humilulation anyway. This is going to be so much fun......

<p></p>@ Kegisak: That's just it though. In anything else,  a character with Rarity's interests and basic personality would never be written with any of those good qualities.

            @apple no,  I mean,  you're all unintentionally doing it. No one's being nasty and it isn't any of your faults. It's just that the sheer number of intelligent people whom I respect going on about how Rairty is the greatest thing to writing since sliced bread,  using all of these wonderfully structured arguments and such,  creates this kind of weird <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a> for me.

            Yeah they never got called out on it,  does everyone always get called out? No,  but it was made damn clear that was what was happening,  again,  subtlety. they didn't need to drag it out into the spotlight to make clear it was there and it was wrong.
<p></p>Stop looking at it as a show,  and look at it as video of the real lives,  cuase that's what the writers try and make it,  and people don't always get called out on things IRL.

            I don't think I could do very well at choosing an order for my favorite episodes,  aside from the first place one,  but I'll try:
<p></p><ul><li>1. Sisterhooves Social
</li></ul><p></p>Next is 2-5 in no particular order:
<ul><li>The Best Night Ever
</li><li>Suited for Success
</li><li>Baby Cakes
</li><li>Applebuck Season
</li></ul><p></p>Honorable mention goes to A Dog And Pony Show,  the Canterlot Wedding 2-parter and the Discord 2-parter,  Hearts and Hooves Day,  and The Cutie Mark Chronicles.  (not necessarily in that order as well)
<p></p>The one I think is the most overrated is Sweet And Elite,  although I don't hate it quite as much as I did when I first watched it.  It's still probably my least favorite episode of all,  though,  and definitely my least favorite Rarity episode (for reasons I've ranted about before).
