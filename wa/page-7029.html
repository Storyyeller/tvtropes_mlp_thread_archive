            <span class="blue">@Perpetual Lurker:All the other characters have hobbies,  but Rainbow Dash's hobby is training.  And she's apparently good enough at her job that it takes only a negligible amount of time and effort to get it done everyday,  so she pretty much has nothing BUT free time.  Since she can't train ALL THE TIME (that would probably kill her) she's left with pretty much nothing else to do.  Probably a good thing she's gotten into reading.  Actually,  she kind of reminds me of my brother that way.  He doesn't really have any hobbies,  so when he gets off work sometimes he just sort of sits around staring at the wall or goes to sleep.</span>

            Hello Pipping
<p></p>And I think that RD probably has a really weird sleeping schedule. I've sort of made it my head canon that she sleeps in naps versus just one long period. My roommate sleeps like that: 3:00-8:00 a.m. and a mid-day 3 hour nap or so. I mean,  weather duty doesn't die at 10 p.m. when it's time to go to sleep. Maybe she even has a night shift or takes the night shift every once in a while.

            @Blue I know,  I wasn't disagreeing with you. I said was that she <em>looks</em> lazy. It's all about perception,  and it's very easy to perceive her that way without context. I also think that she'll take shortcuts in her work if given the chance,  not because it's less work,  but because it's faster,  and she loves to get things done fast.

            Yeah,  I think that Pegasi just have a lot of free time. I mean,  from what we've seen,  changing the weather is actually not that hard. So I would guess they have a lot of free time in general if they work with weather. But then again,  real life meteorologists spend all day calculating weather patterns and stuff like that,  so maybe RD does that? She's secretly... a math nerd! D:
<p></p>But I see the changing weather to be about as hard to Pegasi as,  say,  ummm.... hmmm... give me a minute,  I need a metaphor. But the action of changing the weather doesn't seem to be particularly hard for Pegasi is all I'm saying.

            I don't think he really would have take all her bits (well he would have but he wasn't REALLY trying to) he was just trying to haggle for a better price form a position of strength,  expecting Fluttershy to start the battering process,  which she did...in the opposite direction.
<p></p>RD IS lazy-ish,  she is perfectly eager to do anything she finds entertainging or fun,  but has no patience for anything that bores her and would rather just nap.
<p></p>@ Ginger,  she can't do her ENTIRE job in seconds,  the Ten-seconds-flat...look at just how few clouds there were,  all she was doing was breaking up a few scattered wisp of clouds,  I'm sure there is a LOT more to her job that requires much more effort,  plus we've seen that some of the larger events require a team of Pegasi and RD is the one tht has to get them organized,  prepped,  all that stuff.
<p></p>Aj also practices for the next rodeo when she's not working,  or just finds something else that needs doing,  for her her work isn't just a job to her,  it's her entire livelihood and home.

            My theory on the weather team is that most of their job is 'scouting',  with various other duties and levels of intensity based on altitude. The high-altitude team is long-range scouting,  they look at the clouds and the wind currents in the high altitudes and use it to predict what weather patterns are forming naturally. That helps the mid and low altitude teams to get prepared. The mid-altitude team(Where Dash works) ensures that the weather patterns are along the scheduled routes - so while it looks like they've got a lot of free time,  they do have to be on call pretty much all the time in case the weather starts to stray from the course. The low-altitude team ensures that things on the ground are prepped for the oncoming weather,  and will serve as messengers to let the other teams know if things are going wonky.
