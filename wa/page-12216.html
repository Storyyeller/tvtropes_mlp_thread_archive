            I thought of something about a past controversial episode,  namely,  "The Last Round-Up."  I was wondering if the whole censorship and fighting problems could have been avoided had Derpy simply been called Ditzy Doo in the episode like the writer was originally going to do.  "Ditzy Doo" would be less likely to be seen as a potentially ableist slur,  and while it's not the most common fan-used name for the gray pegasus with googly eyes,  it's probably the second-most common fan-name used for her in works,  so it could still be seen as a nod to the fans that way.  Or would that still have caused a lot of problems because of fans who might be upset that the writers were too afraid to be controversial to use the name Derpy or simply because those particular fans got attached to calling her Derpy and didn't want the show canon to change their version of things.  I also understand that her voice was part of the controversy,  but even if the voice had been the same as it was in the original version,  would using the name "Ditzy" make people think she's an insult to mentally disabled people?

            They'd still probably have complained about it. The main issue was less the content of the changes themselves,  and more that people were mad at the show for seemingly caving to criticism.

            And they can still think. Just back wherever they came from. They didn't just vanish. The show made a point of showing them go back to the pond,  precisely so we <em>wouldn't</em> think she killed them.

            @JT: I didn't mean changing her name to Ditzy Doo after the episode was aired with Rainbow Dash calling her Derpy,  I meant more if she had been called Ditzy Doo in the first place instead of Derpy.  Not "what if they changed her name instead of taking it out" but "what if she had been called Ditzy Doo from the start?"

            People would still be mad that they called her something other than Derpy. Personally,  I think they should have left her nameless if they can't use Derpy.

            The funny part is that in the fanon Derpy is the one with the most healthy relationships of all the ponies. Especially when shipped with the Doctor,  doubly so if he's not actually a time traveler but just a regular pony.

            None of that is canon,  so I'm not quite sure how it factors into the debate here. (Not to mention all that canon evidence against the whole Derpy/Dinky thing that people seem to be in denial about. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">)

            Sisterhooves Social shows that Dinky is Sparkler's sister. I've heard people try to explain that away,  but the way they explain it makes me want to slit their throats with Occam's Razor.

            In that same scene,  Twilight also looks at a random male background pony in that same scene. Does that mean she's dating him off camera?
<p></p>Background pony relationships are fickle and don't have much continuity since they're just used as incidental characters. Amethyst Star is Dinky's older sister in "Sisterhooves Social"... and then Amethyst Star has an entire speaking scene in "Mysterious Mare-do-Well" where she's having a picnic with another filly Tootsie Flute. Another funny thing with Amethyst is that,  unlike Dinky,  she actually <em>has</em> been spotted standing next to Derpy a few times.
<p></p>The truth is that outside of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomNod" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomNod">Fandom Nods</a> background ponies are just randomly used when incidental characters are needed. This is why Bon Bon's voice never stays the same. They just randomly pick a background pony to say that line and it just happens that Bon Bon has gotten picked 5 or 6 times.
<p></p>Anyways,  speaking of background ponies,  we may have some <a class="urllink" href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/11/new-blindbag-set-pops-up-on-ebay.html">new toy names!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> That is,  if the bag was easier to read,  but from what I can see we have...
<p></p><ul><li> Lily Valley. The last flower pony gets a toy,  and a surname!
</li><li> Lucky Clover. Say,  weren't those separate <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nicknames</a> for the same guy?
</li><li> Sweetie Drops? The Bon Bon looking one. This looks like one of those cases where the toyline doesn't <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationNameChange" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationNameChange">follow something else already established</a>,  namely the Gameloft game where Bon Bon's name is <em>spoken aloud</em> by Spike and Twilight,  official voices and all.
</li><li> We're getting a name for that third Wonderbolt judge in "Sonic Rainboom". The light reflection covers it up,  but someone on EQD thinks it says "Misty Fly",  which would make that a partial <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon">Ascended Fan Nickname</a>.
</li></ul><p></p>On that note,  I leave you with <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent">Something Completely Different</a>.

            In my headcanon Written Script is Dinky,  Amethyst Star  and Tootsie Flute brother and coltfriend of Carrot Top. That's explain that TLR scene.
<p></p>And about Derpy/Ditzy.  Ditzy Doo is canon name for offscreen pony with only suggestion that could be real Derpy name. Same reason why Ditzy was renamed in TLR is same reason why it was grey blond pegasus not just other background one (like Raindrops). (So Cereal dont remember pony dressed as Ninja in Luna Eclipsed?)
<p></p>Also  that another stalion mentioned here <a class="urllink" href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/11/too-many-pinkies-episode-followup.html">http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/11/too-many-pinkies-episode-followup.html<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is my headcanon brother of Carrot and Noimi (I hope I remember name of that filly).
