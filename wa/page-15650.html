            Old news. Though look at the rather horrid Photoshop in that. The original background they had for that picture,  someone made a MAJOR screw up. they actually used the background from Twi's Fighting is Magic stage. You know that really really highly anticiapted game hadbro screwed us out of.. yeh that did not go over well
<p></p>You can see where some of the stacks of books were on the table in the original,  no they are floating in the air.

Going into a professional arena against AAA published games was a terrible,  terrible idea. Like project suicide terrible. And for all their arrogance,  they still got bailed out in the end.

            @CDRW: That sucks.  Hopefully another opportunity will come up soon.
<p></p>@<a class="urllink" href="../wa/page-15649.html#post-391202">Kegisak from 2 pages ago<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>: Sometimes I swear that the main reason certain social movements aren't moving faster is specifically <em>because</em> some members treat everyone who's not actively involved in crusading for their pet issue like they're actively against it.  They've probably alienated lots of people who are neutral on the issues by treating them like enemies.
<p></p>@Kuroi: I wouldn't say <em>arrogance</em> so much as "got caught up in the rush".  They only started advertising because people saw how good the product was and wanted to publicize it more.  But yeah,  taking it to conventions and whatnot was a bad idea.

            <div class="quoteblock">You mean the highly anticipated game that the devs screwed themselves and everyone else out of? Going into a professional arena against AAA published games was a terrible,  terrible idea. Like project suicide terrible. And for all their arrogance,  they still got bailed out in the end.</div>
<p></p>I think you're being way to harsh on them. Getting your game in the open is important for maintaining motivation to work on the project,  as well as getting outside feedback.

            Story: I realize this,  but there's a really fine line when using someone else's intellectual property. I mean,  they were getting plenty of attention and feedback without getting C&Ded without jumping into a professional fighting game arena.
<p></p>EDIT: Really? If I was in their position,  I certainly wouldn't have done it. If someone had contacted me about getting into a professional arena,  that would be a <strong>giant</strong> red flag,  not an "oh,  sweet,  let's do it!" moment. The moment I saw them announced for EVO,  I knew they were done.
<p></p>Seraph: They may not have actively looked for it,  but they went along with it. They could just as easily have turned down EVO. If think if they had continued as they were without agreeing to it,  things wouldn't have blown up in their face.

            Anyway,  I think game development is particularly tough to stay motivated with since it's hard to get enojyment from playing your own game (obviously this depends somewhat on the genre,  with story or puzzle based games having it the worst). That means that if noone else is playing your game,  it feels like there's no point in continuing.
<p></p>Incidently,  I guess this is a good time to plug Pickory and MLP Portal Advance.

            I do agree they got to big,  and that the bigger issue wasn't Hasbro but the shear idiocy of US trademark laws. but still bullshit to lose out on something so epic.
<p></p>Again THEY didn't jump into it,  they were drawn in by the EVO guys and the hype around the game.
