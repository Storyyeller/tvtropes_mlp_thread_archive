But a pony Corinthian would be very different to the human one. He is a nightmare made of everything humanity will not confront about itself,  and he turned into the pettiest version of that,  a mere serial killer who thinks that his killing makes him special and unique. And yes,  the Sandman features a convention of serial killers,  somewhere in rural USA. It's like a very twisted mirror to our own comic-cons. It is frightening and pitiful at the same time. Now I'm not sure what the Corinthian would turn out like in Equestria. Someone petty and mean and cruel? Something like Johan the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Monster" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Monster">Monster</a>,  but without the lethality,  who would talk ponies into breaking down and never picking themselves up again?

            Something about the latest episode keeps bothering me but I keep forgetting to mention it:
<p></p>When Rarity comes to after the "surprise,  its Twilight!" moment,  why is Pinkie repeating her dialogue from the opening of "Griffon the Brush-Off?"  Is Rarity just hallucinating or is Pinkie actually saying that?

Someone like that FS would be ostracized and shunned in no time. You need someone who can fit in,  who can get close to you with your defenses low,  hurt you or make you hurt yourself,  and come out of it smelling of roses,  so that not even the victims know what he did or his intent,  ready to strike again.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">The mane cast was acting fairly strange. More uncouth than usual if you ask me. I don't remeber AJ doing any gardening at the Gala. It's like Machiavelli's Prince,  twisting and slightly misrepresenting the characters' actions for the sake of argument,  telling a story differently for the sake of an Aesop. Something there has been too much of in this season,  as of now. The first season served to define characters and fill in the blanks left by the opening. This should constrain this season to only work on the blanks that are left,  or build upon what was drawn,  not twist and bleach it for the sake of one-off jokes and lessons.
<p></p>Twilight dancing horribly was very heartwarming though. She's really outgrown herself.

            I wouldn't say the Corinthian fits in.  Doesn't he scare everyone he comes across (with the possible exception of the sort of serial killer who attends a serial killing convention)?

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">The Corinthian was meant to be Morpheus' masterpiece: "A nightmare created to be the darkness,  and the fear of darkness in every human heart. A black mirror,  made to reflect everything about itself that humanity will not confront." Instead,  Dream finds his creation has walked the earth for about forty years,  playing the role of a serial killer who removes his victims' eyes. Dream had created the Corinthian as a nightmare that would show humanity its own dark nature. Dream judged him a failure,  however,  because in forty years' time,  the Corinthian did nothing other than commit gruesome murders,  which fell far short of Dream's original,  much grander intent. As punishment,  Dream "uncreates" him,  leaving a skull and some sand. He then remarks that the next time he creates the Corinthian,  he "shall not be so flawed and petty."

<p></p>We still have  about half a season before calling the whole season OOC. I don't disagree that the mane cast are a bit off,  and it's especially jarring because this episode's writer is someone who has written several S1 episodes,  unlike last episode's writer.
