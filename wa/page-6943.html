            @Drenius: What Ginger said. Also,  when I mention risk,  I mean this - each contestant is basically thrown into the challenge they pick without any instructions and with a time limit of 2-3 minutes. The idea is that they have to figure out what to do and do it quick,  get the crystal,  and get out of that room. If they run out of time before getting out,  they're stuck there for the rest of the episode and can't participate in any further challenges - including the final challenge.

            I see either Pinkie or Twilight as kind of chubby. Twilight because I imagine she spends a lot of time inside just eating while she studies. Pinkie... because... well,  she has a HUGE appetite.

            So I figured out what you need to do for this.
<p></p>Log into Google plus,  drag people into a hangout then click Chat.  Go to Apps and click youtube,  find episode,  and watch.  Everyone should see the same thing and be able to discuss it on sidebar chat.

            I wouldn't say ATLA has any major wham episodes,  apart from possibly the season 2 finale. It's more like they're just Major Plot Developments as opposed to relatively uneventful episodes.

            Also,  I dn't see Twi as very chubby,  sure she studies a lot,  but she's the type of pony that would create a perfect,  book approved work-out regimen and stick to it. Also i'm betting she quite often gets so caught up in studying she even forgets to eat.
