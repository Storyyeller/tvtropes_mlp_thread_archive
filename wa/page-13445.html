            And also because they have the personality for it. I think a normal civic minded person would go to the government,  or scientists,  or start a company or something. Some superheroes do,  and there are reasons for why many don't,  but it's still weird.

            What if the superhero is also a scientist and subjects him/herself to scientific analysis because he/she wants to study these new abilities in a scientific manner?
<p></p>Kind of like Twilight studying magic in an academic manner,  actually.  That brings to mind an idea of Twilight hooking herself to that machine she put Pinkie in when she was studying the Pinkie Sense.  Then she sees how the machine responds and what it reads out when she does various feats of magic,  ranging from minor telekinesis to complex spells.

<p></p>As for scientists,  we <em>do</em> study ethics. Admittedly,  some wouldn't put them into practice,  but that <em>would</em> get you looked down upon and likely get you in trouble with the law.

            I enjoyed OBA,  myself. Generally I can at least see where people are coming from when they dislike this or that episode,  but I'll admit in this case I'm a bit lost unless I assume the like/dislike divide is spread among the people who have legitimate issues with how they were treated by bullies in their youth. And I don't just mean people who were bullied - I was myself - but rather people who are more bitter about it than I.
<p></p>Unfair and probably inaccurate,  I realize,  but I don't really see anything wrong with the episode itself.

            The reason why I hated OBA is how unsubtle and predictable the delievery of aesops and dialogues,  respectively,  were. That is obviously a case of YMMV. As for bullies,  eh,  they were never really a part of my childhood.

            @Morning: While it makes a point,  at least about the blank flank thing(Though to be honest I'm certain that DT and SS's motivations stem from a <em>personal</em> dislike of the three rather than their blank flank status),  but I think the conclusions are pretty unfair. Babs was still very much treated as being in the wrong: the reason the CMC were seen as the bad guys is because they were doing EXACTLY the same thing as she did. The point of the episode was basically that hurting others to feel good,  regardless of motivation,  is always wrong. Bear in mind,  nobody is <em>really</em> punished here. The CMC don't really take any blows - at worst they wind up in the mud,  which while it was supposed to humiliate Babs,  doesn't really move towards humiliating them. In the end the only people punished are DT and SS.

            Well,  it's a YMMV thing,  so I don't think so. IT's subjective by nature which means it can't really be right or wrong,  not unless its WAY off base. People can certainly FEEL Babs should have been punished more.
<p></p>That sort of post,  though,  is in my defense WHY I tend to assume those who dislike the episode are bitter. I've heard fro ma rather focal component that seem to demand Babs be punished more,  whereas otherwise when someone says they dislike the episode they tend to forgo explanation.
