            NMM never got away with anything with just an apology. It was Luna that repented once NMM was vanquished. And Discord,  hell only reason he was given so much of a chance to repent was becuase of how useful his powers would be,  and just how big a threat he was if they didn't convert him.
<p></p>And yeah IF she repented,  but we saw ZERO hints that she was anything other then a straight up sociopath. To just go from that to sudenly "<a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OPh" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OPh">O Ph</a> yeah I was an ass,  my bad learned my lesson." Yeah couldn't buy that for a second,  she wouldn't have been sorry she screwed up,  she would have simply been sorry she got in trouble and would be saying what she had to to get herself what she wanted.
<p></p>Without actually seeing her learn,  and have some way to know she wasn't just faking it like any smart sociopath will do in that situation,  yeah doesn't work for me.

That,  and admitting wrongdoing is obviously very important. Princess Luna apologized and Discord promised to behave,  so both of them were forgiven. But comparatively minor villains like Gilda or the Flim Flam Brothers received no forgiveness because they never asked for it.
<p></p>In the episode as it was broadcast,  Lightning Dust didn't repent in the slightest. However,  we don't see enough of her after getting her badge torn off to rule out the possibility that Spitfire's reprimand finally got through to her.
<p></p>And the deleted scene shows that Spitfire's reprimand really did get through to her.

            @Meta: Well,  yeah,  an apology is expected. I was just saying that NMM and Discord were both offered redemption before it was clear that they would take it.  Giving LD a second chance wouldn't surprise me at all. My headcanon is that she got busted down a rank and had to earn her way back up.

            And as I stated,  LD came off as a straight up sociopath. And to make that big a turn,  that quick,  with no lead up or anything,  just sociopath one minute,  apologetic pony who "learned her lesson" the next. And only after her actions result in consequences for her. Yeah,  it just scream of her faking it,  like any sociopath will do. Not her actually learning anything.

            And again NMM was never given a chance,  Luna was once NMM was defeated. And we don't know how much of her was NMM. And Discord,  Celestia outright said she was giving him the second chance just because of how useful he would be on their side. Plus the whole,  not wanting to risk him escaping again at some point after the mane 6 are gone and new bearers for the EOH hadn't been found yet. That was less altruism,  and more cold hard logic and chess playing. the only pony that legit wanted to give him another chance just for the sake of giving him a chance was Fluttershy.
<p></p>If she wasn't a sociopath,  then she should have shown some reaction when Dash called her out beside "Who the buck cares about ponies who aren't me?" not ONLY have the change of heart after her behavior bites her in the ass.
