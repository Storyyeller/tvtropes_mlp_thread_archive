            @Cookoo: Glad that you're enjoying it. Try The Worst Bakers in Equestria while waiting for the next chapter.
<p></p>@Ginger:Eh,  at least <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Red wins the first round</span> and AJ is totally awesome.
<p></p>EDIT: @crowlover:You mean what did she think of the episodes? If so,  I'm preventing Star Swirl from finding out things that she doesn't know in my fanfic already and she has a highly idealised view of the Mane 6.

            Everyone has different tastes,  Ginger. Some people do genuinely find Pinkie funny. You can hardly fault them for that even if you don't understand that,  not when most people would consider your tastes a bit confusing.
<p></p>In non pony-related news(Because I'm excited and want to gush),  I got an email from <a class="urllink" href="http://www.crankshaftgames.com/">a company called Crankshaft Games<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> asking me for an interview(Well,  video conference on skype - same difference,  probably)! Eeeeeeehehehehe,  so excited that I'm actually going to have a possibility when I get out to Montreal! this move is looking brighter and brighter!
<p></p>Now I need to go pack and ship my stuff!
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Pfffff,  that is actually pretty funny. I bet he's pleased about that. "IS that all I am to you!? A walking,  talking penis!?"(sobs)

            @Crow I can't even ENJOY hating Pinkie,  because she's treated as being a good character.
<p></p>It's just so painful to LOVE a fic. Absolutely love it. but then to have HER come along and ruin it EVERY. Single. Time.
<p></p>Every MLP fic I've ever read

            @Story Yes. you probably could. Although since I am not you,  I cannot guarantee that you will enjoy it. However <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FF6" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FF6">FF 6</a> is considered one of the best Final Fantasies of all time and <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PF6" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PF6">PF 6</a> keeps up with that Track Record.

<p></p>I dunno. Imagine she's AJ? Think about AJ while reading the scenes?
<p></p>Anyways,  you're pretty much never alone as you think you are. Oftentimes there's more than one person on this thread who agree with you,  and barring that there's always somebody out there who agrees. Your problem is that you imagine yourself to be alone regardless of your opinion,  tell yourself you're alone,  and then refuse the company of those who would agree with you,  because you think you <em>should</em> be alone. You set yourself up for failure,  as far as that goes. You need to learn to relax,  take things as they come.
<p></p>Don't worry rich,  I got it.
<p></p>I'm just buggering off now because I need to pack up my computer. I'll be back from my laptop in a couple of hours.
