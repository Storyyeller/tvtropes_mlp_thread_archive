            @Terlwyh: A: They complimented those particular aspects becuse <em>they were giving her clues</em>.  (Though I confess that it might have been better for them to compliment other aspects.) And Flutershy wasn't confrontational <em>at all</em> in that episode.
<p></p>People had <em>many</em> problems with A Canterlot Wedding''. Most of which I disagree with. It's my favourite episode as well. Considering the fact that it detroned Hurricane Fluttershy which left me in tears  and I considered an episode made specifically for me and Lesson Zero which I thought was perfection in the form of a television episode,  that's saying a lot.
<p></p>EDIT: The extremely negative reaction to Hurricane Fluttershy involved being upset that it wasn'taliteral hurricane and didn't take up most of the episode.
<p></p>Luna Eclipsed <em>did</em> have problems,  but <strong>PRINCESS LUNA OF THE NIGHT!!!!</strong> overshadowed them. But there were those who disliked Luna. So yeah.

<p></p>Oh I remember that. But it's just one person,  and has nothing to do with the episode itself.

<p></p>What?  People actually thought that the title of episode was meant to be taken literally?  Were they disappointed when Rarity didn't do a vaudeville routine with the Diamond Dogs in "A Dog and Pony Show"?  Did they feel lied to when it turned out that Green really is Fluttershy's Color?  Did it bother them that there weren't any Bridles in "Bridle Gossip"? Did they rage when the Cutie Mark Crusaders didn't Stop their Show?  What about the lack of any barrels in "Over A Barrel"? The absence of tears in "Read it and Weep"?  The fact that "Sleepless in Ponyville" Doesn't actually take place in Ponyville?
<p></p>I can understand differences in taste.  Different people like different things.  But that...it's just...WAT.

            Ya know,  the episodes I didn't like I simply went "Eh,  seen better" and never watched them again. "Dragon Quest" is one of those episodes.
<p></p>Am I weird for not having strong emotions over bad episodes?

<p></p>I've seen that,  yes. Mostly because they wanted to see where Scootaloo lived though,  I think.
<p></p>@dRoy: You still haven't told us what episodes you actually <em>liked</em>.
<p></p>@Calnos: I've liked <em>every</em> episode enough that I've rewatched them all multiple times.

            @Dhana: Dude,  we have a spoiler thread for a reason.  Take the spoilers over there.
<p></p>Also,  yeah,  at <em>worst</em> my reactions tend to be indifferent. My least favorite episode is "Over a Barrel",  and my general attitude towards it is basically "Eh,  it's a thing".  Sometimes I really don't get why people react so strongly over some episodes; I mean,  in some cases I can get it because it connects to real life issues,  but seriously,  guys it's a show about cartoon ponies.  It should not cause a reaction that affects your blood pressure.
<p></p>I mean,  even my least favorite episode is something I'll still probably watch again at some point,  if only to give it a fair chance.
<p></p>Really,  that's my reaction in general to entertainment I don't like,  just avoid it.  I don't understand the mindset that "This is so terrible it's somehow actually hurting me".

            I haven' seen the new episode yet. Unfortunately.
<p></p>But:
<p></p>Think is the the true form of all that is good: 9
<p></p>Love: 13
<p></p>Like a lot: 13
<p></p>Think is pretty good: 10
<p></p>It's still okay: 9
<p></p>EDIT: Quite a few episodes hav connected with issues most imprtant to me. The biggest times it has affected me is Hurricane Fluttershy (though that was a <em>good</em> rection),  Sisterhooves Social which has a tendency to make me feel depressed due to triggery stuff and Over a Barrel which makes me angry as it reminds me of how bleak my future looks as a white South African.

            I like Hurricane Fluttershy but not as much as most of the fandom it seems. I've never had confidence issues so I guess the episode just didn't strike a chord with me.
<p></p>It's good,  but I'm not even sure if it would be in my top ten.

            @Purple Dalek: I was emotionally abused to the point that I believed that I was incapable of anything good and that my existence made the world a worse place. I came very close to commiting suicide out of a sense of duty. As such,  Hurricane Fluttershy was very connected to my issues.
