            One of the DVD manufacturers posted an explanation once,  although I can't find it.  If I remember right it basically boiled down to "it's financially safer to release small themed sets and we won't due a box set unless we know for a fact that we won't lose cash on it".  I know it seems obvious to <em>us</em>,  but it's kinda unprecedented for a show aimed at this age bracket to have such a ridiculously large fanbase,  so I can't blame them for wanting to hedge their bets.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Also this.  The themed dvds can go in the toy section and get bundled and whatnot.  A box set goes in the movie/tv section,  where it's much less likely that a kid is going to see and ask for it.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">Oh wow.  I'm guessing that that's either a fake or a misprint,  because otherwise it would have come up in show.  I mean,  unless they're trying to hide it,  I'd have thought it would have come up during Hearts and Hooves day.
<p></p>EDIT: Okay,  I see now.  Apparently Cheerilee and Scootaloo were related...in a previous generation.  That's not a G4 toy.  Have to admit it's a hilarious idea though.  I can only imagine AB and SB's reactions.

            If Scootaloo had a sister,  she would have been in Sisterhooves Social,  so I think it's safe to rule that possibility out.
<p></p>@Mio I don't see how when they reveal details about a character matters at all. Are you saying that this coming season is too late to reveal any details about the cast's families?

            @Mio Connecting two existing characters like that would make no sense,  yes,  but the way you worded it,  you said that revealing <em>any</em> details about a character is something that you should only do in the first season. If that was the case,  then season two is doing it wrong,  I guess.

            @Perpetual: I think what he means is that there are circumstances in the show in which point you'd expect that sort of reveal to come up.  For example,  I think the reveal that SA was Twilight's brother mostly worked because there were almost no points in the show in which it would have made sense to bring up that information; SA was almost never an active force in the story so there was no reason to introduce him.
<p></p>Cheerilee and Scootaloo,  on the other hand,  interact on a regular enough basis that if they're sisters,  it would almost certainly have been mentioned,  and the fact that it wasn't would be a rather glaring omission.  Case in point,  if they're siblings,  then it should have come up in Sisterhooves Social,  or any point where Scootaloo and Cheerilee interact. H&amp;H is the most obvious; as Apple Bloom mentioned that it was odd to pair Cheerilee up with her brother.  If Scoots is related to Cheerilee,  then it definitely should have been mentioned.
<p></p>Or the idea of Scootaloo having a disability.  She's been around long enough without it ever being mentioned that bringing it up now in the sense of "oh,  didn't we mention that Scootaloo has always had gimp-wing" would just be weird.  On the other hand,  introducing it as a disability could work (e.g. Scoots gets fed up with her inability to fly and sees a doctor about it).
<p></p>TL;DR:
<p></p><ul><li>Revealing new info about a character = fine
<p></p></li><li>Revealing new info about a character that logically should have been mentioned earlier = not fine.

<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">To be honest I don't think giving her a disability would work in the sense that there appears to be nothing wrong with her physically (consider the kind of weight she can pull with her wings on her scooter),  so any sort of disability would need to be rather esoteric (problem with her pony magic) or retcon her previous physical feats.

            Which is why I said that it wouldn't make sense for two already existing characters. I was just pointing out the blanket statement. With the disability,  though,  it wouldn't exactly come out of left field. When characters ranging from infants to other children her age have been shown to be perfectly capable of flight,  and the fact that she isn't able to herself is blackmail worthy,  <em>something</em> is probably wrong.

            I think the only time so far in the show when a character is introduced and then later revealed to be related to another already established character is Sweetie Belle,  and that's only because Rarity wasn't in "Call of the Cutie" and <em>the very next time we see Sweetie Belle</em> she's with Rarity at the beginning of "Stare Master" (a few episodes later) and we learn they're sisters. Every other time we learn about family members that character is being introduced for the first time,  even with Shining Armor or family members of minor characters like Diamond Tiara's dad.

            @Perpetual: On the other hand,  we don't really see a lot of pegasus foals actively flying; the only one we've seen is Rainbow Dash,  and she's not exactly a good indicator.  Neither is Pound Cake for that matter; Pumpkin did a bunch of crap that most unicorns couldn't pull off,  so I wouldn't take them as a good example of what ponies are typically capable of.   It <em>could</em> be a disability,  but it could also just be that Scoots is a late bloomer.
