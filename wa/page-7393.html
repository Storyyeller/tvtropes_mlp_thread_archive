<p></p>Ginger...meh I've already discussed Stable  with you. She could have done far far worse then just <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> seal them in</span> and it does seem like a last minute change instead of the whole point,  she probably saw the list for that Stable,  and decided none of them deserved to be saved.
<p></p>@ Story,  there are a few mods to Fallout 3 that add a few things in like some of the weapons and items.

            Well I guess making the game from scratch is a better bet. But soemthing like Fallout3 would be way too hard,  even if it used copied assets. I wonder how hard something like Fallout 1 would be.
