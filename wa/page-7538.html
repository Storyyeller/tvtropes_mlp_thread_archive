            And btw,  most of the time the angsting IS justified,  I just wish the story wouldn't engineer so many situations where the appropriate response IS to angst.
<p></p>Getting a young filly ripped in half by ghouls? Okay,  the angsting is ok here and serves as important character development for BJ.
<p></p>Pulling the plug on 40 terminally ill and hopelessly insane children locked in stasis? Angsting (at least the amount BJ does) is LESS justified here,  since there was physically no hope for them.

            Yeah,  I've been fine with Blackjack's angst so far. I can understand her angst,  so it doesn't bother me.
<p></p>Just...how could someone think that such a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackHoleSue" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackHoleSue">Black Hole Sue</a> would be a good idea?
<p></p>But I'll keep reading (once I'm finished with a couple of other fics that I'm enjoying).
<p></p>EDIT: I had clinical depression and a deep sense of self-loathing when I was younger,  so I actually identify with such characters.

            Hmm... I'll have to look at that later on. Considering how Wangst and Angst can be misinterpreted. Though,  from what I have heard,  it seems to be quite valid.

<p></p>Okay that's just...no...just no. I have now decided that Goldenblood is a loser who is using mind control to manipulate ponies into thinking that he's awesome. This will be my Headcanon for PH.
<p></p>@Ginger: As I said,  I identify with such angsting due to the fact that I went through a period of time where I truly believed that my pressence actively made the lives of everyone around me suck more.

<p></p>Exactly! It's like,  I can't get my character to look awesome on his own,  so I have to have him steal everypony else's acheivements from the main fic's canon! If I was kkat,  I'd find that <em>really</em> anoying!

<p></p>I think he arranged Big Mac's assassination because Big Mac wanted to resign from the military.
<p></p>Oh,  and I hope this was just a Stable Tec mistake and not a conscious decision by Scootaloo... Stable 90 had NOTHING in it. No food,  no water,  no terminals,  no beds,  no nothing. The Door only even stays in place due to the locks. All the ponies assigned there were dead in 24 days...

<p></p>also as to the Stable,  that's a result of non-Kkat writers not understanding the difference between Stable-Tec and Vault-Tec. vault-tec did fucked up stuff like that just to see what would happen,  Stable-Tec only tried to find what form of government/society would be least likely to engage in another war. For vault Tec the experiments were the ENTIRE point of the Vaults,  for ST,  they were a secondary objective,  to which the main objective of saving ponies ALWAYS took precendence.

            @seraph Hey now,  be fair. Did we know that Big Mac's death WASN'T an assassination? Were we told what happened by anything other than a newspaper? (which we knew were being censored)
<p></p>Project Horizons goes into the more deeper,  scheming inner workings of the ministries. I think the additions are fair. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">

<p></p>Regarding the trailer,  it's ok,  but I think it still needs work. The font looks wrong for one thing.
