            Mio: I find it more surprising that people actually like this episode. Pinkie is horrible to someone for 90% of the episode and absolutely refuses to get the hint that not everyone has to like you. She pesters him and starts messing with his stuff despite him practically begging her to leave it alone,  then invades his house and nearly destroys one precious memento and <em>actually</em> destroys another,  and then in the end she goes and makes friends with him anyway.
<p></p>She learned no lesson,  and the lesson that was claimed was pretty damn contrary to what actually happened.
<p></p>Edit: Oh,  right,  I forgot the toupee scene. Way to destroy his stuff and then publicly humiliate him,  Pinkie.

            Yeah,  I kinda wish that the moral had been "Not everyone is going to gel with you,  and that's okay",  but in a show called "Friendship is Magic" it was pretty much given that that wasn't going to happen.

            @Arha Exactly why I'm meh about the episode. Everything you said,  I agree with,  (especially the home invasion thing) I just don't feel any anger towards it.
<p></p>I just don't care.
<p></p>Why do you think the song is terrible?

<p></p>Personally I spent most of the episode sympathizing with Cranky and I was satisfied that Pinkie had finally gotten called out for her shenanigans,  and would learn her lesson. . .until the scenes after the library happened,  which in my opinion really damaged this episode.

They did not need to go the extra mile.

            @Mio The lesson wasn't "zany = bad" (as much as some people wish it was). It was that you can't force people to want to spend time with you,  and that some people just want left alone.

            I don't even really remember the song now,  so I can't answer that one anymore. My anger over the episode drowned it out.
<p></p>And yeah,  I could have at least accepted this episode if Pinkie had learned the <em>proper</em> moral here.

Still,  she could probably do well to tone it down a notch or two. Happy medium,  and all that.

            @Perpetual: It's still a problem that she never <em>acted accordingly</em>.  She can write letters about it all she wants,  but she never really let up on Cranky with the zaniness even after she was writing the letter.  She <em>said</em> she learned the moral,  but unless she actually <em>did</em> it by choosing to leave Cranky alone it kinda rings hollow.
<p></p>@Ginger: The substance of the moral was fine (some people just like their time alone and that should be respected),  the problem is that Pinkie never actually did that.

            If Pinkie could just be quiet and pleasant for a little bit,  it would do wonders. But alas,  people LIKE her like this.
<p></p>Even in the end,  she needed to be told to shut up by Cranky.

            Id be friends with a toned down Pinkie.. I think she'd be someone to sit and watch funny movies with and gorge yourself on popcorn and candy while doing so.  I just wouldnt want to have to get into fisticuffs with her over the last snacky cake.

            I have to disagree a bit the moral was perhaps flawed but looking at the episode's title
<p></p>"A friend in deed" = "A friend in need" I am sure a big part of the episode was pinkie helping someone in need,  something that was very nice of her.
<p></p>Forcing friendship aside. I admire pinkie for helping and looking for the welfare fo someone that made clear that detested her.
