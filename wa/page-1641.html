            I like Pinkie...  Just far less than the rest of the mane cast.  Like Ginger I'm annoyed that she's never the one acknowleged to make a mistake especially when there were three episodes ( Swarm of the Century,  Green Isn't your Color,  and Best Night Ever) where she clearly exacerbated the  problem.  I do like her cheery and happy go lucky attitude but I just wish she didn't "win" for once.

            Again I ask,  why is it that people say Pinkie is never wrong when there's at least one episode (<em>Party of One</em>) where she is?
<p></p>It's like people just keep forgetting that episode exists or something.

            @Rhyme: Even if you don't have a tablet at the moment,  you can still get better. Just find yourself some paper to scribble on - the skill is easily transferrable to a tablet. I learned to draw by just scribbling in the margins of my notebooks when I was supposed to be paying attention. Hell,  I still do it - it's why I never let any paper near me during a lecture anymore.
<p></p>I sort of get where Ginger is coming from with Pinkie. She's been the source of the problem in so many episodes,  and yet in each of them she's praised for being the <em>solution</em> to the problems. I was always ambivalent towards her myself,  not caring because she was comic relief at best,  but I can see why she would irk someone to no end.

            I'm indifferent to Pinkie. The only episode that made me totally and completely angry with her was <em>Luna,  Eclipsed</em>. That was her at her worst in my opinion.

            I just find pony-hating to be impossible.  They're all so damn cute,  even when they're being stupid and/or annoying!
<p></p>And anyway,  if I ever hated any of them <em>that</em> much,  I'd take solace in that I'll be able to beat them up once <em>Fighting is Magic</em> is finished.

She's already had an emotional breakdown for most of the episode,  and aside from a little awkwardness none of the other ponies suffered for her craziness.  She suffered,  she realized her friends wouldn't abandon her like that,  and she got better.  Aside from having more faith in her friends,  she didn't need a huge attitude shift from that episode.

            I don't think there's any pony who I find truly irritating. I dislike Pinkie when she's being really,  really bad (as she was in Luna,  Eclipsed. Seriously,  let's pretend to be afraid of the repentant princess who's trying to re-integrate into a society who spent the last 1000 years labeling her as a <em>monster</em>,  and make all the kids frightened of her! Anyone else,  and I'd just straight up call them a bitch),  but it's never so far as irritation,  just "Move on to the good character now plz".
<p></p>The only characters who I've never had issues with are Twi,  and AJ. Fluttershy is on the 'list' becuase she had me worried when she was being <em>super</em> cowardly in Return of Harmony Part 1.

Keeping a secret because you made a promise to someone is different from secretly talking shit about someone behind their back,  which Pinkie thought they were.  If a secret pertains to you specifically it isn't that unreasonable to want to know what it is.
