<p></p>Well,  the relationship between Rarity and Spike doesn't creep me out because Rarity doesn't reciprocate. If she did I would find it creepy.
<p></p>Also,  I'm reading <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lolita" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lolita">Lolita</a> right now. And... it's complicated material. In some ways,  it... explains WHY pedophilia is okay. That's why it's such a threatening book,  not because the guy just rapes a girl,  but because he actually gives a pretty good argument as to WHY. We're having a field day talking about the book in my English class right now to say the least.

            @Drenius I actually got in trouble for spitting on the graves of the soldiers who died in the Normandy Landings. Okay,  1.) It was accident,  a fly flew into my mouth. and 2.) It was during a thunderstorm and the wind blew my spittle over to the graves,  I was aiming into the sea!

            I think there would be. I'm assuming Equestria is generally open-minded about LGBT topics in general,  so I think they would probably accept trans without much issue. Although coming out and explaining your situation can be awkward,  even in open-minded environments....

            @Drenius given that I was wearing a tshirt and shorts and was in the middle of a thunderstorm,  I couldn't exactly stik around to apologize. I was pegging it. (for the bus bak to the hotel,  not to esape the people who worked there.)
<p></p>I still remember them calling after me though... I should've apologized. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">

            @crowlover: I was here,  I just was reading through it (as I said,  I don't usually thread hop aside from the very first time I discovered this thread) and doing some other things.  I know about that phenomenon,  as I've seen it mentioned in descriptions of some accents.
