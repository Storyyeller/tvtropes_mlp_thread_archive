            It was a bit of a one-two combo that got me into the show.  First,  a friend of mine linked me that really old Master Link X Youtube poop where the name was something like "Friendship is Magic is No Longer Available Due To a Copyright Claim By Habsro."  The animation grabbed my eye and I found myself wondering what was going on with it since it looked pretty new.  So off to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropes">TV Tropes</a> I went and started poking around the tropes page.  Read a bit about it,  was impressed with some of the trope examples,  decided to check out the first episode.
<p></p>Loaded up the first episode,  opening mythos grabbed my attention.  Theme song made me cringe (I've come to like it now,  though).  Within the first few minutes after that,  thought "Wow,  that purple pony is kind of a bitch" (hilarious in hindsight,  I know) for clobbering Spike with the door.  Got a little further (probably about the 7.5 minute mark) and suffered sugar overload.  Turned it off.  Came back the next day to give it a real fair shake.  From there I was pretty sure I liked it.  After Winter Wrap Up,  I was totally hooked,  though.

            General internet hype and a lack of good cartoons to watch got me to watch this show.
<p></p>@Ginger Applejack has been well liked from the beginning. She doesn't <em>need</em> a "redeeming" episode. None of them really do. Also,  A Dog and Pony Show is what made me like Rarity,  but it was retroactive.

            It was all the ponies that were popping up that made me curious enough to watch it.  Also the fact it was easily available on youtube.  If I had to hunt it down on some shady streaming site I wouldn't have bothered.

            @Ginger: Because she is the only pony who really hasn't annoyed me all that much this season,  along with Fluttershy. Plus I just like her. Being the cutest of the Mane Six doesn't hurt either.
<p></p>As for thoughts on the episode. It was fairly amusing. A good CMC episode. Less so for everyone else.

            It may simply have to do with their characters. Like,  Rarity actively tries to be better than she is,  so she seems more human in that degree. The others simply have their own little quirks and ways of doing it. Twilight,  for example,  feels a strong need to be perfect. Naturally then she's not going to have the same sorts of conflicts as Rarity - where the core of Rarity's conflicts come down to her overcoming her nature,  the core of Twilight's come down to her trying to correct a mistake or prevent something from happening. Rarity's conflicts are <em>in</em>ternal,  while Twi's are <em>ex</em>ternal.
<p></p>More to the point as you're likely talking about AJ,  AJ's major flaw is that in spite of what it may seem she's actually a very introverted and perhaps even a tad selfish person. Not in the bad way,  though,  mind. She simply considers her actions and the ramifications thereof more readily than other's opinions. The Last Roundup incident is a perfect example of that. He very first thought was "I have failed". It was not,  "What will the other ponies think of me, " It was not,  "How will they react",  it was "I have failed them. I have failed to meet my promise,  and I must atone". A moments thought would have told her her friends wouldn't care,  but she didn't consider their opinions. Instead,  she immediately considered what SHE would do. She's an incredibly driven pony,  but it's all internalized. She's driven to do what she thinks is right,  but she's not good at looking outside of it. She's incapable of noticing how her actions affect other ponies when she has her mind set on something. As such,  it's incredibly difficult for her to have internal conflict,  or to even have conflict localized on her. Because she's driven to succeed no matter what,  conflict around her is looney toons-esque,  pounding her head against an issue and trying to solve it on her own. It's simply not the same sort of plots as Rarity has,  and they aren't as 'human',  because she's not the kind of person who realizes when she's doing something stupid. she needs to be <em>forced</em> to see the error of her ways.
<p></p>A large part of it is actually to do with the element of honesty. She simply can't conceive of doing wrong,  so it doesn't occur to her that she is. I hate to apply the southern stereotype of narrow-mindedness,  but it's extremely difficult for a pony like her to consider something outside her realm of thinking. As such,  all of her conflicts and lessons sort of need to be external. Once the message is in there it <em>sticks</em>,  but it's got a damn hard time taking root.

            @Ginger Mio's probably mad at Rarity because she realized her mistake earlier and used it as a learning example for Sweetie Belle,  making her a hypocrite,  so that bumps her down and leaves Applejack on top.
<p></p>I can understand why Rarity's actions might annoy some people,  but in reality she reacted the most reasonable out of <em>anyone</em> that episode and actually learned something from it. At least,  that's how it looked to me.

            @Perpetual Lurker: Actually it had nothing to do with hypocrisy,  since most of the "grown up" ponies were being hypocritical and myopic anyway.
<p></p>It was more that she blabbed (possibly) the identity of Gabby Gums to the whole town. That was pretty terrible in my eyes.

            I like pretty much everypony. Twilight is easy to relate to,  Rarity is very realistic with her internal conflicts,  Fluttershy is too cute to not like,  and Rainbow Dash isn't as flat as she used to be. Pinkie can be more of a plot device than a character when she's not the focus,  and Applejack hasn't gotten much development,  but I like them both.

            In all honesty even Rarity's "invasion of privacy" wasn't that bad.  The bag fell open on it's own,  and the only thing she looked at was a <em>newspaper that is meant for mass consumption anyway</em>.  It's not like she was snooping around in Sweetie Belle's diary or anything...
