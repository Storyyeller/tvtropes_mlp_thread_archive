            Eh,  I'm apathetic towards Scootaloo. I wouldn't mind if she got an episode,  but I'd rather see somepony like Big Mac or Mayor Mare get an episode.
<p></p>By the way,  when can we expect confirmation of a full season?

<p></p>Just got back from seeing <em>The Avengers</em>.
<p></p>BEST MOVIE EVER.
<p></p>And I respectfully disagree with your opinion of Loki,  Ginger. He got plenty of good moments to make him a credible villain.
<p></p>One of my favorite parts was the Chitauri,  though. They were <em>awesome</em> mooks.

            I'd love more ensemble episodes.  The rewatch of S1 really reminded me how much more the cast was involved in the plot as a whole rather than being centered around 1 or 2 ponies.

            Just about everything suggested so far sound like it could make a great episode,  but I'm all for anything the crew puts out,  so long as it's up to the same quality they've been doing so far.

            @sky strike: You kinda shown my point there,  Dash is more of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt Monkey</a> in Season Two,  but these aspects also give her more pathos compared to her in Season One. As even more of a balance however we also had more enthasised kind/smart moments which shown the other side of her personality (eg. Hurricane Fluttershy).
<p></p>I also thought Fluttershy was a bit one note before Season Two episodes like Putting Your Hoof Down as well which explored more facets in her persona outside the meek guy in the team.
<p></p>Maybe this is why I thought Applejack was a bit blander in Season Two as well,  while she still had plenty of Straight Man moments she was more abrasive in Season One,  and seemed to have more pathos and unique interactions as a result.
<p></p>Twilight was probably the one at her best in both seasons,  as we got extremes of both sides of her persona,  the rashional straight guy and stuck up anal retentive.

            I'd love to see more episodes like Baby Cakes that flesh out the side characters while still incorporating the mane cast.  Like a "Twilight helps Cheerilee" episode (yeah,  I still want to see that),  or helping the Mayor with something.

            I still like my idea for an episode where Twi becomes the Mayor's assisstant,  but ends up doing such a good job that the town makes HER Mayor. Then she begins to crack under the pressure of trying to make EVERYPONY in town happy (like she promised)
