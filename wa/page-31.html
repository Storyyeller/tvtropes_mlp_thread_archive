            <div class="quoteblock">Twilight is an interesting case. At the beginning of the series we see she works in the capitol,  likely a book-keeper or what passes in Equestria for a lower-level bureaucrat. Her obsessiveness with rules and procedure bear this theory out,  but she's seen as willing to get her hands dirty so I suppose she's quite an effective bureaucrat. The Equestrian government seems quite efficient if Twilight is anything to judge by. She also clearly has experience organizing ponies as seen at the end of Winter Wrap-up and is a natural leader and a mediator. Perhaps she was a diplomatic functionary. an envoy? She's also a rationalist and a skeptic,  qualities that make sense for someone coming from the big city in to some podunk town in the middle of the Equestrian countryside (that has it's share of superstitions and xenophobia,  Zacora etc). Perhaps a scientist then? A scholar? Or would that be just a hobby?</div>
<p></p>Arguably,  she's more of a grad student,  currently conducting a research project on a generous stipend. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_wink.png" height="16" width="16" alt="wink" title="wink">

            Twilight is probably the most powerful pony we've seen other than the princesses. I think it makes sense for Celestia to be interested in helping her cultivate her abilities.
<p></p>This is even more plausible if you buy into the <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess"> that Twilight's magic has increased in power since she started making friends. After all,  friendship <em>is</em> magic.

The only things we've really seen her officially responsible for,  as far as I can remember,  is overseeing the Summer Solstice Festival (or whatever it was called) and moving the Dragon in Dragonshy,  which she could have just taken upon herself after speaking with the princess.
<p></p>Well,  I guess that would mean that she does have more responsibilities,  but she still seems a lot like a student. She blows off a party in the beginning because she has to study,  and she claims to study a LOT throughout the show. Add this to the fact that Celestia addresses her as 'My Faithful Student',  and I think that Twilight is in fact a student,  she just happens to be Celstia's private student,  or her apprentice. It may just have been that she did so well in her classes that Celestia suggested giving her extra work,  or Twilight requested it,  and eventually she just started learning from Celestia privately. In that regard,  the extra responsibilities make sense,  since that's the sort of things private teachers and master would reasonably do - have their students do field research,  or give them small responsibilities the master would otherwise do on their own. After all,  she's staying in Ponyville under the pretense of 'studying friendship and the magical properties thereof',  and she's shown to study in other fields,  likely taking other classes through correspondence.

<p></p>Since we have three traits,  we have six alleles. Dominant Unicorn,  recessive Unicorn,  and so on.

            Well,  yeah,  it's just...<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForRacist" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForRacist">mixing the breeds seems wrong to me.</a> Luna and Celestia are unicorn Pegasi,  sure,  but they're GODDESSES. Supposed to embody all three pony types,  etc etc. As far as we know,  it just doesn't happen otherwise. Having a Pony that blends two races could lead to a lot of what might be considered defects,  like a horn but no magic,  or wings that can't fly...hence my original issue. Although,  I don't think we've ever seen a cannon couple of mixed breeds,  so maybe it's verboten in Equestria,  perhaps for that exact reason.
<p></p>Of course,  that's a really broad generalization,  since there isn't just one 'human' gene,  or for the matter,  one 'race' gene (I assume,  since there are a lot of cosmetic differences,  at least). Wings and horns are presumably only one part of what makes a unicorn a unicorn and a Pegasus a Pegasus. One might be able to produce a child with the endurance of a earth pony with a Pegasus's wings,  or just the opposite...which would mean that somewhere out there there's what could only be called a 'mundane' pony,  which seems terribly unfair...oh my.

            Something tells me that it's just plain impossible to "mix" the two. Or at least,  very very hard. It's kind of like genders: the majority of the time,  either boy or girl. One way or the other,  no inbetween.
<p></p>And Celestia and Luna are basically just freaky genetic mutations: the hermaphrodites,  if I really must continue with this metaphor.

            That's my point: When Ori said that an eu pony would be 50/50 unicorn and earth,  I assumed he meant it would be 50% earth and 50% unicorn...the alternative interpretation being that it would have a 50% chance of being either Earth or Unicorn,  and (Again,  it's been a while since Bio,  so I could be wrong) GENETICS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY.
