            And Applejack spends the journey first really being excited about seeing them again,  then being nervous,  considering how <em>long</em> they've been away,  then being <em>furious</em>,  considering how long they've been <em>away</em>.
<p></p>I don't know what the circumstances would be,  but I can only imagine Applejack exploding into a rant about them before they finally reach them,  and then exploding into another one when they finally meet face to face.

Applejack doesn't bring it up,  because everyone there already knows; they've been gone so long that... well,  everything's been said already. A wistful wish on a pair of shooting stars that they might deign to show up for the biggest reunion in forever is about all there is to it anymore.

            @Enlong I prefer that over dead parents. I'm not sure if I even accept Word Of God on this mater,  only  in episode evidence (but I will not like it,  they need to do something really good for me to like it)
<p></p>And fact that they didn't appear or were mentioned during reunion is not proof because they didn't appear /were mentioned  during previous  reunions.

            I'd probably lean towards dead.  It just feels like it meshes with the setting better than abandonment would.

Dumbbell's father abandoned the family after Bell's twin younger siblings were born. Bell took it hard at first,  but eventually got used to it. when his dad came back later in Bell's life he was willing to forgive,  but the fact of the matter was he hadn't seen his father in over a decade and had moved on by that point. They're on fine enough terms but they hardly ever speak and when it comes down to it Bell just doesn't consider his father that important.</span>

            @JT: Maybe that could be true with RD and Fluttershy,  but how do you explain the abcense of Scootaloo's parents {And any other possible family members apart from any siblings since we know that she doesn't have those}? See,  the more episodes with her that we don't see her parents or anyone else from her family,  the more that I start to think that the "Orphan Scootaloo" fanon might actually be true,  or that the writers are just teasing us.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            @marston:  The absence of Scootaloo's family isn't that weird.  The show doesn't have so much running time that they can shove in additional characters just because they're related to characters we know.  We barely get to see any family of the mane cast,  with the exception of AJ,  and the only reason we know about AB and SB's families is because they're related to the mane cast.  Scootaloo has only had one episode,  and it was focused on her relationship with RD,  throwing her parents in there wouldn't have really added anything.

            so,  I'm watching wizard of oz,  and I of course started thinking about ponies. specifically,  a crossover. The beginning of oz is like canon material to crossover with any verse you want.

<p></p>You know,  it's interesting how we're <em>still</em> having a debate about Applejack's parents' deadness. They're like... Schrodinger's parents?

            In all seriousness I do find it curious they chose to be a bit ambiguous with Applejack's parents. The reason we all expected an answer is because her family is the most detailed in the show,  even more so than Twilight's,  and yet not a single mention of her parents. Even <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaurenFaust" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaurenFaust">Lauren Faust</a> admitted her team couldn't come to a decision when she was still on the show.
<p></p>If they <em>are</em> dead,  I don't see what's so taboo about directly saying so. As most of us know,  you can't do a Batman cartoon without bringing up <em>murdered parents</em> at least once. How many <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> cartoons have there been? Yes,  completely different franchise,  but the fact remains that the people who make Batman cartoons think the hero having <em>murdered</em> parents is kid friendly. Not just dead,  killed by a guy with a gun! Some of these cartoons even do a <em>flashback</em> to said killing! Seriously,  it amazes me how many Batman cartoons have been allowed to exist as oppose to other superheroes with less dark/tragic backstories,  but that's getting off topic.

            The thing is those Batman cartoons aren't aimed at <em>little</em> kids. Obviously <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a> pushed the envelope in that area though <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a> managed to get away with it as well. On the other hoof I've seen every episode of the old Adam West 60's version (I think) and Bruce's parents are never brought up at all. Back then it was probably of the thought that you can't do that in a show aimed at kids. The question becomes; how far along the sliding scale of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">Idealism vs.Cynicism</a> is FiM? Are there any other kids shows that actually have dealt with dead parents?
