            Actually,  I have this whole big headcanon backstory worked out for Celestia and Luna's usage of the Elements for my fic,  so I'm a little biased in this discussion,  to say the least. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            When I had to choose a fanon explanation for the Elements' origin in my fic,  I also went with them being manufactured (although something carefully researched and crafted,  with more time required to realize a fraction of their power and even longer than that to realize their true potential,  rather than ancient technology).

<p></p>... I'm assuming that's a typo,  and you meant "I hope she <em>doesn't</em> have an abusive pony owner"
<p></p>Actually I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with Megan,  because I haven't had to think in-depth about Dream Valley yet.  I'm thinking that either she's owned by Firefly,  or else she's not a pet—because of her accomplishments in Dream Valley she may be considered a "special" human and for that reason completely above the whole pet/not-a-pet issue.
<p></p>I'm working on Chapter Four of "Surprise Days" right now.  This one's either gonna concern <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a witch who sacrifices ponies to demons for power</span> or else <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a baby Discord,  and why Pinkie Pie hates Surprise</span>.  I'm strongly leaning towards the latter one.

            @Ginger What? You really need to stop with the persecution complex.
<p></p>In any case,  I don't think that even Celestia and Luna know where the Elements came from. Celestia said that she and Luna "discovered" them to defeat Discord the first time,  so it's unlikely that they were around for their creation.

<p></p>that's the thing,  you don't need extensive knowledge(or headcanon) of any particular verse for this kinda discussion. You just need extensive knowledge of the genre,  in this case fantasy.
<p></p>and my extensive knowledge of fantasy works tells me to agree with lurker on this. The elements can defeat(for any given definition of defeat) anything,  so long as it actually needs defeating for the cause of peace and harmony. You try abusing them,  and they're gonna stop working.

            I'm a big fan of corruption and such,  hence why one of my fic ideas revolved around the concept that Celestia was letting certain ultra powerful beings go in order to toughen the mane cast up and affect the elements in certain ways so that when the time came,  and she was possessed in some way,  that she could be stopped

            Honestly,  I think the biggest point of contention that there is to have with the Elements is whether or not Celestia and Luna actually did wield multiple Elements at once,  or if they had other bearers with them,  each of them only wielding one Element as the Mane 6 do.
<p></p>My headcanon is that the Elements can't double up on a bearer,  but that leaves the identities of the other four bearers a mystery,  and raises the question of why they aren't recorded on the stained glass windows in Canterlot along with Celestia and Luna for their accomplishments,  which I also have worked out for my story.
