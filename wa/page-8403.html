            I'm honestly surprised at how much video game logic is crammed into that story,  and how much people don't seem to care. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding">Pip's saddlebags are bottomless.</a> The <em>one</em> time she wasn't able to fit anything in was when she tried to <em>stuff a whole assault rifle in them</em>.  The fact that she even <em>tried</em> has to say something.

            Ooh! I <em>do</em> have it. Here we go,  a short list of ways in which the story annoys me:
<p></p>1. Littlepip isn't a likable protagonist. She's annoying. Every time
she has a "I was so morally outraged and I wanted to kill them all"
moment I go "oh just shut up and get on with it."
<p></p>2. Littlepip is inconsistently characterized. For example,  chapter 4
largely consists of her scavenging weapons and armor. Then in chapter
5 when she's in the stable with Calamity the narration (see point 3)
gives us a pang of outrage at how Calamity is looting the place.
Might've been a nice spot for introspection and character development, 
but then in chapter 6 she's right back to fishing through the bodies
of the slavers she guns down. So all it does is make her look like a
bit of a hypocrite. Similar problem arises with the way the story
tries to present Littlepip as a paragon of goodness and compassion and
then has her being extraordinarily ruthless to her enemies (the whole
"gunning down a terrified,  fleeing raider" bit in chapter 3 left a bad
taste in my mouth).
<p></p>Furthermore,  for a character who's established as being very
analytical and intelligent,  the attack on the slaver camp in
Appleloosa was kinda stupid and ill-conceived.
<p></p>3. The narration is melodramatic and the flowery descriptions are at
odds with the character's generally terse speaking patterns. The whole
"moral outrage" bits also fall into the problem,  where they stop being
about telling the audience how the character feels and become the
author trying to tell the reader how to feel.
<p></p>4. Ham-fisted attempts at MORAL AMBIGUITY fall flat when A. all the
antagonists introduced thus far have been more or less on the level of
cackling "I bathe in the fresh blood of babies" types (also,  that
alicorn was freaking annoying. When Littlepip killed her I wasn't
cheering because it was an awesome display of willpower for her,  I was
glad because the dumb thing finally shut up) (also,  yes yes,  Red Eye, 
whatever) and B. all the introspection about "was I right to kill?"
and stuff has,  from what I have gleaned from conversations,  absolutely
no payoff whatsoever.
<p></p>5. Velvet Remedy is annoying. So far all she's done is "heals, "
exposition,  and "whine about killing." Fun fact: I'm a pacifist. This
is the character that I'm supposed to identify with (well,  at least
until she starts brandishing a shotgun like everyone else),  and all
I'm getting is "this is our party medic. She also doubles as the token
strawman pacifist,  largely because she's our party medic."
<p></p>6. Calamity is failing to register as anything other than "Hat and
Accent with guns and the occasional wisecrack." Until I am given a
reason to care,  I will simply refer to him as Hat/Accent.
<p></p>7. The action scenes are BORING. In fact,  with how there are time
skips in them,  it's like the story itself agrees with me and wants to
get them out of the way.
<p></p>8. I haven't played the games,  but things about the setting don't make
sense. So apparently the wasteland is a lawless hellhole,  but there
are still plenty of towns,  mass communications,  long-distance travel...

            @Blissey: I think one of the show's charms is that it takes character and story concepts that have been done to death and yet implements them in one of their most charming and endearing manners. This does mean things get rather predictable at times,  but it's fun and there are at least a few twists at times.

            Evil raiders aren't always that hostile monsters.  One time some doctor where was in similar situaion what Velvet was,  well expecting it was,  he said he suspected injured raider wanting help (it was Deathclaw). So that stuff with Velvet is  very believable.

            Well it is based off of a video game... It wouldnt really be fallout without it.
<p></p>Although you do have an encumbrance in Fallout... maybe she just has a really high STR score or spent points on the strong back and packrat perks.
