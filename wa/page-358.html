            Then again,  if it's rude for Trollestia to ruin the Gala for the other Gala-goers,  how do we know that they themselves weren't just coming to keep up appearances? Plenty of high-society members just come to functions just so they can be seen,  even if they're a complete snorefest or horrible.

            but if that's true there's no reason for Celestia to keep the gala going. She's clearly smart enough to be <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a> so she should be able to tell that people aren't enjoying the gala,  and if they don't,  she's in charge so she could just change it.

            but that's just it,  people were clearly not enjoying Pinkie's shenanagains. It would have been the simpler and kinder thing to just announce the cancellation of the gala (she is GOD after all),  rather than inviting people just to cause havoc and potentially hurt someone (that accident in the end could have seriously hurt people) just because YOU don't like it

            The odds of her knowing it would go <em>so</em> far south are unlikely. But really,  I think that there is some sort of importance to the gala. It's boring for her,  yes,  and it may even be boring for the guests. But they go for the  sake of appearance; how do we know Celestia doesn't do the same? There's an obvious aristocratic system in place in Equestria,  and noone would be pleased if the ruler just said 'fuck that' now would they? And she can't just change the system on a whim; it would create a huge social upheaval,  causing trouble for the ponies who were in the middle,  and making for lots of unhappy ponies who used to be on the top. She hasn't got much of a choice in the matter here. She has to keep up the 'majestic and glorious goddess' shtick to keep everything steady.

<p></p>but if that was the case,  then the guests would have been more receptive to Pinkie's partying,  and at least a few more would have bought Applejack's food,  and by the end,  the gala didn't change. It would have been one thing if the event enlightened the aristocrasy to their stuck up ways and advised them to take it easy,  but that's not what we see,  we see innocent guests having their party ruined by a select few people who were acting obnoxious and inappropriately. Nothing is gained except a new moral for the mane cast,  and that Celestia's boredom is eased,  somewhat.

            Celestia may be a goddess and a <span class="strike">Queen</span>princess,  but the aristocracy has historically never been all that cowed by people who should have absolute power over them.  While I don't think Celestia invited the Ponyville girls to the Gala with the intent to ruin it for anypony,  she definitely wanted to shake things up a little.  How much things were shaken up,  I doubt even she could have guessed.

            The issue is very clear IMO.
<p></p>The show is telling us that acting like a snob or like a high society just for appearances is bad.The aristocrats were portrayed as snobbish,  boring and selfish, 
<p></p>With the exception of Rarity because she has a good heart and despite being a lady-like she does care for others and doesn't see herself as "superior".
<p></p>Hence the reason Celestia did all of this.

            Implying that serious and stuffy is the trait of a "bad person".
<p></p>When you think of it,  Pinkie Pie could very well have been the "bad person",  from a certain point of view.
<p></p>^ It's Rarity. Did you expect anything less? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            Yeah they weren't evil,  but their Attitude was what the show criticized.Orange's friends in CMC crusaders for instance.
<p></p>With Pinkie they were shown as boring an more concerned with appereance.
With Aj they were shown as uncaring an with a superiority attitude
with twilight we were shown how boring and strict their protocols were.

<p></p>That's my only complaint. With Pinkie's parents it shows them accepting Pinkie's parties and lightening up. With the Gala,  we don't see what happens after the mane cast leaves,  or whether the guests accepted them,  and I didn't see any indication that they were all <em>that</em> snobby. They were eating (snobby food but I like hourdeurves),  socialising with friends or other dignatries,  and listening to music (which was nice and appropriate,  as they said It's not <em>that</em> kind of party)
