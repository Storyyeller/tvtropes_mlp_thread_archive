            I think in Fall Weather Friends,  most of the issue was on RD's side; Applejack cheated,  but that was more a case of trying to level the playing field after RD started it.  But yeah,  RD's obsession with winning is a flaw,  but I think there are other aspects of her personality that balance it out.  Other people have already pointed it out,  so I won't bother elaborating.

            I bought myself the pie family rock farm shirt.  Not sure if it was worth the nearly $30 after using a promo code,  but I'm happy to support the company and get some merch that I display without feeling uncomfortable.
<p></p>Now they just need to get working on a proper dvd release.  There's no way in hell I'm buying those <em>things</em> they're putting out right now.

            Am I the only one who thinks that Spike needs more interaction with characters his own age? It's interesting because when he's with the girls he usually acts the most kiddish (when he's not being the Only Sane Man anyway),  but amongst the other children he's by far the most intelligent and mature of them all.
<p></p>I think it'd make for some nice dynamics

            I think it might be sort of interesing to see him get dragged along on one of the CMC adventures. Or maybe he'll wind up palling around with Pipsqueak,  or something.

            I think all of the mane characters are fundamentally good; despite their personal flaws,  they do genuinely care for each other and don't want to cause harm.  If they do anything "bad",  it's typically out of ignorance rather than malice (see Pinkie Pie in "Luna Eclipsed").
<p></p>And I predict that's one of the reasons Pipsqueak was introduced — to give a new character for the CMC and/or Spike to play off of.

            In my headcanon I think he pals around with some of the other colts in Ponyville. Like in <em>Dangerous Business</em> he was happy at getting to spend time with Big Macintosh even though he was having to do something soil related.

            ^^Applebloom is a late bloomer,  anyway; she and Twist were the last in their class,  weren't they?  I think the latest we've seen a filly get her cutie mark is definitely Fluttershy,  though really,  it depends on how much younger than the Crusaders Applejack was when the Sonic Rainboom happened.  (Applejack mentions she was younger than they were when she left for Manehattan,  after all,  and the Crusaders haven't hit the Gangly Fluttershy Stage yet,  so we can assume either that that's a Fluttershy thing,  or that the Crusaders can expect to start getting gangly soon as well.)
<p></p>If I had to guess,  the Crusaders are around 11 or 12; with Fluttershy being the oldest of the mane cast at late 12 or early 13 at the Rainboom.  Pinkie would be bringing up the rear at late 11 (she's the shortest when she's a filly,  and she just looks smaller and squishier,  so I imagine she's the youngest.)

The CMC are in the general ballpark of "elementary school",  and can fluctuate from anywhere from 1st to 6th grade depending on the plot.  (I know 6th grade is sometimes considered middle school,  but that fits with the cutie mark = puberty allusion).
