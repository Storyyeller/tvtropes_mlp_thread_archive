Specifically that they wanted to put Winter Wrap Up before Fall Weather Freinds,  even though,  to them,  the events took place the other way around.
<p></p>Hell Luna Eclipsed only took place about 4 months after the pilot. It was Twi's first NMM in Ponyville. Makes a lot of the issues people have with Luna not having adjusted to modern times rather void.

<p></p>Given that this is <em>the</em> biggest social event in the country,  I'd say that this could imply that it's anything from a month to several months in the future. "Coming up" is a <em>really</em> vague way to refer to time.  And besides,  even if we took that,  it still doesn't necessitate the series taking place over more than a year.  Personally,  I'd say it takes place over a total of maybe 18 months to 2 years.  It's long enough for Twilight to be reasonably integrated into Ponyville,  but not long enough that it's weird for the CMC to not have <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CMs">C Ms</a> yet.

            The point of season 1 was to cover broad aspects of Equestria so the writers used holidays and events to show that. The WWU for instance was written to show clearly and firmly establish pegasi changing the weather and that ponies made artificial seasons.
<p></p>The only other episode fitting in the first year is Luna Eclipsed with the other seasons happening in their own years.
<p></p>And that only because it was Twi's first.
<p></p>However,  I will say the two year theory has equal evidence.

            Starting with late season 2,  there are a lot more continuity nods,  so they probably took place in regular order.

The continuity was loose in 1,  so thus the anacronic order and not missing much connection. Season 3 at least takes place in order given the stricter continuity.
<p></p>In general there's too much character develpment for the entire thing to be crammed into a year. Two is workable,  but I'd give 3 if only for time to inject some realism as the characters are much more fleshed out.

            Well,  I just got some DJ-quality headphones with high sound isolation and base,  so I'd gladly take some pony music,  preferably good electronic.

            I hope the season has a Scootaloo episode,  because they established that she's now Dash's pupil,  and it would be a letdown if that was never heard from again.

            We know there's an episode that at least makes reference to her inability to fly. If that's not a scootaloo episode,  I'll eat a hat...ful of skittles.

            Watch  the con season 4 highlight dude. It has SS and DT mocking Scoots for her lack of flight,  more or less what we'd hoped for.
