            I think I'll use this opportunity to mention my opinions on the Avengers,  since I just saw it recently.
<p></p>Thor - Pretty cool guy,  very blunt.
<p></p>Hulk - Banner is a bit odd,  and his sudden ability to control the Hulk seems rather unexplained. I was able to infer about it via the internets though.
<p></p>Cap -  My personal favorite. I love his strong morals and old-fashioned attitude.
<p></p>Iron Man - He's funny,  but he's also a douchebag.
<p></p>Hawkeye - Doesn't really do much.
<p></p>Black Widow - Same as Hawkeye.

            I like Banner simply because he's such an emoional and psychological wreck.  But I suppose my favorite avenger would be Stark.  I loved him as a kid even if I didn't fully grasp how  much alcohol controlled his life.
<p></p>@ Sky:  Hawkeye doesn't do much?  At least in the comics Hawkeye was the heart and soul of the Avengers,  besides he was trained both as an acrobat and by a swashbuckling Frenchman and was handy with a sword.  How can you beat a swashbuckler?

            When I'm in alicorn/unicorn form,  I usually just use telekinesis. Mjolnir's specifically bonded to my magic. When I'm a pegasus/EP,  I just hold it in my mouth. That's a bit more awkward though.

            @story I'd like to think the Wolfbats paid them off and Amon just took advantage. Of course,  you could always suggest Amon and the Wolfbats are in cahoots.
<p></p>@Drenius It bothered me how OP he was with that bow. He just shot one of those carriers in the face without even looking! At least Loki out-<a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OPed" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OPed">O Ped</a> him by catching that arrow.

            Also,  the intro to this series is so hilariously short and lacking,  without any mention of danger in it. I mean there obviously is the thing with Amon,  but no,  they're not allowed to change their intros ever. So now it's just a short clip with no sense of danger whatsoever.

            @Fallen We're not too close. Going from Asgard to Ponyville takes a while,  since Bifrost is usually so crowded. Direct travel involves tearing holes in time and space,  and only Loki can really do that well.

            @story It's way too abrupt,  yeah.
<p></p>@Drenius Don't get too excited,  it's just a team name. Wolfbats were in the original series,  in "Cave of Two Lovers".
<p></p>@ginger Maybe during Season 3,  since that's when it got more serious.

<p></p>Oh comics,  this comics that. If you're only going by the movie like me,  then Tony and Bruce are the only characters that actually have a personality. And Iron Man,  Hulk,  and Thor are the only ones who can contribute in a fight.

            @Freeman I can see Amon doing that to cover his tracks. He's not a hypocrite by teaming with benders if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he takes their powers later.</span> But if you're really paranoid,  you could say <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tahno was really an Equalist at heart and gave up his powers for the cause.</span> That's highly unlikely though.
<p></p>@story But Cap! His magnificent morals! One of my favorite lines was the one about Thor:

<p></p>OP? Too bad he was still overshadowed once the real superheros got their act together.
<p></p>Also,  no way was Tahno an equalist. He's one of the least likely ever. And I never saw Cave Of Two Lovers. Do you think I should?
