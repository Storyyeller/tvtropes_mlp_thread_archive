            <div class="quoteblock">@Ginger: Why do you hate the Complete monster trope anyway? I mean,  for instance,  The joker is usually portrayed as one,  especially in The dark knight,  but he's still an awesome villain.</div>
<p></p>Can't speak for Ginger but Joker is the type of villain I'm not a fan of.
<p></p>1)  He has absolutely no real motive.  He just does it "Because he's crazy."  I never got that about animation and comic fansâ€”the Joker does things just to be evil,  and somehow he's "creepy" or "well-written" for it,  but if <em>absolutely any other villain in any media ever</em> is like that,  at least obstensibly,  they're bad villains by default (see: Captain Planet,  even though all of them were a lot more developed than the Joker was)
<p></p>2)  Almost by the same token,  that "craziness" is what makes him dangerous... supposedly.  The truth is though,  hundreds of people are whacko,  and without any actual powers to back up his mad genius,  Joker is just a little guy with big ideas... like so many bloggers.  I can't suspend my disbelief long enough to believe this guy is an archfiend.  Again this is another thing that,  <em>when any other villain</em> does it,  its "bad writing" but somehow its okay when its the Joker.
<p></p>3)  His archnemesis is a billionaire with <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpowers" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpowers">Charles Atlas Superpowers</a> and equipment that rivals NASA.  Joker is in a LOWER social position,  has LESS resources and is,  himself,  physically and mentally WEAKER than the guy he's supposed to threaten.  That has always been the biggest failing of the character in my estimation.  The villain needs to obstensibly be bigger,  stronger,  better-equipped than the hero in every way so he's a challenge.  That's why in Resident Evil you play as a normal human and not Tyrant,  why in Final Fantasy VII you're a down-on-your-luck ex Soldier and not the head of Shinra,  why in Chrono Trigger you play as kids and not Lavos himself.
<p></p>Stopping there because no feel like starting new shitstorm.

            Oh boy,  I just watched that documentry on BBC Three called <em>Can We Trust The Police?</em> again.  I missed the start of it last time y'see.
<p></p>It really makes me ashamed to admit that I used to want to be one.
<p></p>There's one story highlighted in it that makes me see red.  In 2008,  a father and his two boys were out to see the Chelsea match.  Afterwards,  they went to a pub to light one of the kids use the bathroom.  Trouble flared,  and police forced everyone out,  seperating the boy from his brother and father.  The brother made the mistake of making eye contact with this uniformed thug with a dog.  He challenged this fourteen year old kid,  who just tried to back off.  For that,  he sets the dog on him.  When the father tries to get this rapid dog off his child,  the cops lay into him,  and give him a broken rib and puncured lung!  CCTV footage shows the two of them being squashed and man handled by a total of nine cops.  The badly battered father was charged with assaulting the dog.
<p></p>No justice there.  If I had my way,  that fat pig who started the whole thing would have at the very least have been fired.  Perferably,  he would have done 5 years hard time.  If I <em>really</em> had my way...he'd be publicly flogged.

It makes me glad the only run ins with cops I've had are the kind involving traffic.  Though even they were asses for the most part.  I'm honestly not sure how thoroughly corrupt the police are in my area,  but there has been at least one instance of an off-duty officer drawing his side arm and killing someone within the last three years.

            I've always viewed a Complete Monster as the kind of bad guy who's pure evil and with no redeeming quality's to speak of,  along with usually doing things that earn the title and not end up as a sterotypical bad guy or just a mere,  gigantic <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>.

            @ginger By listen to music,  I assume you mean not ingame music. Since I'm the only one in this thread who really plays it,  I just feel like your guide to the game,  so I feel obligated to ask.

            I think Joker's saving premise is charisma,  his personality is amusing which makes it easy to overlook his shortcomings as a villain. It's also an arguable reason he isn't a full on Complete Monster,  who aren't allowed to have any charming or humorous facets.
<p></p>Him killing and causing chaos <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheLulz" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheLulz">For the Lulz</a> is a very basic thing,  but him doing it with the zany charm he often shows is entertaining. When an associate disagrees with him,  he doesn't shoot them or give a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilenceYouFool" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilenceYouFool">Silence, You Fool!</a> monologue,  he calmly shakes their hand with a <em>fatal buzz shocker</em> all the while laughing maniacally and making insane quips,  before calmly chatting with the chared corpse.
<p></p>@ginger: I'm guessing it involves Mr Krabs' Jerkass Flanderization,  which among many moments disliked by the fanbase,  includes harrassing Plankton disproportionately or unprovoked to the point he looks like the actual instigator (the point he tried to torture Plankton to the point of suicide is especially hated). He's also a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a> in most cases,  which are commonly hated even more. I admit I hate this type of development <em>a lot</em>,  but I would hardly say Krabs is a Complete Monster,  just the writers' bad attempts at writing darker humor.

            All I'm going to say about the cop thing is that there are assholes in every profession; cops just get a lot of press over it.  You can't judge the job as a whole by the fact that there are jackasses involved.   The cops who spend their time busting drug lords are out there,  they just don't get the press.
<p></p>As for the thread and it's topics,  I'd kinda prefer that it remain on topic,  but given that we don't really have any new incoming material I can't complain too much,  especially since I haven't really been helping.  And like Seraphem said,  I'd rather have on topic  than off topic,  but I'd rather have off-topic than no posts at all.
