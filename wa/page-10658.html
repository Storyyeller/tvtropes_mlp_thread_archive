<p></p><span class="blue">Dealing with threats like that can be handled in a way that really isn't dark at all though.  Bad guys show up,  cause trouble,  get beat,  everything goes back to being fine.  In all three cases,  there was no lasting harm (that we know of).  Everything turned out fine.  In Nightmare Moon's case,  it even turned out to have a purely <em>positive</em> effect.  Celestia got her long lost sister back.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">Scoots turning out to be permanently handicapped is a whole different thing.  There's no solution,  it's a problem that would cause her grief her whole life.  That's dark.</span>

            @Kyler When she was turned to stone.
<p></p>For a change of topic (but not necessarily a less depressing one),  there was <em>another</em> episode idea detailed in that video that was a bit less fleshed out,  details-wise.
<p></p>Applejack and Rainbow Dash go on a bit of an adventure and end up in Whitetail Woods. There,  they come across a family of deer... and one pony. That pony had sticks tied to his head like antlers,  and apparently thought that he was a deer himself,  having been abandoned as a foal and raised by the deer as one of their own. RD and AJ debate whether or not to inform the pony that he is actually a pony and if they should try to bring him back with them. There wasn't any word on how Lauren intended that episode to turn out,  though.

            I bet they wouldn't tell the pony,  and the lesson would be that family is not necessarily who you were born to,  but who loves you.

            Blue: There was still the threat of some really bad stuff going down.  But let's say we discount the stuff that ends happily.  That's Discord and Nightmare Moon.  Or sure,  Canterlot Wedding ended in victory.  But the whole concept of what the changelings do is pretty dark,  really.  And they're still out there.  All of them.
<p></p>EDIT: And I should add without an easy method of detection.  Even Celestia,  despite all her power,  was fooled by Chrysalis.

            Just having a similar dream to RD wouldn't necessarily preclude being her own person.  If Scoots ever did become a great flier I get the feeling her stunts would be a lot different from RD's.
