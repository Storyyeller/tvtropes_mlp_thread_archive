            Why does it need to be perfectly balanced like that?  This is a group of friends,  it isn't like they keep tabs on who's screwed up more.  If you need a consequence for her actions,  consider that most of the cast is annoyed by her a fair bit.  We don't see much of it,  but there's probably a bit of alienation there.

            Ginger,  is there no such thing as a middle ground for you? A few people,  not EVERYONE,  mind you,  think good of pinkie in a few specific situations.  You take this as them declaring her to be absolutely perfect and beyond fault and best pony forever. You jump to extremes and take it as a personal affront at the slightest disagreement,  when their opinions are not nearly as extreme as you seem to think. To people watching you rant then,  you look like some sort of raving madman. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions,  you included,  so don't take offense when others disagree with you.

            @Crow Because I like things being balanced. I ust want things to be fair. It's why I go nuts over the power level thing. I don't get why people defend it by saying "it's more realistic" I don't care. I don't watch this show for realism.

            Ginger,  if I don't see a smiley on the end of that I'm pimp slapping you into next week. Seriously. this is excessive,  and we've seen what happens when someone lets themselves get upset.
<p></p><ul><li>Pinkie's song aggravated the war,  regardless of her intent. If she hadn't broken out the song and dance,  Thunderhooves would have called the whole thing off and maybe they could have talked it out.
</li><li>Pinkie never once tried to explain what she was doing. She just ran in,  asked for a tuba or some shit,  then left. Granted nopony else <em>asked</em>,  but they were kinda fucking busy,  and Pinkie should have had the courtesy to say "Hey guys,  I know how to stop these things" when it was clear nopony had any idea what she was on about
</li><li>Again,  regardless of intentions she still fucked up,  and <em>that's</em> what counts. Even her good intentions were pretty selfish on the whole,  and lacked a hell of a lot of foresight. She was using Luna as a running joke,  and she <em>knew</em> that she had turned good,  <em>and</em> the source of the legends. It does not take a genius to put two and two together there.
</li></ul><p></p>There,  you see Ginger? Calm and rational debate. It isn't hard. There are plenty of point to refute,  and if you can't find any you may have to rethink your argument. This is not a hard concept to grasp. You don't have to explode and get yourself banned. Seriously. I like you,  I don't want to see you banned. Chill the fuck out,  man.

            @Chariot:
<p></p><ul><li>She was trying to make peace <em>in a way that she should have known wasn't going to work</em>.  Good intentions doesn't justify the fact that the Chief might not have attacked if she had kept her mouth shut.  Given what we see in the episode,  it's fairly plain that if she wouldn't have reprised her song,  things would have gone very differently.
</li><li>When you're the only person aware of a potential danger,  it's your responsibility to inform people about it.  All she had to say was "if we don't get rid of these things they'll eat all our food,  and by the way we can use music to lead them out of the town",  but she <em>didn't do that</em>.  All she said was "Ew a Parasprite!  Somepony get me a trombone!" and then ran away.  Yes,  the other cast should have questioned a bit more,  but there were definitely communication issues on Pinkie's end.  You cannot convince me that if you gave the knowledge of parasprites to <em>any other pony</em> they would have solved the problem in short order.  The entire episode focuses on Pinkie just throwing up her hooves at the first sign of opposition and doing everything herself.
</li><li>The Luna thing is more a case of ignorance rather than anything else,  but it still implies a communication issue on Pinkie's part.  The insensitivity isn't that she was having fun,  it's that she was having fun <em>at Luna's expense</em>.
</li></ul><p></p>Anyway,  yeah,  we should drop this.  I need to go to bed anyway.  Hopefully I'll actually be able to watch the episode tomorrow.

            <ul><li>We saw Thunderhooves about to stand down when she pissed him off again. The show made a point of showing it to us. We know for a fact the problem would have solved itself without here there.
</li><li>They brushed her off because she was being zany about it. If she had simply said "I know how to solve the problem",  it's not like they would have assumed she was too dumb to know what she was talking about. Lord knows they tried everything else.
</li><li>She was just having fun - at the expense of another pony. I think that goes <em>beyond</em> insensitive. She constantly made jokes about how bad another pony was,  and got others doing it too. That's practically <em>bullying</em>,  even if it wasn't mean spirited.

            @Chariot:
<p></p><ul><li>There's no indication that it would have happened anyway.  Thunderhooves was considering calling off the attack until Pinkie did her song
</li><li>She attempted to explain it <em>once</em>,  badly and in a way that made it sound like she was joking.  Also,  at that point she was the only one who knew the parasprites were a danger,  so it makes sense that the others didn't pay attention anyway.  But once they start multiplying she should have stood up and said "I know how to solve this!",  not run around and do it herself.
</li><li>Um,  no they didn't.  Twilight didn't,  and most importantly <em>Luna</em> didn't.  The whole episode hinged on that.  Pinkie was making all the ponies (genuinely) afraid of Luna,  who just wanted the ponies to like her.
</li></ul><p></p>Okay,  I'm voting to drop the issue.  I'm sick,  and need more sleep.

            So I'm going to keep trying to change the subject.  Please do the same,  this is going nowhere.
<p></p>The description of the Cider Squeeze episode says that the Apple family is in a contest for the ownership of the farm.  I'd been wondering why they would agree to a contest that risks losing their home,  but what if they are already in danger of losing it and the contest is their attempt to get it back?

<p></p><ul><li>Because it wouldn't have happened. Again,  we saw Thunderhooves perfectly willing to stand down before she started dancing.
</li><li>They were a bit busy to notice anything aside from "Tuba. Now." Besides,  Pinkie being Pinkie she could have been pulling off some bizarre project for the party,  since parties are sort of her thing.

And even if they did,  Luna didn't know,  so she was playing up a town wide joke on a very guilty pony who only wanted to make some friends,  and <em>didn't understand why everypony was so afraid of her</em>.
