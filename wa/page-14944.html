            From what I've heard from the older collector fans,  they felt weird. Seems to have been a combination of bewilderment and surprise that the franchise would get so many male fans. More than anything,  it seems to have been more that MLP would ever get so mainstream again.

            @Death Cloud: Reactions are varied. Some are positive (like Posey),  others have been burned buy some initial waves of Brony trolls and don't like us. Others resent the our influence on the toy line (molded hair).

            I'm just glad that most of the calls themselves were fairly simple. One of the parents is giving the school a bunch of crap and if I had gotten stuck talking to her I'd probably be insane right now.

            I'm asking about little girls,  like those from that comic.  I know how older pre FIM fans of MLP reacted (ranging from true fans brony hater to possitive embrace of new fandom).
<p></p>There should be more focus on target audience reaction. Here on this wiki reactions of girls to this show is usually ignored.

            @Applelight: Re-enrollment application for next year.  First off,  it was due back in February and she just turned it in a week ago (when we asked her earlier she said she wasn't coming back next year),  and then when she turned it in,  the entire office staff basically went "lolno" as soon as she left.
<p></p>Doesn't help that we think she's only applying because the kid wants to go to the Summer Camp the school holds,  which is only available to returning students.
<p></p>I wonder if Cheerilee ever has to put up with that sort of BS.

            A random thought came to me since EQG confirms that Alternate Universe's are canon: In the Sonic Archie Comics,  there's a parrel dimension were the charectors are the moral oppisite of the ones we all know and love {I.E. Sonic/Scourage is a giantic Bad-boy type sadistic <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who took over the planet at one-point,  Robotnick is a kind vet worker who's nonetheless a huge threat to Sonic's group,  Tails is a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius">Evil Genius</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">The Starscream</a> to Sonic,  etc}. Now,  if there was a universe like this but with ponies instead,  what would the evil versions of the charectors we all know and love be like? At the very least I'm sure Celestia would act a lot like how she does in the Tyrant Celestia meme,  and since RD has enough simularity's to Sonic as it is,  her evil counterpart would probably be similar to Scourage in some ways.
<p></p>Also,  it doesn't have to be a grimdark or anything. The Sonic comics that this suggestion is based on arn't all that dark in the first place,  or at least not with this particular idea.

            A bit ironic considering a show meant for little girls has so few records of the target audience. Genuine girl fans are hard to find.
<p></p>If it counts,  That Brony Kid on Youtube has a few videos featuring a 3-year-old boy fan. It's pretty adorable.

            So I got my ass in gear and I know what to do with my story:
<p></p>I'm going to write three starting chapters,  one about each of the lead concepts I have.  Whichever one is the best received is the one which will be the story.
<p></p>It's explained better on my google doc.

            That's actually basically how I started writing. Started a few stories and then went with the one that was working the best.
<p></p>As for morality switched!AU!versions of the characters: Trixie is humble and works backstage. Cadance is Chrysalis!Cadance. Chrysalis is a doctor without borders.
