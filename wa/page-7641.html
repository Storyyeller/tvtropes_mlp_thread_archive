            My dreams always go surreal. Usually it's the fantastic building which has taken the place of a real shop or something that tips me off.

            @Sereg I'd be more ok with Twilight's power if people weren't so in awe of it and going on about how amazing she is all the time.

            So is anyone going to attempt the game I proposed in <a class="urllink" href="../wa/page-7640.html#post-190993">this post<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>?
<p></p>For some reason,  I tend to go lucid when I have nightmares.  Like one time I dreamed I was being chased by a creature who had the head of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentHill" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentHill">Pyramid Head</a> but the body of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MastersOfTheUniverse" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MastersOfTheUniverse">Skeletor</a>,  and for some reason I ran slow like I was stuck in molasses or something.  All the sudden I realized this was B.S. and was able to control it.  So I guess instead of focusing on Ponies,  I should find stuff that really scares me and fill my subconscious with it.

            If I ever woke up one day with a pony in my bed,  I would probably scream. Because ponies shouldn't be real. Except for real ponies,  because they're,  you know,  <em>real</em> ponies. But then if I woke up one day with a real pony in my bed,  I would probably scream anyway. Because there shouldn't be a pony in my bed to begin with.

Not I,  sir,  I'm afraid I don't have the kind of creativity for a feat of that magnitude.

            Made another edit.
<p></p>@Moe: If I have the time.
<p></p>@Ginger: Whooves is most concerned with Twilight because she's the one he knows the best. Similarly Silvertongue is the most familiar with Twilight's power and he respects power. Hence Starlight being his favourite of the Mean 6. But he's interested in all of them and he's glad to have all the members of the Mean 6 as they're all useful. read a couple more chapters before letting that bother you.

<p></p>Sometimes I'll dream about the house I lived in until I was nine.  Often,  it will be better than it actually was. One time,  it was an enormous white castle,  towering into the sky.

            I guess I can see that.  Looking at my own list,  some of my own episodes are either kind of dumb (Discord starting a Disco dance hall) or else way too dark (Pumpkin Cake being a victim of SIDS).
<p></p>So I guess I'll just post my "Best Three, " the ones I would actually like to see (or perhaps write as a fanfic):
<p></p><em>Episode 2 - Romantic Blues</em> <br>Pinkie Pie visits a fortune teller who gives her a vision of her future husband.  Rather than being happy,  Pinkie realizes she's still too immature for such a thing and starts avoiding men to prevent the prophecy from coming true... and then the man from the vision appears.
<p></p><em>Episode 10 - Applejack the Unicorn</em> <br>Just what it sounds like:  one day,  Applejack grows a horn.  How will she adapt to her newfound magical powers?
<p></p>(Elsewhere in the list I had a story about Derpy body-switching with one of the mane cast... perhaps the two premises could be combined?)
<p></p><em>Episode 12 - A Child in Bloom</em> <br>This episode takes place years in the future.  As a foal,  Apple Bloom was put in an arranged marriage with a colt from another farm.  Now she's of age and the colt has come to complete the bargain.  But Apple Bloom is in love with somebody else.  The twist is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she averts the Hollywood Ending and goes with the arranged marriage,  which turns out to be the right move because she later learns that her "true love" was a drunken alcoholic with schizophrenia</span>
<p></p>.... You're all probably glad I don't write for the show,  aren't you?

<p></p>My first instinct is to say Twilight Sparkle,  because I think I would enjoy talking to her,  teaching her about video games and Chinese literature,  maybe she could even help me learn a foreign language or two.
<p></p>But the problem is,  it would pretty much be her and me all day.
<p></p>So my second instinct is Pinkie Pie,  because while she isn't as useful to me personally,  a lot of my friends and family members are Pinkie fans and she would probably do a lot to brighten their day,  and I'd still get to have fun.  Who knows,  she might actually be good at <em>Contra</em>.
