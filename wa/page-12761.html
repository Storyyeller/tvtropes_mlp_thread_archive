            I don't mind AJ being an orphan either.  My only gripe with the concept as a whole is that people often use it as an excuse to insert a bunch of angst when in canon the characters are perfectly well-adjusted. And that's not really an issue with the show itself.

Yeah.
<p></p>I'm actually imagining some sort of <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunnerkriggCourt" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunnerkriggCourt">Gunnerkrigg Court</a></em> scenario where AJ's parents just left with no explanation whatsoever. Then they come back,  and the Apple family has to deal with their conflicting feelings about it. On the one hoof,  they missed the parents,  but on the other hoof,  they're pissed at the abandonment.
<p></p>But it's one of those plots that would take so long to resolve,  it would probably be better suited to fanfiction than to an actual episode.

            @Kyler: That's pretty much what my headcanon is.  Their parents are dead,  but they've long since come to terms with it (except for maybe Apple Bloom,  who'd be too young to remember them well and as a result isn't as affected),  and if anything it's part of the reason that Big Macintosh and Applejack are both so hard-working.

            @Keg: Yeah,  that's a cool idea,  but I think it's <em>way</em> too dark for the show to handle that way.  People would probably take issue to the show using "<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyAesop" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyAesop">If your parents suck,  disown them</a>" as a message.  I'm not saying that there isn't a place for that sort of message (there are definitely people out there who are better off without their deadbeat parents),  but I don't think that this show is the place for it,  mainly because it's an issue that a kid in the age of the target audience isn't going to find relevant.  Anyone young enough to be in the age range the messages are aimed at is going to be to young to be dealing with that sort of thing.
<p></p>If anything,  I think the best message to go with would be "not all families fit the mom/dad/children pattern,  and that's okay".  Of course,  it would be odd to do that now,  given that Family Appreciation Day already established that Apple Bloom isn't really bothered by a lack of parents.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I like the idea,  but I've always found it really hard to reconcile with the show.  The Apple Family is <em>really</em> tightly knit,  and it feels really weird that <em>none</em> of them would have mentioned that.  Just an off-the-cuff "when Mom and Pop drop in,  yadda yadda yadda",  or in <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SSCS6K" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SSCS6K">SSCS 6 K</a> a "what would mom and dad think about you bettin' the farm?" or something.  It's hit the point that their absence is kinda conspicuous.

            @JT: Oh,  agreed. I mean granted I was actually considering that as a way to <em>start</em> the conflict - they could make up in the end - but it's still <em>waaaaaaay</em> to dark. I was just doing some 'what if' thinking.
<p></p>Aj is capable of some angst,  as we've seen in Last Roundup,  but I don't really think she'd angst over something that's not her fault directly.

            Honestly,  I don't think the episode is actually going to address it.
<p></p>On the other hand,  dead parents would make AJ the pony Batman. Which would be awesome.

            @JT Her breakdown at the end of the episode suggests otherwise,  though. Not to mention that blaming yourself for something is a very common form of angst to begin with.
