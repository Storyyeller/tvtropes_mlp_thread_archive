            @Mio: It's more like,  there was clear tension,  and it would only take a small pebble in the pond to send things spiraling down into a flamewar. Not real arguing,  but a step away from it.

            Okay,  here are the last two of Spike's Cupcakes that I made.
<p></p>I'm considering writing up an article and sending it in to ED or something.  I dunno..
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.genericritter.com/wp-content/gallery/junk/amethyst.jpg?556763455">Amethyst Cupcake<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

<p></p>I need to take another pic of the amethyst one.. that's awful blurry.  I also learned that I could get better piping of the icing if I microwaved it for a few seconds before using it.  I wish I had realized that sooner... the cupcakes would have looked a whole lot nicer :(
<p></p>And with that I'm off to work.  Hopefully the ER will be quiet today and I'll be able to keep up with the thread and contribute to all the nonsense <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

<p></p>A few totally-not-made-up-on-the-spot questions from your friendly neighborhood outdated-data-storage-unit,  because these things weigh on my mind.
<p></p>Does Pinkie Pie huff compressed air?
<p></p>Is it true that Mayor Mare has a special dungeon in her basement,  complete with manacles and manticore?
<p></p>If breast size is the forbidden topic for humans who watch ponies,  what's the forbidden topic for ponies who watch humans?
<p></p>Is Pink(!) Celestia just Celestia on her period?
<p></p>What do Tongan ponies look like?
<p></p>Would Celestia have given that bailout to the banks?
<p></p>Is Twilight's checklist fetish and Luna's tax code fetish sufficient grounds to declare them the perfect couple?
<p></p>How does Applebloom feel knowing that her first niece or nephew being born out of wedlock is her fault?
<p></p>Do you think Cheerilee is faking the pregnancy to try and wheedle money out of the Apple Clan?
<p></p>How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a Fluttershy asked politely?

            @CDRW:
<p></p>Does Pinkie Pie huff compressed air? - no. Laughing gas.
<p></p>Is it true that Mayor Mare has a special dungeon in her basement,  complete with manacles and manticore? - the dungeon is a yes,  but she prefers it called her 'pleasure palace' - she's <em>very</em> good at what she does. She has manacles,  but no manticores.
<p></p>If breast size is the forbidden topic for humans who watch ponies,  what's the forbidden topic for ponies who watch humans? - "wingspan".
<p></p>Is Pink(!) Celestia just Celestia on her period? - Don't bring that up in front of her.
<p></p>What do Tongan ponies look like? - <em>Friendly</em>.
<p></p>Would Celestia have given that bailout to the banks? - No,  because the Equestrian economy is handled by ponies with actual scruples. They don't have an economic crisis.
<p></p>Is Twilight's checklist fetish and Luna's tax code fetish sufficient grounds to declare them the perfect couple? - let's put it this way: Celestia doesn't ask Twilight to help Luna with administration anymore.
<p></p>How does Applebloom feel knowing that her first niece or nephew being born out of wedlock is her fault? - she's ten. She's got no idea what the fuck.
<p></p>Do you think Cheerilee is faking the pregnancy to try and wheedle money out of the Apple Clan? - Don't being that one up either.
<p></p>How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a Fluttershy asked politely? - all of it.

            @CDRW,  in order:
<p></p>She might; I wouldn't put it past her,  but it's more likely that she doesn't.
<p></p>I'm not sure what the manticore's for,  but I think Rarity has the manacle dungeon handled with the Undercarousel (for discerning,  consenting customers only).
<p></p>Hm... either horn size or cutie mark,  I would say. XD
<p></p>Nah,  Pink!Celestia is an abomination unto Equestria.
<p></p>I don't know what Tongan means.
<p></p>She wouldn't have had to,  as pony society doesn't use mortgages of any kind,  let alone subprime mortgages.
<p></p>Only for three days around tax time.  It's a forbidden rendevous.
<p></p>Wedlock's probably not a huge deal in pony society.
<p></p>I doubt she'd fake a pregnancy anyway; Cheerilee seems to down-to-earth for that. =)
<p></p>All of it.

            I'm probably alone on this,  but I actually enjoyed our debates today. There's something about pitting your opinions against someone else's and not only find out why you disagree,  but what led others to reach their own unique conclusions that I find quite fun and enlightening. Of course,  it always straddles the thin line between debate and argument,  so it's not something that's good to do too often.

            <strong>Does Pinkie Pie huff compressed air?</strong>
<p></p>Oh she definitely huffs more than that.
<p></p><strong>Is it true that Mayor Mare has a special dungeon in her basement,  complete with manacles and manticore?</strong>
<p></p>It's her "Special dungeon" Ginger's been trying to get invited down there for months.
<p></p><strong>If breast size is the forbidden topic for humans who watch ponies,  what's the forbidden topic for ponies who watch humans?</strong>
<p></p>Less a forbidden topic and more of a "I personally will end you if you continue that line of topic but I'm sure the rest of you enjoy it"
<p></p><strong>Is Pink(!) Celestia just Celestia on her period?</strong>
<p></p>The bleeding hell is wrong with you?
<p></p><strong>What do Tongan ponies look like?</strong>
<p></p>The bleeding hell is a Tongan?
<p></p><strong>Would Celestia have given that bailout to the banks?</strong>
<p></p>Not if she knew they were evil

<p></p>..... Huminahuminahuminahuminahuminahuminahuminahumina.... I mean... Uh... er... May... be... I'm I have some drawing to do?

<p></p>.... Wait,  what?
<p></p><strong>Do you think Cheerilee is faking the pregnancy to try and wheedle money out of the Apple Clan?</strong>
<p></p>1) <em>What</em> money and 2) <em>What</em> pregnancy? I thought Cheerliee was the only one he didn't get pregnant. Rumor has it he got every lass and Ponyville and Braeburn gravid.
<p></p><strong>How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a Fluttershy asked politely?</strong>
<p></p>All of it because they wouldn't be able to resist her.
