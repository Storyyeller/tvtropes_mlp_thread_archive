            Its Trixie Lulamoon all over again! At least its not <em>just</em> "Skim" thus making it seem like the toyline completely and utterly disregards the show. Ya know,  like they did with Lulamoon :P
<p></p>I'm think why some characters get slightly different names in the toyline may be for copyright or tademark reasons. Maybe they couldn't,  for some reason,  <em>just</em> trademark "Trixie" and so they had to give her a surname in the toyline.

            Well,  Trixie is an actual real life name. From what I've heard,  you can't trademark something if it's too common,  so throwing around surnames or whatever else makes the product more distinctive.

            IMO Season 3 was indeed subpar.  Games Ponies Play was as bad as MMDW,  Spike inexplicably became an utter dumbass to generate drama,  and the season finale was a pacing disaster even worse than It's About Time.
<p></p>But it was nowhere near bad enough to be called seasonal rot.  There were some genuinely awesome episodes in there on par with the other seasons,  awesome enough to flesh out even Rainbow Dash.
<p></p>And Bad Seed wasn't really <em>bad</em> so much as taking the easy way out and making a contrived and oversimplified message even the kids have already heard before and know is BS as often as not — which is hardly unusual for a cartoon,  but I was hoping they'd have the balls to make a more complex and honest statement about something that immediately important to their target audience.

            One Bad Apple is a case of YMMV,  like most of them. Some love it some hate it,  same with ALL the episdoes. The only thing that seems to be agreed on was Sleepless was amazing,  and Spike got derailed for Spike At You Service,  and the fainle should have been two episodes.
<p></p>And that last one,  while agreed on,  how much it doing being so ruins it is again YMMV,  struck me as off the first time,  but just got bette and better each time. There is just to much pure feeling and emotion and heart in it for me not to love it.

<p></p>Directly admitting that sometimes bullies don't have a convenient sob story.
<p></p>We all heard the "bullies are just insecure and need love" spiel when we were kids.  Sometimes it's even true,  and of course being too eager to give comeuppance can easily make you just as bad.  But cartoons are leery of even explicitly acknowledging that sometimes kids really are just assholes in a way they typically have no problem doing for adult characters,  much less making a substantive comment on it that's rather desperately needed by children.
<p></p>I mean,  they even have an angle to do this.  From what little we know of Diamond Tiara,  her family is actually pretty wholesome if oblivious to how much they spoil her,  and yet she's a manipulative sociopathic tyrant that ruthlessly intimidates her entire class into submission for giggles and (unlike Babs) likely fears no retribution from her peers.  We don't know nearly as much about Silver Spoon — they could give her any amount of complexity in between DT and Babs including either extreme.
<p></p>The problem is they don't even address it.  When a kid tries to use the message they give instead on the wrong person,  it backfires horribly,  makes them a permanent target,  and makes them feel inadequate for their attempt at friendship not working to boot.
<p></p>That,  and the big moment of retribution when Babs turns on them is in hindsight a hypocritical rejection of the moral they just got done saying,  so it's not even a self-consistent cliche.

If anything,  they could've delivered that message even more powerfully with an unsympathetic bully.
<p></p>Babs's entire narrative purpose was to turn into an antagonist when bullied and back when loved.  She serves a very specific message that good people can be intimidated into doing bad things — and <em>can't</em> deliver the more important one of what to do when they're <em>not</em> intimidated into it.

I guess that particular story was just not something that I was personally expecting or that I thought was even necessary. I just considered the particular events that were happening in the story and I felt that the way it happened was fine,  even good.
<p></p>As you already know,  they have done the moral that you said (even written by the same writer),  so I guess you could argue that they didn't really want to retread that story again. And personally I don't think the fact that the characters in one story are older and the others are younger really change the situation since the target audience is meant to relate to both of them.

            @Pykrete: They didn't do it that way because they've already had "jerk for the sake of being a jerk" characters.  Also,  just because the episode didn't do the plot you wanted them to do doesn't mean that the one they <em>did</em> do is bad.  What happened may not have been what you would have done,  but there's nothing <em>wrong</em> or inconsistent about what happened in that episode.
<p></p>And I basically think S3 has roughly the same average quality level as the first two seasons.  Although I think it's morel like season one in that it had a more overall consistent level of quality,  but it's top episodes weren't as good as S2.  Like I think the average S3 episode is better than the average S2 episode,  but S3 only had like two episodes that really blew me away qualitywise (Magic Duel and Wonderbolt Academy),  whereas S2 had like half a dozen of those episodes.

<p></p>Yes.  Adults.  Who aren't in the peer group their target audience associates with on a regular basis.
<p></p>Cartoons are very leery of admitting that kids are capable of same,  and completely averse to focusing on it for any length of time as anything more than a vehicle for a thematically unrelated plot (DT is being a crazy J. Jonah Jameson and CMC have to be investigators).
