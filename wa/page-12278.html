            I learnt to deal with it. Like Pinkie,  I developed a kind of stealth/ninjitsu ability to sneak around and away undetected,  and used it to slip past bullies I couldn't handle.

            We should all be so lucky. I got picked on in High School. I guess it's wasn't so bad in retrospect,  but it still kinda sucked being the quiet awkward kid.

            I was fortunate enough to combine being not interesting enough to bully with being too smart to bully,  at least in the eyes of bullies.  Actively not giving a single fuck what others thought helped as well.

            While I had been bullied during elementary and middle school,  but once I reached high school,  people tended to let me be.  They'd tease me occasionally,  but it was usually gentle ribbing and very rarely was it  malicious.  I was actually quite liked despite being more than a little weird.

            In my case,  the most prominent bully got kicked out of the school after a while,  and the rest mellowed out,  which I assume happened because ours was a relatively small class,  and the staff stepped in when it got too far.
<p></p>Oddly,  I met the aforementioned prominent bully later,  and she had become a much better person after so many years.

<p></p>Pretty much what it was like for me. I didn't have many particularly bad things happen to me,  but still.
<p></p>Oh yeah,  @Mousa: I explained why I ship Twimac. I saw him take her doll. I thought,  "Why does he want it? Is it because it's hers? Does he have a shrine dedictaed to her or something? Wait! He licked her once! He loves her! That's so sweet! I hope they manage to work things out."

            In my case,  I cannot say that I ever was really bullied. In elementary school I've been in a few scuffles,  sure,  but that was nothing dramatic or unexpected.
<p></p>Later,  I tended to keep to myself,  in hindsight perhaps rather too much,  and there was no shortage of people who did not care terribly about me. But to be fair,  I did not care terribly about <em>them</em> either,  and under some aspects I was not an easy person to get along with (seriously,  I was kind of <em>intolerable</em> at times).

            I was bullied when I was younger,  but it was helped out by a combination of my bully being expelled in the later years of middle school and several growth spurts putting me at a size that people didn't want to bother with after that(And trimming me out a bit,  which helped considerably). Then the wits came in,  sealing off any other avenues. And then the charm... and by the end of high school I was generally well-liked,  actually.
<p></p>Still,  I can't deny that,  tame as they were,  those early years did leave something of an... impression. Not nearly so tender as for some,  but still there.

            I was bullied all throughout school.  It finally tapered off at around my junior/senior year of high school.  It's the reason I tend to keep to myself and not really say very much.

            I've had trouble in the past,  but I always fought back,  and when that didn't work,  I simply told my older brother.
<p></p>The one time I did tell a teacher,  it didn't work,  because the teacher I told had something against me,  so she dismissed it as harmless. At the time,  I translated that to: "The school can't help you. You can only help yourself."

            I'm thinking that Babs is a genuine,  not played for laughs,  medically accurate sociopath.
<p></p>Then again,  I think most bullies are like that. It's the only way I have found to explain some of their actions.
