            @CDRW: You can't send someone an avatar unless they go to their forum settings and enable it.   A while back there were issues with people getting spammed with avatars they didn't want,  so they made it optional.

            I was watching the G3 Runaway Rainbow movie today and I noticed some interesting parallels and comparisons to the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a> version of the series.  First of all,  maybe because that specific movie has a main character named Rarity in it,  I kept having to remind myself to not get her confused with Rainbow Dash because G3 Rainbow Dash not only acts a lot like G4 Rarity,  but they even have almost the same accent (not quite the same,  but very similar).  And G3 Rarity acts more similar to G4 Rainbow Dash in that they both like to have adventures and can be kind of irresponsible sometimes,  and she also has some similar traits to G4 Pinkie.  In fact,  she even looks like a cross between G4 Pinkie and Rainbow Dash,  since she has a pink body like Pinkie but a rainbow-colored mane.
<p></p>Also,  an interesting parallel between G3 Rainbow Dash and G4 Rarity is that G3 Dash went on the expedition to help Rarity find her home again,  but like G4 Rarity,  she packed a LOT of luggage in a cart and she wasn't the one who pulled the cart.  In this case,  it was G3 Spike who pulled it,  which mirrors G4 Spike's role as often being eager to do chores and manual labor to assist Rarity,  who he loves.

            Have any of you ever suffered a severe overexcercizing injury? I'm trying to describe in my story what Fluttershy's wings feel like after flying further than her body had endurance to withstand. The only personal comparison I have is when I tried javelin throwing in high school and threw it so many times that I couldn't open my hand more than halfway for a week afterwards.

            I saw someone bring up the topic of Windigos on the last page,  and something about them capturing Twilight because Celestia hated her at the end of the first part of the S2 finale {whut}. This makes me want to bring up my personal headcanon when it comes to windigos.
<p></p>I think that after about several centuaries of peace and harmony and whatnot,  all of the windigos are pretty much dead. I mean,  they feed off of hate and we saw how badly stuff like friendship literally burns them. So I don't think that it would be possible for them to come back,  even if a full-blown war occurs in Equestria {Which it won't,  I'm just saying if it did}. I mean think about it: If they could actually come back just from the mere presence of hatetread,  wouldn't they have shown up when,  for example,  Discord was freed from his stone prison by the mane 6 and RD pretty much hated him even more then the rest of the mane 6 {Fluttershy aside}?
