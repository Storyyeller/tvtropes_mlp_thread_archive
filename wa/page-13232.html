            @Blue The omnipotent don't exactly need lackeys. And no,  Fluttershy wasn't sucking up. She legitimately thought that Discord could change,  and knew the only possible way would be to allow him to experience real friendship. She was acting like his friend because she <em>wanted</em> to be his friend.

            Fluttershy's honesty is almost on a par with Applejack's.  Therefore,  I believe she really <em>did</em> want to be Discord's friend.

            Yeah,  Fluttershy struck me as more "give him the benefit of the doubt and treat him as a friend,  even if he initially takes advantage of it".  I'm pretty sure she knew that he was initially taking advantage of her kindness,  but ultimately the fact that she was wiling to keep being kind to him despite that is probably one of the factors that made Discord reconsider.  He probably figured that she'd give up on him in short order,  so he might as well take advantage of it.  Then at some point he realized that she was actually trying to be a friend to him rather than just putting on a front in an effort to get something out of him.
<p></p>Granted,  it came to fruition far too quickly,  but I think the basic approach is valid.

<p></p>She said words to that effect at one point,  though I forget what they were.  It was when the others hemmed and hawed about giving her a straight answer.

            Saw the episode. Mostly agree with previous comments,  it's a good episode but a bit clunky in execution and the ending felt rushed. Naturally Discord makes about 90% of the episode.
<p></p>It's kinda the same as Trixie's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel Face Turn</a>,  it's kinda abrupt,  but the execution and poignancy actually makes it work (you wouldn't think Discord had Woobie potential). I kinda feel this would have had more effect if Discord had at least one more antagonist role beforehand however.
<p></p>Minor points for funny animation gags (lol at Discord's bizarre stretching at the start) the Disney references (he does have that whimsical reality warping creature schtick they always use going on),  Angel Bunny getting a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt Monkey</a> role and finally seeing AJ's grouchy side again after a long while. Oh and "Dashie".<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

This.
<p></p>The only gripe I have with the episode is that the character development was too rushed,  but I guess that's the deal with episodic shows in general. You can't really have long overarching storylines. You need to make due with 22 minutes.

            Well,  that was tough sit. I honestly just can't get past how dumb of this premise is right up to the rather unbelievable conclusion.
<p></p>That being said I did find Discord kind of funny,  particularly at the beginning,  but that's about it. I really hope we don't see him again.

            Back from the movie!
<p></p>I see someone put up a video of "Do You Hear the People Sing" after I left... which is ironic,  because despite the fact that it was literally the only song I knew of from the musical,  I... didn't actually care for it that much in the movie itself. I mean,  the moment around it is really well built,  and I gotta say pretty damn awesome,  but I felt like it just kinda got overshadowed by some of the other songs. Fantine's really stood out,  as did everything Javert sang,  ever. My GOD I loved Javert in this movie...
<p></p>So yeah... pones. Actually speaking of pones and music,  last night I fiddled around with my phone for a bit and managed to make an alarm out of the Extended MLP:FIM theme. Hours later,  this line hits me:
<p></p><em>And you all make fun and laughter as easy as Pinkie Pie</em>
<p></p><em>Easy as Pinkie Pie</em>
<p></p>...well.

            Oh goddesses that is,  okay Fluttershy gets so much win for that scene.
<p></p>That,  that really is so touching,  Celstia having that much faith not just in Twilight,  but her freinds to.
<p></p>Though,  LEAVING!? Serisouly? Okay this is really not seeming like he is the level of threat he was in ROH. I can see Celestia doing this,  but,  not being on hoof to help out?
