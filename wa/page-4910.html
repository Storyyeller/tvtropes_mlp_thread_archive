            Anyway,  I'm guessing that it produces more sense when run on the thread as a whole because it has more samples to work with. And it isn't messed up as much by my giant stats posts (maybe I should try to find a way to exclude them from the data).

            As far as shipping goes,  I don't take any of it seriously. I tend to ship based solely on what I think will be good for that particular story.
<p></p>Though I do ship Rarishy,  Pinkie Twi,  and Discolestia fairly consistently. Those are really the only ones,  though. Everything else is always just for ships and giggles.
<p></p>Wait,  what's this random post generator? You've cooked up something to make a post based on a users most common words,  or soemthing?

            I have no idea. It builds a giant tree based on word sequences and then randomly selects words out if it. So there's no easy way to say whether a word came from a specific post,  unless of course it's a word that's only been used once before.

            We really need to save all of these and compile them somewhere.  BTW the one about Cheerilee and Big Mac actually sounds like a totally legit episode.
