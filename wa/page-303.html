            You know Mr.  Richards,  i HAVE been reading these messages you have been sending Anemoi.
<p></p>I appreciate his input on the castle's technical matters.  He has expressed that he is studying in that field,  and I think we could drastically improve the palace's network.
<p></p>Not only that,  he seems to be suffering from a minor nervous breakdown.
<p></p>I believe I should think more of these things through.

<p></p>And I'll let him explain the castle's network when he wakes up.

            @Cheese Well,  there is this band called Sonic Rainboom. Then you have bands like Blazing Saddles,  Thunderbolt 20x,  Equestrian Warriors,  Bravehoof,  Dragonstorm,  Knightmare... there's quite a few!

            Ms.  Dash,  you forgot the Hornbeatles.
<p></p>They were a bit older,  they started the whole rock movement. They were more on the 'soft' side,  before their guitarist,  George Hayisson,  performed a long,  impromptu solo at one of their shows.

            What?  You know how I can get my cutie mark?  Come on,  tell me!  Don't listen to Celestia,  she already has her cutie mark,  she doesn't know what its like to be one of the only fillies that doesn't have one.

            I've heard Twilight sing before. It was... BEAUTIFUL.
<p></p>Scoots,  I may be able to help you. OK,  you said you all performed? Well,  maybe we can plan another performance,  only it'll be 20% cooler if I'm involved! I may even get the other five to help you all out.

<p></p>Let me elaborate on my concerns
<p></p>Let's say for example that you have a real knack for carpet weaving,  your one of the best at it. So you dive into it and get a cutie mark for Carpet weaving but you don't enjoy it. Should you define your life on a skill your good at but don't enjoy? Imagine if Rainbow Dash had a cutiemark for reading books,  do you think she would be happy?
