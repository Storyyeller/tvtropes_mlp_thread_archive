<p></p>@Turnways: Unique doesn't translate to popular in Equestria... or ever,  <em>especially</em> among young kids who haven't had time to develop content filters on what they say to each other.  Even the people of Ponyville,  who are otherwise (reasonably) well-adjusted adults,  all fear Zecora and refuse to interact with her because she's a zebra,  broadly speaking.

            but can people at least understand where I'm coming from? Interpreting "villainous" characters as being irredeemable clashes with the Idealistic tone set by the rest of the series. The mane cast are supposed to be all about the "bringing friendship to people" thing,  that's what the elements were all about. Even a genocidal monster like Nightmare Moon was redeemed,  yet people like Trixie and Gilda are to be denied hapiness just because of a few mistakes they made in their lives? Villains are more interesting if you look at them with a sympathetic eye.
<p></p>I say that I honestly wanted to hug Gilda during her rage at the end.

<p></p>I can't say much about the comparison between griffins and pegasi,  but I do know that there are obvious advantages to being a griffin such as the greater size,  the talons,  and the dexterity,  and hating a griffin for BEING a rare and powerful creature would be like... um...
<p></p>...okay,  it's hard to make a comparison since we don't really HAVE analogous situations in real life... I'll need a few minutes on this one.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">I never said she was irredeemable,  but when you start leather pantsing,  it sounds like you're saying they don't <em>need</em> to be redeemed,  and that's something I definitely can't agree with.  She has no redeeming qualities,  but that's not the same as being irredeemable; that would require there to be no room in her character for redeeming qualities to be <em>introduced</em>.

            @Red Savant. they didn't fear Zecora because she was a zebra,  it was because she lived in a forest that worked on different physical laws then the rest of Equestria.

I'm sorry,  but...So,  because someone is now an adult,  they're no longer allowed to have any insecurities,  any lingering issues? They're not allowed a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> once they grow up?

He talks about how stupid it is that in a world covered in water,  mutants,  specifically people with gills,  are persecuted instead of exulted.
<p></p>Well,  it's like that.  If Equestria is Waterworld,  griffins are pegasi with gills.
<p></p>Alternately,  for Gilda to be hated because she's a rare,  powerful creature would be like hating elves because they're beautiful and expert craftsmen.

            @gingerninja. the whole point of Nightmare Moon/Luna was that she was sympathetic. but she was turned evil against her will. wile not evil,  Gilda's dickishness is her own choice.

            That's actually not canon either.  It's never actually even <em>hinted</em> that she became Nightmare Moon against her will or that there was any outside force involved.  It's just that in the end,  she <em>did</em> show her good qualities,  where both Gilda and Trixie decided to stroke their egos and then run.

            no she wasn't. She was <strong>influenced</strong> by an evil power,  but she was still in control. It even says in the opening that her own bitterness turned her evil for the most part. Plus,  Gilda pranked a few people and stole 1 thing. Luna was attempting <strong>GENOCIDE</strong>
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> and those good qualites only came out after the gang injected her with pure harmony,  stripping her of the evil influence. With Gilda,  You could see it in her face,  she was about to repent,  but her pride and embaressment got in the way. Oh,  and I don't deny the bad things she did,  I just think it's a bit counter-productive to hate characters who exist in a show where redemption and friendships are it's primary themes

            Trixie never even did anything wrong,  she was just doing her job. At least at the start. She got a bit mean later,  but she never really did anything too bad.

            @ kegisak. I just think Gilda and Trixie should have grown up and stopped acting superior at this point in their lives. Tiara and Silver Spoon are just kids and just don't know how not to be little bitches.

            But it's entirely possible that something happened to keep them from 'growing up'. I'm just saying,  we shouldn't judge ponies before knowing their entire story. I'm no psychologist,  but again I say that Trixie feels like an Inferiority complex to me. Gilda could have similar reasons - ponies were afraid of Zecora because she's different. Gilda is likewise different,  but she seems to live among ponies. Is it really so hard to assume that maybe she had to deal with a lot of crap from ponies,  so she got defensive about Dash,  the one pony in flight school who <em>didn't</em> give her shit?
<p></p>Sure,  it's just speculation. But,  canon doesn't say 'they're just dicks' either. It doesn't say <em>anything</em> about them,  aside from that they were mean in their respective episodes.

            Believing they're <em>not</em> responsible for their current behavior requires more assumptions than believing they are and goes against some basic lessons that are among the first things you learn,  if you're from anything like a good family or community,  and remain true throughout your life,  specifically that <em>you are always responsible for not being a dick</em>.
