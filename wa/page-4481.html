            Pinkie would definitely be fun to hang out with... Sort of. Also be annoying very quickly but would still be fun.

            If I were hanging with Pinkie,  I might be tempted to end myself so I wouldn't have to hear her prattle on.  On the other hand,  she is sweet,  and I wouldn't want her to feel responsible for my suicide.

            For the sake of the argument I'll say Twilight,  most likely.  She'd probably be the one that it would be easiest to keep up a conversation with.
<p></p>@Ginger: I think the point AHR is trying to make is that even if you don't want to be a director for the rest of your life,  there are going to be times where you're forced into taking on responsibilities that are outside your comfort zone and area of expertise,  and that the best option is to just soldier on,  do the best you can with what you have,  and try to learn something from the experience.  I.e. in this case,  even if you don't like being a leader,  it's good to have <em>some</em> experience in that capacity so that if you're ever thrust into that position again you'll have at least a bit of experience to work with.

            Ud,  I'm assuming because trying to hold a conversation with Fluttershy would be like pulling teeth.
<p></p>Mousa,  I don't really see RD as a bully.  I was bullied much of my life and Dash at least has some core of decency.  The biggest problem with Dashie is she has absolutely none of the filters we normally use day to day to tell when something is acceptable.

            I'd love to hang out with Twilight,  since I feel she'd be the easiest to relate to (right down to the whole "working on social interaction and making friends" bit...). Fluttershy would probably be second,  since there would likely be little trouble other than her incredible shyness.
<p></p>On a less-pleasant note,  on a trip to the vet today,  I've heard that my dog will probably need to be put down. My older brother took her to PetSmart to take care of apparently-impacted anal glands,  and from what I've heard,  Maya (the dog) has cancer... <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">
