            Okay,  so I've seen this thread turn into multiple diffrent topics,  with the most freuquent being:
<p></p>1: Pony Fantasy 6.
<p></p>2:Charector derailment.
<p></p>3:CRISIS Equestria.
<p></p>4:Fallout Equestria {My personal favorite fanfic}.
<p></p>5{The most annoying one}: Pinkie Pie bashing.
<p></p>6:Tropers trying and usually failing to reccomend something to Ginger.
<p></p>Did I miss anything?<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            Also,  random pony visitations that contain supposed Season Three spoilers,  and an in-depth essay on the political and cultural climate immediately after the end of Flutter Valley.  I think that's everything.

            @Ginger Obnoxious ≠ annoying. Of course,  everyone has a different threshold for when it becomes annoying to them personally (though,  for me at least,  it helps me to sympathize with the characters being annoyed,  like Cranky).

            Speaking of which,  I actually found a tape of old recordings that had episodes of the 1980s MLP,  namely part 4-5 (I think) of <em>The End of Flutter Valley.</em>
<p></p>It's always annoyed me that I never saw how that ended,  but I can't hit up Youtube until later tonight.  Damn Hughesnet bandwidth limits.

            TO be honest I think there are a few ponies in the Mean group that could probably handle Pinkie without trouble.
<p></p>Havocwing = No,  she's too emotionally unstable and would rage just as much as Velvet does
<p></p>Starlight = No,  same problem,  anger management issues
<p></p>Insipid = Yes,  because either a) she wouldn't grasp what was going on in the first place,  or b) she's steal Pinkie's powers and basically the fight is over because Insipid would use the fourth-wall powers to probably erase Pinkie Pie,  Duck Amuck-style.
<p></p>Grayscale = Yes,  she's too calm to be bothered by it,  and as seen in her fight with AJ,  the harder she has to work to win,  the more competent she becomes.
<p></p>Curacao = Unknown. I really have no idea what Curie would even do,  to be honest.

            @Perpetual: I think the issue is that her antics border on the obnoxious even when they aren't supposed to,  and in that case it basically comes down to how much tolerance you have for those antics.  The other thing is that most of the other characters have well-defined characters to the point where even if an episode doesn't focus on them,  they still have substance.  With Pinkie,  whenever she isn't a major part of the plot,  she basically turns into a walking joke.  Now there's nothing wrong with comic relief,  but she ends up in that position so often that unless the episode is about her it's hard to see her as anything else.  Don't get me wrong,  a lot of the time I think that works,  but in some cases her <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> powers get stretched a bit too far and she ends up doing things that none of the other ponies could get away with.

            My problem is simply that I feel NOTHING for her. She doesn't act like a person I can sympathize with,  and feels far too detatched from a normal person most of the time.
<p></p>I personally can't relate to her in any way 80% of the time,  so I end up not caring about any of her conflicts.
