            A great way to show RD's loyalty would be to use Gilda again. She should be ultimately loyal to ALL of her friends (even if their assholes),  not just the Mane 6,  and try to encourage them to change their ways

As for "Rainbow Dash is a lesbian" as allready somepony explain that not fair asuming that tomboy is automaticly gay. I also hate when some fans turn character into gay if there not any on screen evidence for homosexuality.
And show is not sexist to males,  they are all dumb or jerkasses,  see Big Mac,  Silver Star ,  Braburn and Spike. Main character are girls but that not mean that there are not inteligent and nice male secondary character. Also there are dumb and jerkass females.

Just because only female make all awesome stuff this not it bad (most time only male do this) especally if show is popular around adults males. Males in this show are not only plot devices or comic relief.

            The question has come up several times about the characters' ages. I figure the have to be late teens; As shown in "The Ticket Master" Rarity's primary interest in attending the Gala was to take Celestia's nephew as a boyfriend <em>and then marry him</em>.

            The problem with the character's ages is that their social positions and personalities don't really match.  They're mostly living on their own,  and they all have jobs,  so they'd probably be roughly college age by that standard.  But then if you based it solely on personality,  they act a lot younger.  I'm pretty sure the age is ambiguous on purpose.
<p></p>As for the whole "Rainbow Dash is a lesbian" thing,  the issue wasn't really that people thought she was a lesbian,  it was the fact that they were making the assumption that she was based on the rainbow thing and the fact that she was a tomboy; basically they envisioned her as not just a lesbian,  but a lesbian stereotype.  I'm pretty sure Faust said somewhere along the line that making the assumption that RD is a lesbian because she's a tomboy is unfair for both heterosexual tomboys and non-butch lesbians.
<p></p>About shipping: it doesn't bother me too much,  and as an author I actually find it interesting to think of stuff like "what would happen if <em>these</em> characters were a couple".  But when people start getting militant about it or trying to claim their fan pairings as canon,  it's incredibly annoying.
<p></p>Also,  season 2 needs more Big Macintosh,  cause he's awesome.

            Four of the mane cast have jobs: Applejack's a farmer,  Rarity's a fashion designer,  Fluttershy works with animals,  and Dash works in weather control. Dash has graduated school,  as was discussed in "Griffon the Brush-off." Twilight is akin to a college student. I have no idea what Pinkie Pie does. They generally live on their own.

<p></p>Also,  would it be fair to say that Fluttershy is a fully trained veterinarian?  In a Bird In The Hoof,  she eventually broke out the surgical equipment.  I'd like to think that isn't just a gag,  and she really knows what she's doing.
