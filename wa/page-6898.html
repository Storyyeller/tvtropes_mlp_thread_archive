            So,  yet another little thing I noticed about the finale that I keep forgetting to mention. When Twilight does the sad reprise of BBBFF,  you can see her horn glowing. Those dancing dolls aren't part of Twilight's imagination as they would first appear; she's actually conjuring and animating them herself. This means that Chrysalis shattering one by stepping on it was most likely entirely on purpose.

            I've actually been thinking about that. It almost seemed like his headaches only happened when he opposed Chrysalis's will or acted uncharacteristically harsh toward Twilight,  implying that the headaches were in fact caused by his subconscious resistance of her control. No real evidence of this,  but it's a interesting theory.

            my guess would be it was all him,  at that point her "control" was just making him a bit more devoted to her,  if anything.

I have the "playful friends" brushable dolls of all the Mane Six,  Cheerilee and the Cutie Mark Crusaders (I got that set of them) and the set that has Luna and Celestia where Luna has hair but Celestia is all solid plastic for some odd reason (you'd think that if they have a Luna doll with a brushable mane and tail,  they would have the Celestia doll also have that characteristic since I know there were brushable Celestia dolls made).
