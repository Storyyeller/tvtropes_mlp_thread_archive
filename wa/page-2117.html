            I get that,  but I'm more concerned with the fact that she doesn't bother to try and figure out <em>why</em> it works. At the end she just accepts it,  despite spending an entire episode trying to study it. She just seems to decide that it's suddenly alright to take that something happens on faith without ever trying to figure out <em>why</em> it happens. Yeah,  it's not blind faith; she has empirical evidence that it happens. But we also had empirical evidence that lightning happened and we still used to believe that it was because some big many who lived in the sky was angry!
<p></p>If science didn't exist <em>at all</em> in this setting,  I wouldn't care. But Twilight treats <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">magic as a set of rules</a>,  as you would physical laws - she treats it as a science. And when she does she's just told,  "Oh,  don't bother trying to learn why. Just accept that it happens.". I can understand,  accept,  and even enjoy a bit of romanticism. But It doesn't hurt the beauty of a sunset to know a little bit about it. I hate the fact that some people seem to think that reason and beauty are incompatible. Even if you know why something amazing happens,  that <em>doesn't make it less amazing</em>,  so I hate when shows just shove aside reason and science in favour of unfiltered romanticism.

            I still think Pinkie Sense is an Earth Pony power.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_down.png" alt="[down]" title="[down]" height="16" width="16"> I counter that I believe it's based on the Earth Pony power to "read the rocks",  which can be expressed as the ability to find rich loamy soil,  or as the ability to feel for gem- or mineral-rich grounds. Thus her Pinkie Sense is based on an ability she honed a lot as a filly on the family Rock Farm. Without using her power to hunt for rocks,  gems,  or minerals of a specific type,  her senses turned towards reading other things.

            For most of the episode,  she wasn't trying to figure out how it <em>works</em>,  she was trying to get data to prove that it was a hoax,  or coincidence.

            I think it's more that the only reason she was examining the Pinkie Sense was to disprove it.  She was interested in studying it only insofar as she could disprove that it was a thing.  Since her entire motivation was "disprove Pinkie",  when it turned out that Pinkie was <em>right</em> she didn't have any reason to keep messing with it.  Of course,  the real reason is simply that there just wasn't enough time to fit that into the episode.  I'd be all for Twilight trying to figure out the mechanism behind Pinkie Sense in another episode,  although I doubt it'll happen because <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">it's funnier that we don't know</a>.

            Also,  why I fully agree that analyzing something doesn't detract from the beauty or merit of it,  I also think that there's a point where you can just throw up your hands and not bother.  I mean,  I wrote <a class="urllink" href="http://japaneseteeth.deviantart.com/gallery/33652203">a bunch of reviews of the show<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that basically focus on overanalyzing it,  but sometimes I just go "Eh,  I'm just going to chill and watch it".
<p></p>EDIT: <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> My fear is that the mechanism will turn out to be "Eh,  it's Pinkie",  which makes sense,  but would be an enormous cop out.

            You might also disagree that water is wet for all I care.
<p></p>There's pretty much <strong>always</strong> a lot of cynicism in antireligious propaganda. Dawkins and Hitchens are especially amazing at both talking about how amazing a materialistic POV on universe is <em>and</em> switching into FUCK YOU RELIGIOUS PEOPLE I WILL DESTROY EVERYTHING YOU LOVE AND HOLD DEAR YOU WILL ROT LIKE A SACK OF WORMS AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU COULD DO HA mode.
<p></p>Trying to understand something is one thing. Pretending that something can't exist just because you don't understand it is another thing,  and I don't want to live on the same planet with people who pretend such kind of logic is true quite frankly.
<p></p>Measuring marigolds is a very real principle. Clouds cease to be any sort of an interesting sight if you look at them as if they were only a bunch of steam and nothing more.
