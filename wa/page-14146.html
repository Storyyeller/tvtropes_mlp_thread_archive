            I'd remember watching some old videos of G1 with my sister who was always big into the show. I winced in a few places,  but thought it was pretty cool over all.
<p></p>About 6 months ago,  I decided to check it out both from curiosity from the huge amount of references over here and my own boredom and depression. I figured if even a girly show could get me to smile,  it was worth a look. Besides,  it would make good snark bate if nothing else.
<p></p>I enjoyed the first few episodes nice enough,  but it wasn't until Griffon the Brush Off when I started to appreciate the character interactions and subvirtions of cliche plots into something entertaining. Then when the show went into full on musical mode with actually well done songs,  there was simply no turning back.

            It was May of 2011,  I think.  I'd heard good things about FIM.  The Hub was having a Mare-athon,  so I decided to check it out.  I caught the very end of <em>Stare Master</em>,  then watched <em>Winter Wrap Up</em> in full.  I thought it was well-written,  and that song was damn catchy.  I forget what other Season 1 episodes I watched before I had to leave for a doctor's appointment,  but I was hooked.
<p></p>I started taping the episodes on VHS (<a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTube" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTube">YouTube</a> was out of the question at the time),  and eventually acquired all of Season 1.  I discovered this forum in October of 2011,  and have made some good friends here. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">

            I also used to watch G1 occasionally with my sister,  and I remember actually sort of liking it,  though I'd never have admitted that back then.  Hadn't thought about it in years when all the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a> hype started up.

            I saw a bunch of references to the show all over the wiki and elsewhere on the web,  but didn't think the show was really for me. I ended up checking out a few fanworks because they were connected to other series I was following (like I watched <em>Camaraderie Is Supernatural</em> because it originated as an April Fools' Day joke from the makers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonicF" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonicF">Sonic F</a></em>; I read <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Hoofstuck" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Hoofstuck">Hoofstuck</a></em> because I was a fan of <em>Homestuck</em>).
<p></p>Last spring,  a brony pal of mine from started reading <em>Homestuck</em>. I figured since he was giving my obsession a try,  I should check out his obsession. I watched the season one opener on youtube. At the time,  I thought it was a little on the cheesy side,  but it had enough humor and self-awareness to keep me entertained anyway. I'd also been told beforehand that the series took a few episodes to really hit its stride,  so I decide to watch a few more episodes,  to give it a proper chance to win me over.
<p></p>I don't recall any specific moment where I realized that I loved the show,  but I think I reached "I must watch ALL THE EPISODES" levels by the end of "Bridle Gossip".

<p></p>Yep. I was actually surprised how much I liked it,  since music and romance figured so prominently,  two things I'm not much into. My favorite part was the Vegan Police. Also,  anyone know the music that played during the second dream (the one in the hallway)? It sounds familiar but I can't place it. Zelda maybe?

Let me tell you something: there's a very simple explanation for why I'm still alive in a timeline where I shouldn't be. It doesn't involve time travel,  or split timelines,  or alternate universes (unless you tilt your head and squint,  I suppose),  or wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey ANYTHING. It involves something far bigger than the shenanigans you normally get involved in. So big that,  should I share this very simple explanation with you,  you'll either reject it out of hoof and live in denial for the rest of your infuriatingly long life—or you'll accept it and your brain will curl into the fetal position until your next regeneration.   </span>
