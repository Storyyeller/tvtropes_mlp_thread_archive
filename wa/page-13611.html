            @Kyler: My thoughts exactly.
<p></p>Okay,  headcanon time.  This will probably all be disproved in S4,  but whatever.  Here we go:
<p></p>1. Each race/country has its own magical artifact/set of artifacts linked to it. Equestria has the Elements of Harmony; the Crystal Empire has the Crystal Heart.
<p></p>2. Said artifact is linked to the line of succession in each kingdom. Cadance was identified as rule of the Crystal Empire because the crystal heart is in her cutie mark,  and Luna and Celestia's claim to power was validated through their use of the Elements of Harmony.  When the elements first switched hoofs in the pilot episodes was when Celestia confirmed that Twilight (And possibly the other ponies; it remains to be seen) would eventually become a princess.
<p></p>3. This means that the rulers of Equestria are chosen according to their ability to manifest the elements; a leader who isn't honest,  kind,  loyal,  generous,  and having a sense of humor won't ever be able to sync with the element of magic and trigger the ascension.   The reason Twilight ascended is because she manifests all the elements rather than being tied to a specific one.
<p></p>4. Any member of any pony race can sync with any element,  but each at least one member of each race has to bear an element.  This means that it's possible for a unicorn or EP to be the element of magic.  However,  as alicorns represent all three races,  at least one of each must bear an element.
<p></p>5. Celestia and Luna are special cases in they were somehow already alicorns before syncing with the elements (Celestia says Twilight did what nopony else did).  That's why she and Luna were apparently able to bear the six elements between them; they manifest the traits of all races.  Either they were born alicorns because of their inherent ability to manifest the elements (perhaps the Elements ascended them without them knowing exactly how it happened) or there's some other method.  I haven't quite hammered out those details yet.

            As far as I'm concerned,  the best song in that style would be Pochanotas' "Mine". Followed closely by the instrumental in JJ Abrams's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek">Star Trek</a> movie,  Enterprising Young Men.
<p></p>A very nice theme for a Twilight with <em>reforms</em> on her mind. In fact,  I think one of the reasons Celestia got her to socialize normally,  given her otherwise immense comptence,  is to avoid <a class="urllink" href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2009/09/reason-as-memetic-immune-disorder/">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

As it is,  Twilight's studies are just about finished,  the Mane Six regaining their Marks,  and the culmination of Celestia's plans for Twilight. Of course there was no way it wouldn't get picked up for a fourth season,  but it does make one wonder.

            I agree it felt like the end but hey,  now we're getting an "After the end" sort of story. We saw what most shows would make a natural conclusion,  now we're actually finding out what happens after that!

            Saw episode. Maybe it's just my dislike for musicals,  but I feel it would have worked a <em>lot</em> better without them. Like Crystal Empire,  they lag things down and only one or two really progress the plot. Celestia singing Twilight's change I feel actually ruined the dramatic mood and build up.
<p></p>It was okay considering,  but still <em>another</em> S3 episode marred by pacing,  for both the main plot and the revelation.
<p></p>Oh,  and expecting fan rage with perfectly flying Twilight.
