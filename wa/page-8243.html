            @ginger Well,  there was a toyline pony who apparently comes from the Crystal Kingdom,  and we started theorizing what it was like. Blue crystals turn you into a golem,  red ones makes you into a statue slowly,  green ones are added for personal enhancement (wings,  etc.) and pink ones make you a statue instantaneously. The leaders are pink golems,  and blue golems are laborers. Red is mined for energy by the poor.
<p></p>What do you guys think about their geography? I'd imagine it's very mountainous.

            @ginger Orange is one of the only colors left,  so that could work.
<p></p>The mountains are mostly indigo (useless),  with large deposits of red. Blue is a bit rarer,  and orange is found on the tops of mountains. Pink,  green,  and purple are made in labs.

            @ginger I think golems aren't sapient at all. Even if they are,  they can't talk. You could make a different kind with yellow,  if you want sapient golems. Anyone can change this stuff if they want,  I'm just compiling and suggesting stuff.

            @ginger The leaders are golems,  so I guess there are sapient golems. I don't know why they'd want to make more,  since they'd just get overthrown by the new ones.
<p></p>@Berry Crystal Kingdom is a toyline thing,  and we're making fanon about it.
