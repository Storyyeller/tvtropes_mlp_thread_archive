            I sure am hungry.
<p></p>Say,  it would be very inconsiderate to say "I am so hungry I could eat a horse" in Equestria,  wouldn't it be?
<p></p>That reminds me; does Equestria have any <em>horse</em>? There are plenty of equines and ponies,  but what about actual horses?

            Terran ponies are indeed just horses with a certain maximum height at the withers. Who knows if the show will decide to make any kind of distinction?
<p></p>As far as the harassment goes,  it's typical of any fandom. I've seen far,  far smaller works get angry e-mails from people who think their vision of the work is the one true way to do it.

<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Dear Thread Manor...
<p></p>It's been so long since I've written! I'm so sorry! But for a while,  I just kind of stopped reading pony fics,  and no new fics means no new fanfic reports...
<p></p>You may be wondering why it is I stopped reading,  and the reason is,  I started writing instead! I created a whole ton of headcannon on changelings,  and now have a fanfic of my own! You should all totally check out <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/87718/a-novel-tale">A Novel Tale<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>! Follow Twilight as she learns all about how changelings live and operate!
<p></p>But enough about me. I wouldn't have made this if I didn't have some new fics to report on! Today,  I've got a crossover,  a pony on earth fic,  and two slice of life stories!
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24174/mass-effect-continuum">Mass Effect: Continuum<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> -in progress. Shepard and Anderson thought themselves dead when the Crucible activated. Imagine their surprise then,  when they wake up to find themselves on a strangely Earth like world,  with Anderson still himself but Shepard as some kind of equine creature. Did the Crucible work? How did they end up here? How was Shepard changed? Cut off from all support and with only each other,  this is going to be one of the hardest missions they've had to face yet...
<p></p>This is notable for a few reasons. First,  it's femshep. second,  this story has a slightly renegade PTSD Shepard,  which makes for some amusing situations. and it's nice to see some Shepard/Anderson interaction as well,  even if one is still a human and the other is a pony.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/84406/a-twilight-landing">A Twilight Landing<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> -in progress. Jo is up late one night,  watching a particularly violent storm. She is taken of guard,  however,  when the storm starts displaying some very strange behavior,  culminating in a massive shock wave on par with a small earthquake that leaves her house is disarray. Upon investigating the damage done,  she finds a mysterious,  naked woman with blue and purple hair who clearly isn't in her right mind. Jo has always been something of a thrill seeker,  but this takes the cake on strange and new experiences...
<p></p>I like this because a) it's a humanized pony on earth,  something you really don't see enough of,  and b) Twilight has some major PTSD over the whole suddenly being a different species thing. It's still early on,  but I am eager to see where this story goes.

Twilight has always had some slight OCD tendencies,  but ever since the changeling attack on Canterlot,  she's gone into full blown organizing mode,  going so far as to invade Rarity's shop to clean up her creativity inducing clutter. What is it that could have possibly set her off like this? Just why is Twilight such an organized pony?
<p></p>A little one shot of 5k words,  there's not much reason not to give it a try. and there's an epic pillowfight,  too.

The CMC,  while trying to get their gold finding cutie marks,  uncover an ancient magical relic and accidentally activate it. Now everypony in Ponyville is stuck with a magic counter over their heads that ticks up every time they tell a lie. Only Celestia can fix it,  but she's stuck in Baltimare for a few days. Surely Ponyville can survive that long with everypony's falsehoods brought to light,  right?
<p></p>It was an enjoyable story,  though honestly,  the moral kind of lost me towards the end.
<p></p>Well,  that's all for today. I'm still no reading nowhere near as much as I used to be,  so i can't say when I might get around to doing another fanfic report,  but I have in fact started reading again!

            On that post about show staff considering quitting.
<p></p>Yeah I'm taking it with a huge handful of salt. The person who's tweet is being used to claim this has,  to my knowledge,  no direct hotline to the DHX staff,  rather his ties are to Hasbro's legal department. Which okay maybe he could learn something,  but only him,  and not someone a lot closer to the actual staff? plus he's done stuff like this before. Made some dire,  grave warnings and hints that make it out like something really really awful is coming or going on behind the scenes that never pans out,  or at least as bad as he made it sound like.
<p></p>Plus going by the reactions I've seen from show staff.. yeah none of them seem to be taking it seriously from what I can tell. Sibsy was joking about how lame some of the "insults" she had received were. M.A Larson has already proved he can deal with it easily after Twilacorn,  Megan was putting a few jokeing tweets up. And the best was Nicole Oliver asking who she had to send to the moon.
<p></p>Yes I'm sure they are getting some much undeserved flak. But they are also getting far far FAR more support from fans. They knew the trolls and haters a very small,  though very loud minority.
<p></p>It reminds me of back when the whole Twilacorn thing blew up and "everyone knew" that the writers and even Lauren were getting harassed endlessly,  and that they were being besieged by people treating them like shit... only for the resulting flood of apologies to them for those acting like that were mostly met with "What are you taking about? No one's done anything like that."

            Wonder how close it would follow to what happened in Anthropology. Lyra nearly has a Blue Screen when she finds out that her burger was meat... then again they ARE eating cafeteria food.. so odds of anything there having ACTUAL meat are pretty low.
