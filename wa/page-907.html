            Aren't cutie marks one of those "pre-destined" things? Your CM is within you from birth,  and only reveals itself when you accept it.
<p></p>Without the help of Ponies who could see the future,  you will ALWAYS follow a strict pre-determined series of events that would bring about the discovery of your Cutie Mark (and it would end up being a self-fulfilling prophecy even if you were given knowledge of the future)
<p></p>That's how I always saw it at least. You are FATED to have a certain cutie mark,  and the world will naturally reveal that to you over time

            ^That may be,  yes,  but no one's being assigned to fulfill a certain role,  I shouldn't think.  Basically,  it's not a <em>bad</em> thing to know what you want to do in life,  because it's what you yourself want to grow old doing.  You can't give yourself a false cutie mark or a mark for something you'll grow tired of in a year.

            The idea that you could get rid of your cutie mark is absurd. It represents your AMBITION in life. Even if you made a conscious effort to act contrary to your cutie mark,  it isn't going to go away,  because you know you're lying to yourself.
<p></p>A cutie mark is literally part of WHO you are. Your identity,  something that makes you completely unique. It's a permanent facet of your soul.
<p></p>I would be interested in a villain powerful enough to brand fillies with Fake Cutie Marks though (In the form of a branding iron maybe),  even if the effect is only temporary

            I'd guess ponies do have midlife crises,  they just get over them faster,  because they have that unshakeable thing to return to - and they <em>know</em> they have it,  which is where ponies differ from humans.

            ^Perhaps,  but it would take special circumstances to cause someone to feel like they'd lost whatever it was their cutie mark embodies.  Since they have one,  they must know what their calling is,  and I can't really think of anything off the top of my head that would change that.

<p></p>We seem to have encountered a little troll turbulence locally. Both the banhammer and the skullfucker have been vigorously applied. A nuclear strike has been called in on his location as well.
<p></p>Thank you for not taking the bait here or in the other thread,  and please holler again if he shows back up with a new name.

<p></p>For some reason I have a feeling that Celestia and Luna INVENTED Cutie Marks in the first place. Think about it: The ponies must've at least adapted to Discord's tyranny after a while,  and even if they weren't happy about him being in charge,  I think ponykind would've acted a lot more chaotic back in the day (since to them,  chaos would be the norm)
<p></p>What would be the best way to introduce order back into Equestria? Give each and every pony a purpose in life,  something they love,  which they can strive towards obtaining in a wholly positive and constructive manner. It's a win-win scenario for everyone involved. Celestia invented a way of focusing her subject's minds in a completely benevolant way.

<p></p>That would require a lot of power.
<p></p>And you know what? I don't think Celestia and Luna are even that powerful. I'm pretty sure that they aren't god empresses,  they're just ponies with horns,  wings,  and larger-then-normal proportions.

            I've always considered male ponies' cutie marks to be macho marks,  because it sounds cooler.

<p></p>And I think it's pretty obvious that no one in Equestria worships her literally.  They give her the respect she's due both as a princess and as a wise and benevolent ruler,  and they're naturally uneasy in her presence (because she's a god-princess),  but there's no religion based around Celestia.

            There is no doubt that Celestia and Luna posses godlike abilities,  but I doubt they invented cutie marks.
<p></p>On that note i always found the concept of CMFIS to be kind of silly. I just think it is really odd how people ascribe such importance to what are ultimately one off gags ("look Twilight,  Pinkie Pie,  Fluttershy are actting crazy and completly different from how they usually do,  isn't that funny?!") that probably won't be followed up on.
