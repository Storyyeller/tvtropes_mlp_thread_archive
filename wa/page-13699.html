            From what I gather her appearance in the Final episode of season 3 was her last Hurrah and she will not be in season 4 at all.
<p></p>Hasbro is a bit hypocritical,  they want her removed from the cartoon yet they realize they can get money from fans making toys of her.  Of course they are going to go the money route.

            @ Turtle,  and were did you hear this? No one in the show has said anything about it. More likely,  keep in mind the timing. Season 3 was being made mid Derpnarock. Odds are the execs overreacted,  had her taken out of the shows being made. but the writers fought,  and won,  to keep her after things cooled down and got her into the finale.
<p></p>As to Season 4,  we'll just have to wait and see.
<p></p>And,  not only the show rating,  but keep in mind the OTHER report a few weeks ago about toy sales last year. That overall toy sales were down across the bored,  and almost the ONLY toy line to actually grow in sales was MLP merchandise,  which went up 50% worldwide. With a few regions seeing triple digit increases.

            I've seen absolutely nothing regarding the official status of Derpy in the show.  Maybe they're done with her,  maybe they just wanted to ease off of her for awhile,  there's no way to really know until season 4 or until we get some sort of official word on that.

<p></p>I believe it to be true.
<p></p>I guess we'll find out S4,  but she was conspicuously absent from a good deal of S3...
<p></p>Its not a huge deal... I just liked her because I had a lazy eye like that when I was a kid,  was clutzy and had to wear an eyepatch to remedy it (thank goodness didn't need surgery). I still have terrible depth perception. It was just nice to see a character that I had something in common with :P

            and no that's already been debunked as false.
<p></p>1. it was released AFTER we already found evidence of Season 4 so that wasn't even a guess
<p></p>2. Obviously they HAVEN'T canned Derpy,  since she is all over the finale
<p></p>3. it is looking more and more like this was NOT a marketing decision from Hasbro,  but something the Writers came up with.
<p></p>Megan's tweet saying it was HER decsion.
<p></p>MA Larson saying the image of Hasbro forcing stuff onto the show to sell toys was wrong and they've been nothing but great t work with. (And when someone made a joke about him being forced to write that,  he replied "Only time that would be true,  is when you see me say how much I love the way Hasbro spoils all the plot details in their promos."
<p></p>And,  oh yeah that interview with Lauren where she flat out said,  Twi becoming Celestia's succesor was her goal for her destiny from day one.
<p></p>Again feels like they thought for some time that season 3 WOULD be the end,  and tried to wrap up Twi's character arc and destiny before the end.

            If they were trying to phase Derpy out,  she probably wouldn't be on so much of the merch.  Color me skeptical,  those rumors aren't really anything that couldn't be reasonably guessed from what we already knew at the time.

            That Reddit post thing was written when all those things were currently in speculation. There were already alicorn Twilight rumors flying around before it cropped up,  and the Derpy thing had already been widely speculated about in the aftermath of Derpygate.  Basically,  somebody took a few plausible rumors,  stated them as fact to troll the fandom and happened to be accurate about parts of it.
<p></p>For me at least,  the fact that Derpy showed up in the finale and <em>is getting an official toy</em> pretty much quashed the last bit of that post.  Derpy obviously wasn't canned completely,  and the idea of being phased out seems quite unlikely when they're introducing a bunch of merch involving her.
<p></p>Also,  M.A. Larson,  who wrote the finale,  explicitly said that Hasbro didn't force anything on to him.  So there's that.

            I think Derpy appearing in the season finale (and the fact the official MLP twitter <em>posted a picture</em> of one of her cameos) is proof that she's not being removed from the show. Like Sera said,  its possible they wanted to lay off on Derpy for Season 3 following Derpygate.
<p></p>In Season 2 they were shoe-horning her into nearly every episode,  a few cases where it didn't even make sense (without saying "lawl <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorWho" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a> shenanigans"). Seriously,  <em>Cranky's snow globe</em>? I'm sure they were just rethinking how they want her portrayed in the show and gave her a break this season.
<p></p>I for one just want Hasbro to give her a name already. Most bronies seemed fine with Doctor Whooves getting the name Time Turner. Her new toy is part of a collection that includes another pony without an official name ("Lyrica",  one of the high society ponies),  so if they do the Chrysalis collection the same way they did the Nightmare Moon collection they'll list the names on the back for all the ponies.
