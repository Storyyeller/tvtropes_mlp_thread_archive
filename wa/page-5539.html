That's a pretty long time to wait to have kids. Unless they only recently got married or something.

            <div class="quoteblock">What has you so upset about the finale,  exactly? </div>
<p></p>Not so much "upset" as just "cautious."  Despite what another poster suggested,  its hard for me to "just have faith in Studio B" lately.
<p></p>When I first read the spoilers,  nothing really stood out to me,  but the more I think about it the more the following gnaws on my mind:
<p></p>1.  Lots of subpar eps lately.
<p></p>2.  It's a two-parter about a wedding... a traditionally "girly" theme in a show that is known for defying "girly" conventions.  It feeds into the feeling I've brought up before that the show is becoming more "standardized."
<p></p>3.  Twi having a brother just out of nowhere,  when its been strongly implied she's an only child.  Not only that,  but he's apparently an important person.  It kinda feels like they're pulling a Negima or Naruto on us<span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>*</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;"> for the unfamiliar,  both stories started off with the assumption that the title characters were gifted-but-otherwise-normal people struggling to reach great heights,  but in both cases later revealed that the heroes were in fact descendants of nobility/legendary heroes and thus greatness runs in the family.  What I'm suggesting here is that it would disappoint—but not necessarily surprise—me if it turned out Twilight Sparkle is actually a goddess or something and her becoming Celestia's student was actually some sort of plan and not just a lucky fluke</div></span>
<p></p>4.  It's a two-parter.  None of the two-parters in this series have been especially great (though its always possible that third time is the charm).

            I can kind of see where you're coming from,  Moe. The main problem is that you're the only person I've seen (aside from maybe Mio) who thinks that almost every recent episode is subpar,  so nobody else is seeing this trend of decline that worries you.

<p></p>My headcanon is always "each episode plays by its own rules, " so I'm usually forgiving of continuity snarls.  Mostly,  continuity only bothers me when it marks an uncomfortable trend (such as what I was saying about Twi's Flanderization a couple of hundred pages back).
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Okay excuse me a second but WHAT.</div>
<p></p>It's called "the track record."  If you put a batter up to plate twice and he strikes out both times,  it's reasonable to expect him to strike out the third.
<p></p>The show has had two 2-parters so far.  "Friendship is Magic" was okay but not great,  mostly brought down by the second half.  And "Return of Harmony"... I don't think this forum would survive if I started on <em>that</em> again.
