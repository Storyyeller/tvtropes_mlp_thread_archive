            @ Ginger if you DO read it,  keep in mind book one was mostly a joke a strip D&D satire,  it isn't till the end of that book that it starts becomeing more plot centric. Might want to start with book 2.

            you don't really miss much,  some early characterization and a few little backstory elements,  but it's not really all that much.
<p></p>At mosty I'd read the starting at the final battle in Book 1 then let it start building.

            Banjo the Clown should be Sir Lintsalot. Rocky can be Giggles. Madame le Flour can be Banjhulu.
<p></p>EDIT: I don't believe that even Celestia and Luna are immortal. They just age 1000 times slower than normal ponies. Similarly,  Cadance,  like other half-alicorns,  ages slower than a normal pony,  but much,  much faster than a full alicorn.
<p></p>EDIT: In which case it becomes like a far less extreme version of an elf marrying a human. Elves are far more willing to marry humans than other elves,  because it's a smaller commitment (and elves think humans are hot).

She MIGHT be immortal,  but she's young at this point.  She was the same age as Twilight Sparkle is currently when she was babysitting Twi as a filly and seems only a few years older at present.  Thankfully,  this would be only her FIRST marriage.

            My view of her is that she's the embodiment of Love,  the same way that Celestia is the embodiment of the Sun,  and Luna the Moon. The main difference is that she is simply young,  and will take a few centuries to reach her full potential.  Besides,  I'd think it'd be crueler to love someone but refuse to be with them just because you will out-live them.

            Oh so that' how they plan to get food in Glyphmark. Though I guess tehy first have to convince merchants to start traveling there. Anway,  I'm now at the beginning of the legendary chapter 37,  so I guess that's as good a place as any to stop for now.
