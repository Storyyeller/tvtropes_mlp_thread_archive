            Tapping the edge of the jar against a corner is supposes to help. It shakes it up,  loosens the lid about. Or so they say.
<p></p>You can also run it under warm water,  but that wasn't exactly an option there.

            ^Ponies have been able to open stuff with their hooves before.  <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WayTooMuchAnalysis" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WayTooMuchAnalysis">If Dash expected to get enough torque on the jar by holding it with her hooves while she bit the cap,  then she should have been able to apply the same amount of torque to the jar AND the cap just as well.</a> =)
<p></p>Anyway,  while those lines were cute,  I just felt embarrassed for Dash.  She can be a bit overbearing,  yes,  but when push comes to shove (like in the pilot),  she's supposed to be better than that - and I say that because she <em>has</em> been,  and <em>will be</em> better than that in the future.  This was just a low point for her overall,  and it's definitely one of the lowest points any of the girls have hit in the series - all the rest of them ("Applebuck Season",  "Lesson Zero",  "Party Of One") were caused by innocent misunderstandings or noble goals.  Dash just ends up looking like - and I've been trying to avoid this phrase,  but it's too applicable - nothing more than an attention whore,  and that makes me feel bad for her.

            The only thing that bothered me about the granny smith scene was that the whole time I though 'seriously? They're doing <em>this</em> gag?'
<p></p>It was just too cliche for even this show to pull off. But aside from that I was okay with it. Granny Smith actually <em>creaks</em> now. That's pretty funny.

            @Savant: Exactly. There's also the fact that in Lesson Zero,  Twilight at least demonstrated some impressive feats,  even if she was completely insane at the time. No matter how you look at it,  bringing Ponyviille to its knees to the point of requiring intervention by Celestia herself is pretty damn impressive. By comparison,  Rainbow Dash is like a junkie trying desperately to get a fix.
<p></p>I also have to agree when it was brought up that Rainbow Dash doesn't even really learn her lesson in a natural way. It's not until they take off the masks and tell her. Until then,  she's just convinced someone came in and stole all her thunder.
<p></p>You know,  I guess <em>that's</em> the problem with Feeling Pinkie Keen,  as much as I loved it: the spotlight character really shouldn't be the jerk of the day. In retrospect,  I didn't really like Look Before You Sleep or Fall Weather Friends for the same reason.

            I've never seen it happen. It seems kind pointless anyway,  if they can get too the street,  why do they need help getting across?
<p></p>Plus,  if they are crossing that street,  they've probably crossed before,  without help.
<p></p>It seems pointless outside a cliche boy/girl scout scene.

            I assume old people only get help when they look like they have a lot of stuff crossing the street or something. But considering how DANGEROUS Ponyville seems to have become I guess you could say RD was safeguarding Granny Smith from randomly getting bowled over by a runaway baby carriage. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_wink.png" height="16" width="16" alt="wink" title="wink">
<p></p>And I guess that was one of the things that bothered me,  it seemed a bit more mean spirited than the usual fare. I half expected RD to Sonic Rainnuke the jar or something though. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            After thinking about it a bit,  I think I've figured out why superheroics + ponies don't really mix.
<p></p>Aside from the elevated tech level,  the problem is that superheroics fundamentally require super-villainy in order to work,  and MLP is too much of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarBowl" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarBowl">Sugar Bowl</a> to support it.  Sure,  super-heroism to stop disasters is good,  but you can only have so many collapsing buildings and runaway wagons before it stretches credibility (why <em>does</em> Ponyville have a road that goes down a hill and leads to a cliff edge?).
<p></p>Yeah yeah yeah,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>,  but it just contributes to the "Ponyville OOC" feel of the episode.

            I don't know... if it hadn't been for the reveal Dash's attention-seeking would've eventually turned pretty nast. Like,  actually <em>casuing</em> disasters in an attempt to save ponies. Dash would have eventually wound up being <em>the villainess</em> to Mare-Do-Well's superheroin.
<p></p>Of course if there wer an AU where this was the case,  I absolutely would not accept it if the Mare-Do-Well was anything but an earth pony,  of course.

<p></p>I have no problem with the moral itself; I just wish RD would have figured it out herself rather than having everypony else basically tell her what she was supposed to learn.
