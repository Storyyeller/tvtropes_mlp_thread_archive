            @Star Swirl: Well I wouldn't say our tech is 'like' magic,  although some of it certainly is. More to the point,  though,  it simply emulates it. If it were 'like' magic it would be fairly small and unobtrusive,  but it is...not. For example we have machines that allow us to fly... but are about a dozen times the size of a person.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">You can walk on clouds,  create lighting and rain with a kick,  and can fly despite being far too heavy to generate <em>any</em> lift. It might not seem like it inside a culture of magic,  but to an outsider it's <em>very</em> clear that you have magic of some sort.

            Well they are,  Orion. It's a natural aptitude for magic. It's in the same way that I mention my ability to Dowse - if you consider dowsing magic,  then we both have an affinity for 'ritual' magic(That is to say,  magic that requires a specific set of actions and/or materials to activate). You activate flight magic by flapping your wings,  while I activate a magic that let's me determine how many and which gender of child a woman has had by holding a gold ring over the wrist of her dominant hand with a bit of string(Okay,  so your ritual is a bit less complicated than mine).
<p></p>The thing is,  neither is a ritual that someone else can learn. It's something you're born with,  and is thus natural. This is what I mean when I claim that magic is really just advanced science - 'magic' is all archaic,  all spirits and malarkey. This is just a natural affinity for something that exists all the time. It's no different from someone who was born with brown hari or blue eyes - you were born with flight,  I was born with dousing. Simple,  really.

<p></p>Just make sure it's the Western Animation version. The comic book was O.k. at first but got worse and worse over time. The show was pretty solid in it's first season but the second blew all expectations away.

            Kegisak is right that such pegasus abilities are a form of magic. Pinkamena Diane Pie,  Bearer of the Element of Laughter has promised to help me convince Rainbow Dash,  Bearer of the Element of Loyalty to let me study her to find out more about this magic.

            @ Ginger re: Dresden Files,  having actually read all but the last book now I can say,  you may like it,  now we all know your major question so....
<p></p>Each individual books villain runs the gamut from simple brute that has just enough power to be a threat,  but not enough skill to really stand a chance,  to grand Chessmaster. But there are many you should love; Nicodemus,  Cowl,  Mavra,  Mab...AND you find out about halfway through the series so far <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> nearly all of the more cannon fodder villains were actually pawns for the real <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the series that has been pulling the strings in the background the entire time,  and still have not been discovered,  harry and his allies know they exist,  but that's it,  they have no idea who they are or what they want.</span>
