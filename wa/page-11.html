            I actually didn't like the episode as much as a lot of others,  but it was still pretty cool.
<p></p>My favourites remain Applebuck Season,  Dragonshy,  Winter Wrap Up,  and Sonic Rainboom.

            Not my favorite episode,  due to the focus on the CMC (whom I simply don't care about as much as the adult cast),  but still enough awesomeness to be enjoyable.
...But I'm getting a bit annoyed at all the crap happening to Twilight. Now,  she's <em>hardly</em> the only character who gets messed up by the world,  so I'm wondering if it's just a flaw in my perception,  but I'm starting to feel like she's turning into the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewToy" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewToy">Chew Toy</a>...Maybe it's just me.

Aside from "Pinkie Keen",  I can't really think of any episodes that have her constantly getting hurt.

            This was no chicken.  This was evil manifest.
<p></p>...Sorry,  it had to be said.
<p></p>Yeah,  I'm kind of ambivalent about the Cutie Mark Crusaders (Aplebloom seems like she's starting to get flatter as a character rather than developing,  and Scootaloo seems... Not really characterized at all.  Sweetie Belle is better,  but still not as interesting as Twilight and her friends.)  But this was as much Fluttershy's episode as theirs,  and I enjoyed her part quite a bit.
<p></p>And as for why Twilight was the one who got petrified?  They needed a way to keep her screen time up.  She <em>is</em> the main character,  after all.  And I don't know if it's you or not... I think Rainbow Dash gets chewed on a teensy bit more,  but I may be mistaken.

<p></p>Scootaloo seems to be the most troublesome of the group.  Sweetie Belle was at least <em>trying</em> to help Rarity.  And Apple Bloom made puppy dog eyes at twilight in the pilot and was nice to Zecora.  Scootaloo... Hasn't really done anything that makes me think of her as anything other than "that orange twerp".
<p></p>They seem to get next week's episode to themselves... Hopefully Scootaloo will develop a personality other than "loud" by then.
<p></p>...Also,  is it just me,  or did Opalescence seem to have gotten a lot meaner since "Suited For Success?"

<p></p>Anyway,  I thought this was one of the weaker ones,  but there was some changes to the standard formula that were nice to see. For example,  I appreciated that they didn't (horse?)shoehorn in a moral with the letter at the end.
<p></p>But I guess there was a moral,  wasn't there? Don't bite off more than you can chew? Isn't that a bit strange considering Fluttershy had no idea it would be difficult,  and both Rarity and Fluttershy managed to succeed in the end?
<p></p>So would the lesson be "don't try new things because it could be hard"?
<p></p>I guess that's being a bit picky. It wasn't so bad,  really.

            I think for the sake of my sanity I'm going to assume the Aesop of this particular episode goes out to the Crusaders rather than to Fluttershy,  and it's "Even if you don't always understand them,  the rules grown-ups make are usually there for a reason."

            Looking at this episode,  there are two main thoughs that I had.
<p></p>1. I had no idea the Sweetie Belle was Rarity's sister.
<p></p>2. If Fluttershy is so scared of the Evergreene forst,  then why does she live so freaking close to it?

            Kinda a pity that Flutershy only revealed her <strong>Stare</strong> this episode,  instead of when it would have helped resolve the plot like with the parasprites. And don't say only oompah music works on parasprites,  she used her <strong>Stare</strong> to win a staring contest with a creature that has a petrifying gaze.
