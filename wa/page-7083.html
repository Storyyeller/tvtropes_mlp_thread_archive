<p></p>I don't think TWO donkeys living there counts as a multi-cultural melting pot. non of the chefs lived in ponyville,  that's just where they caught the train to Canterlot at.

            They are sapeint,  that's all tha matters,  who cares how equine they look. well other then you. I think it's pretty much the antithesis of the very essence of the show to think ponies would hate or reject another just becuase they weren't pony enough (ok 1. Zecora issue was NOT that,  no one except Twi even knew she wasn't a pony. 2. Ok yeah they might be scared at first,  but I'm talking long term,  not first impression)

<p></p>I never said "the ponies should hate or reject" anybody,  don't put words in my mouth.
<p></p>For that matter you can stop equating my stance with racism.  It doesn't work.  I outlined the difference in my last post.  If you seriously can't see the difference,  then I have to ask:  If I told you I was going to marry a doberman,  would that be okay with you?
