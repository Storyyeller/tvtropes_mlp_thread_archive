            What if I don't believe in karma? Like I just said,  isn't it more important that she learned what she did wrong than get punished?

            No,  Ginger,  he's trying to explain his viewpoint,  and I happen to agree with him.  You don't always have to be punished to learn something.  If you had to choose between Pinkie getting punished and learning what she did wrong - if they were mutually exclusive - which would you pick?

            And guess what? Pinkie STILL got what she wanted in the end. Spoiling a child is considered a BAD thing,  right?

            I kind of agree with Ginger on this. Pinkie was being very inconsiderate of Cranky's personable bubble and belongings. Now,  my memory is a bit rusty,  but didn't Cranky give Pinkie a verbal smack down when she destroyed his picture book?

Other characters respond better to punishment and learn better that way perhaps.
