            Guys,  I'm going to Hawaii until the 11th so I won't have much internet access. If anyone can keep a list of great pictures they've found when I'm back,  it will be greatly appreciated.

            By the way,  where does the screenshot in the top right of "I Watch it for the plot" come from? Top left is probably Dog and Pony Show and the bottom is Winter Wrap Up but I can't figure out the last one.

            I can't find a comic I remember seeing on ponibooru now. It had twilight explaining her day and after every panel had her with my avvie picture saying "hit the sauce"
<p></p>She was explaining to a psychiatrist or something I think. Can't remember..

            Well,  it’s not I could have seen it coming. I was spelunking in a local cave (with a safety cable and a helmet of course; I’m not that stupid,  for all the good it did me),  when the hole opened beneath me. I wasn’t too worried; I had a strong cable rope and the cave was shallow,  so it wouldn’t have been a far drop,  regardless.
<p></p>It was.
<p></p>I felt a wave of nausea which was strange,  since I wasn’t expecting a drop of more than couple of feet and found myself hanging by my cable about ten feet or more above what appeared to be flagstones. Clearly this was no normal hole. After a few seconds of getting used to the idea that I'm not anywhere near the cave anymore,  I consider climbing back up the cable and hopefully ending up back where I came from. Then whatever it was I fell through closes,  bites the cable in half and I find the height I’m hanging from rapidly diminishing.
<p></p>For future reference,  if you ever find yourself falling ten feet or so onto flagstones,  pray the impact kills you. In my case it didn’t. I had sense enough to try to fall safely,  and I’m moderately sure it helped me survive the fall,  but it wasn’t really on my mind at the time. I’m one of the “lucky” people to have never broken a bone in their life,  so I was getting a crash course (in the worst sense of the word) in what broken bones feel like.
<p></p>I hit the flagstones,  rolled a few times and my vision went red. The loudest noise I’ve ever heard in my life filled my head; after a few seconds I realized it was me. The last thing I heard before I thankfully lost consciousness was the sound of my heart.
<p></p>Strange how it sounded just like galloping hooves…
<p></p>

<p></p>I must say,  I'm intrigued. I'd be interested in following this.
<p></p>Ever since a thread on Ponychan,  I've been wanting to write a Blue Blood/Trixie story; in which it's a tongue-in-cheek <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarcrossedLovers" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarcrossedLovers">Starcrossed Lovers</a> stories. Trixie and Blue Blood take it completely seriously,  but no one else does.

Easier to work when you can see a character from an outside source than have to write out the character's personalties. I mean,  I'll have to,  to <em>some</em> extent,  but I won't have to be as exact,  since they're not primary characters. Plus this way you can see them as others do.

            More or less it's just going to be a travelogue: the main character isn't going to be involved in anything major,  he's just going to see the sights and meet people. Ponies. Whichever.
