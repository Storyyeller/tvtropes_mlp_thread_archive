            Okay they need to hurry the fuck up and FINISH that damn game,  if only so it can be out,  and DONE,  and beyond the ability of a C&D to stop anything. Once it's released to the public,  it will never die.

            I'm a brony and I'm <em>still</em> perplexed about <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyLittlePonyFightingIsMagic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyLittlePonyFightingIsMagic">Fighting is Magic</a>. Those guys have put in more effort into a Fan Game than it rightfully deserves,  and now it has a chance to be featured on the main stage at Evo? Is that even legal? (Well,  I guess it is or else they wouldn't have put it in the poll,  or maybe someone along the way didn't check their facts...)
<p></p>It makes me wonder if we'll ever see a Triple-A pony title from a major company and what it'd look like. High Moon Studios proved you can make a good Transformers game (two,  even!),  think Hasbro would let them have a crack at ponies?

            Long as they aren't making any money off it,  it should be. And the good news is,  once it's on stage,  it is done,  they said it would be the finished,  fully complete game or nothing,  so at that point,  just leak it to the public,  and BOOM no worry about a C&D being able to stop anything excet adding more ponies,  which you can bet SOMEONE will do.

            Yeah,  this is THE single most wanted thing in the brony community,  it is getting them attention for the show for free from factions they could never hope to reach,  and even some of the show staff have said they are eager for it,  only hope is,  as big as it is,  if they WERE going to shut it down they would have by now. but even then <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MANE6" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MANE6">MANE 6</a> could still just stop promoting it,  stop saying anything. finish it and leak it. once it's out,  there isn't a damn thing they could do to stop it.
<p></p>But yeah shutting it down is probably the single dumbest thing they could do and kill any good will we have.

<p></p>But seriously,  I'm really looking forward to this game. I would hate to see copyright bullshit screw it all up. Like with that one pony RPG game {I don't remember the name} that hasbro had no choice but to shut down. Copyright is a bitch.

            Shutting down any fangame,  no matter how popular,  is not "stupid",  its Hasbro protecting its legal trademarks. If I understand it correctly they actually HAVE to C&D projects that infringe on their trademarks that they are made aware of (I'm sure some of the higher ups at Hasbro are aware of Fighting is Magic,  they're just turning a blind eye for the moment) or they legally lose the trademark. Its why MLP: Online was shut down. Mane 6 has even said that Hasbro could still C&D them and they'd be perfectly alright with that since its Hasbro's trademark.
<p></p>Copyright &amp; Trademark laws are a bitch.

            No,  they would NOT automatically lose their trademark,  but they would lose some ground to fight on should they choose to take another person or thing to court over that trademark. So it's a balancing act.
<p></p>So far they have been very very VERY lenient about doing only the bare minimum they need to,  so far the ONLY things that have been actually told to stop completely,  was MLP Online,  which Given just how MUCH it used MLP stuff,  okay might be a bit to much,  and the one site that used to be up offering free downloads of the eps,  which was up for quite awhile,  and only got told to shut down after they started asking for donations.
<p></p>You tube vids,  they finaly went with the auto take downs,  but that was due to China saying why should they buy the show right when everyone can get it for free. And even then,  far as I can tell they've left season 3 alone.
<p></p>So there's hope,  and again,  the big deal would be once it shows up on the main floor of EVO,  if nothing for that,  don't worry,  and even so,  byt then it will be done,  once it is finished and released,  no C&amp;D can stop it.

            Yeah,  trademark infringement is what you have to watch out for. Luckily,  I don't think this infringes on trademarks so much as the copyright of the show (because,  IIRC,  the title is just Fighting is Magic,  whereas MLP Online had My Little Pony right in the name),  which they are able to enforce at their leisure. If this actually reaches the main stage at EVO,  I'd say that it's an implicit OK from Hasbro as a whole,  given the massive internet coverage that the event gets. Honestly,  given the game's target audience,  it's probably just free advertising.

            Which is probably the thought going on with it. It was already on the floor at the last EVO,  so got out there and yeah,  free advertising,  Hasbro HAS to know that is one of the reasons FIM got so huge was the fact that it is EVERYWHERE!

<p></p>Is that really the name of the tag.

            Actually,  in this case,  it would be kinda dumb of Hasbro to shut it down.
<p></p>you know what would be a better idea? <em>Buy It</em>. Buy the company,  licence the game,  sell it on PSN and XBLA or soemthing. Sure,  it's not their usual merch,  but we see them becoming more and more aware of their peripheral audience. How many people do you think would buy this? Even <em>outside</em> bronies? How many hipsters would buy the MLP fighting game to be 'ironic'?
<p></p>Even the argument that they don't want the fighting image on their title can be circumvented,  and really argued against considering the nature of the show. The girls fight stuff all the time,  to say nothing of the comics.
