            Good night Ginger. And I agree about the plot tumor part. I think if you could condense Twilight into one or two books,  they might actually be interesting/relevant/almost good.

            In the most recent chapter of my fic I skimmed so close to shipping that I actually felt really awkward about it,  even though it wasn't technically shipping at all. Rather,  I used a previously non-existent romantic interest as a display of the more unpleasant side effects of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">Cosmic Retcon</a>,  and it was kept squarely out of the realm of shipping by the fact that the target of said interest remembered things the way they were before the retcon. There were no mutual feelings,  or even mutual acquaintance for that matter. I think it worked out really well,  but I was actually quite worried about it when I wrote it,  because it came <em>really</em> close to crossing a line I didn't want to cross.

            Well,  I'm glad to hear that you were okay.
<p></p>As for the town hall,  it gets banged around a lot,  but I don't think it's ever been completely destroyed.  It's kind of miraculous that it's still standing.

<p></p>But that isn't really the same because he added a Mary Sue and changed it to the Elements of Science. I don't think it was meant to seriously represent MLP. It's more of a dig on scientific publishing practices.

            Yep. But given the way the plot is moving,  it's likely to only last one year anyway.

            @Lyra: Still,  you'd think that we'd learn of this by now. I mean,  we learn about the filly lives of the mane 6 and what the fashion was like when Cheerilee was young. I'd figure the pirate raid would be important to know.

            meh,  it was never close to shipping,  it was just a pony that liked to flirt with RD who RD had no interest in,  seemed like RD had figured even if her memories had changed to reflect reality,  she would still no have been interested.
<p></p>Really it gets out of hand when any hint and romance in a story instanly turns it into shipping. far as i'm concerned,  Shipping is only when a major part of the story is about the relationship.
<p></p>hell the whole fascination with shipping just boggles me,  who cares..i mean I know many do but,  why? you like one pairing,  ok read/write those stories,  but..ARGHH just iritates me,  it's all so stupid this whle concern about the damn thing.
