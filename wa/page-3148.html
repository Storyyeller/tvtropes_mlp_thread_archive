<p></p>The moral for this one seems fairly obvious,  but I'm still looking forward to how it's pulled off. Could be interesting.

            Ouch. Best of luck to you and your sister,  Ginger.
<p></p>Anyways,  new synopsis? It sounds like the episode has potential,  if the writers can pull it off. Also gonna agree with kegi and Freeman here,  there's probably going to be a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PornStash" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PornStash">Porn Stash</a> analogy.

            We've also got Big Mac playing a presumably major part. So if we get a body swap episode(unlikely),  learn more about Zecora(maybe,  she's been sorta prominent),  or Trollestia strikes(read: Celestia is featured in an episode),  we've got a Bingo!

            What about a new species of pony? Then we'd have a diagonal.

            Let's see... 'Another flashback episode',  'Sweetie Belle episode without the Crusaders',  'episode without Twilight Sparkle',  'another member of the Apple family appears',  'Another episode about Spike and Rarity',  'the Mane cast's parents make an appearance in the present',  and 'Derpy talks'.
<p></p>Hm... I definitely wonder if 'reading' was what the creators intended by 'Dash's little secret'.  I do wnat to see most of these,  though...

            Okay,  let's see what I missed at work this time...
<p></p>Derpy thing: I really hope the fandom doesn't do something stupid.  It just bugs me that the team went to so much work to do something nice for the fandom only for a bunch of people to complain.  It seems really ungrateful.  Not to mention that I don't think I've ever actually seen the word "Derp" used as a slur against the mentally challenged; I almost always see it in the context of regular garden variety mistakes.  Like "Oops,  I wrote 'there' instead of 'their'. Derp."  Not to mention that assuming Derpy is retarded based solely on her voice and her clumsiness is totally unfair.  I still don't see any reason to see her as anything but a fully functional pony who's a klutz that may or may not have a speech impediment.
<p></p>Read It and Weep: Sounds awesome.  Hopefully Twilight shows up.  And I await the inevitable puns on the titles of classic literature.
<p></p>@Ginger: Hope your sister is okay.

            That's a good question.  If you're going to juggle,  don't start with knives. Even if she had experience juggling,  if trying to advance to knives,  perhaps she should have used prop knives? Thankfully,  the most serious injury I had with a blade was slicing the tip of my finger off with a paper cutter several years ago.
