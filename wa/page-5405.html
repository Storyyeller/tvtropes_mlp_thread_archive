            @ J Teeth all he read was the intial one sentance preview,  which dind't even mention the tornado at all,  and then was upset that the tornado only appeared at the end instead of the entire episode being about them making it or something....I really did not understand

            @Seraphem: Yeah,  I don't really get that either.  I mean,  it's certainly an important aspect of the episode,  but there was never any indication that all the action in the episode would center around it.

            Damn,  that DVD set is in PAL format,  so I can't even import it.

<p></p>I think Spitfire was just there as an official overseer since,  as Fluttershy mentions,  this was basically a performance of sorts. I'm guessing that she'll probably act as emergency backup (and call in Equestria reinforcements if needed) if it turns out that the Ponyville pegasi are unable to create the waterspout on their own.
<p></p>And yeah,  I think this was my favorite episode of the season overall.

<p></p>As for Rainbow Dash,  as said I think it's a case of balance. I don't think these kind of gentler roles would work for her all time,  nor would her jerkass ones. We just need a well moderated mix of both roles to make her likeable as well as hilariously flawed and abrasive. I may take back my previous concern of her being Flanderized a bit in the second season now.

<p></p>Ooh~ yeah. I agree. Spitfire <em>is</em> rather generic,  even compared to the other Wonderbolts (Hi Soarin')
<p></p>Maybe she's supposed to be <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardizedLeader" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardizedLeader">the team's Cyclops</a>? :p

            Okay here's all the posts I tried to post earlier.I just finished watching the episode. Reactions:
<p></p><ul><li>Derpy!
</li><li>Wow,  that tree thing has to be intentional
</li><li>Does Pegasus!Whooves have a different cutie mark?
</li></ul><p></p><div class="quoteblock">I do like how quickly dismissed the record though,  I would have expected her to be more upset. </div>
<p></p>Yeah,  I thought that was a nice moment too. Actually,  I kept expecting RD to put them all in danger,  and then Fluttershy becomes a superpoewrful flyer to save them.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Anyone notice that Hurricane Fluttershy was pretty much like Sonic Rainboom with the roles inverted? </div>
<p></p>I actually thought about that at the moment when Fluttershy talked about moral support. I half expected a [[small:yay]] callback.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I was expecting them to make the tornado early on only for it to go out of control. I was expecting it to play a larger role than it did. </div>
<p></p>Personally I like it when the plot isn't completely what I expected. That's one of the reasons I liked Sweet and Elite so much.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I'm sure most troper wouldn't want to hear you say the same thing over and over again,  Chariot. </div>
<p></p>Yeah,  tat's Ginger's job,  silly!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Why were they expecting foals to help with it? That seems kind of dangerous. </div>
<p></p>Well for one thing,  they had Spitfire on hand to make sure things were safe. Also,  ponies are <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>. In case you didn't notice,  Rainbwo Dash crashed headfirst through a solid tree trunk and was unharmed. Which does raise the question of what exactly it took to hurt her in Read It And Weep.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">They're not in Applebloom's class anymore are they?</div>
<p></p>I don't think they were in Call Of The Cutie either. IIRC,  they've only been together in the talent show (presuambly school wide),  and the class field trip (this one's hard to explain,  since it isn't comprised of any class we've seen.)
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">The weather team still didn't have the birds </div>
<p></p>Or the ice.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">But you're right,  HD is only necessary when I grab a file for my TV. a 22" monitor is small enough for 480. </div>
<p></p>Well I think the difference is noticeable on a laptop screen. I remember one time watching a video of Braid,  and at 480p,  the paintings in the house were all blurry,  but the they were clearly visible at 720p.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I thought I was the only one who read that as Candlej </div>
<p></p>Oh,  you mean Candlejack? You know,  you should set your post using a script so he won't catch you. Muhahahaha!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">yeah only thing that kinda bugged my this ep was the Writers Cannot Do Math bit </div>
<p></p>Or they could do math,  and RD was just wildy overoptimistic.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">We mostly post at the same time and not read each other. </div>
<p></p>I find this a bit ironic since I'm currently catching up with the thread and hence not actually reading anything.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">anyone else get the feeling that Twi's little zip your mouth motion was a combo call-back/threat to how she literaly turned his lips into a zipper and shut them in Boast Busters? </div>
<p></p>I noticed that too.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Gods. First a clip on Monday,  and now a clip on Saturday. Alright,  fine. I'll take a look at these. </div>
<p></p>I thought that last week's preview was also on Saturday.
