            Dear Princess Celestia, 
<p></p>Today I learned that I can get things done much faster if I do them in a musical montage.  Truely there is no force in Equestria more powerful.

            @Blue: The problem there is that she literally only spends about ten minutes searching for a solution before finding it.  There wasn't much tension because she figures out how to solve the problem almost immediately after it manifests. That,  and once she gets the swap to work on Fluttershy,  it's just "rinse and repeat" from there.  She never really has any difficulty.  Compare it to,  say,  Return of Harmony pt.2,  where she spends a good chunk of time dealing with the fallout.
<p></p>Also,  the elements were only stolen once; the other time was Chrysalis prevents the ponies from ever getting to them.

            @Kyler: Yeah,  basically it just shows each pony sucking at their job,  then getting fixed. I wanted to get stuff like Fluttershy feeling like an outcast because of her terrible parties,  or Applejack having to deal with the fact that she can't contribute anything to the town,  or see the Apple Family trying to put up with Pinkie Pie.  I wanted to see how the switch would affect everyone beyond "okay,  they're bad at this". The only one that really did that was Rarity sucking at weather.

            If it had been a two parter they could stretch out the time between twi moping and discovering the solution.  Maybe have her make a few attempts at solving things that don't work,  and have the town fall apart a bit more gradually.

            @Handle Considering that the spell required the Elements of Harmony to function,  I wouldn't call it inexpensive or easy. I still don't see how that's a plot hole that ruins the whole plot,  though,  or even a plot hole at all.
<p></p>@Irish Wait... The Element of Magic was on Twilight head when she disappeared,  but it wasn't there when it returned...

            My headcanon is that the elements help determine the Equestrian line of succession.
<p></p>@Handle: It's hardly a cheap,  easy spell,  given that it was written by Star Swirl,  who's been implied on multiple occasions to be <em>the</em> wizard pony in Equestrian history and it requires the elements to work.  That and while the spell took effect rather easily,  it was also <em>resolved</em> rather easily.  There's no aspect of the spell that doesn't really fit in the canon.
