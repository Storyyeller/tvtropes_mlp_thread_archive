            That's assuming that she's now immortal,  though.  I personally headcanon that Celestia and Luna are the only immortals in the show,  while Cadence and Twilight will likely have a normal or slightly extended lifespan.

            And the only way we'll get hard evidence either way would be for the show or someone working on it to address the issue,  which I don't see happening for a while.  Until then,  I'm content with believing that Twilight and Cadence have normal or semi-normal lifespans.

            We do already have evidence that they will continue to grow with age,  considering that Cadance is by far the tallest mare in the show outside of Celestia and Luna,  and Twilight herself gained a few inches when she got her wings. That lends to them being more similar to Celestia/Luna than dissimilar.

            <div class="quoteblock">Book of Sand?</div>
A short story by Jorge Luis Borges. It's about a book with far more pages than its binding should be able to hold—a theoretically infinite number of pages. It's impossible navigate because the pages are in random order,  and they seem to change every time you turn a page,  and it's impossible to turn to the first or last page. Basically,  every time you open the book,  you'll find pages you've never seen before,  and which you'll never see again.

        <div class="post-content">
            In regard to Twilight being ranked higher: While her <em>official</em> rank might be higher,  it's pretty obvious that she doesn't regard herself as being any better than her friends.  She explicitly says that without them she wouldn't be where she is.  There's definitely some symbolism in the way she hops off her fancy chariot to walk alongside them at the end of the episode.
<p></p>The other thing is let's face it: Twilight has been the de facto protagonist from day one. Yes,  she's equal to the cast on a social level,  but in terms of narrative she's always gotten the lion's share of the attention.  Every two-part episode up to this point has been focused more on her than the other ponies. In the premiere,  she's the spark that allows all the elements to work. In the Discord episodes,  she's the one who recovers from Discord's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> and restores her friends. In the wedding episodes,  she's the only one who realizes something is wrong and finds the real Cadance.  In the S3 premiere,  she's the one actively pursuing the heart while the rest serve as the distraction.  I have no doubt that she views the rest of the cast as peers rather than underlings,  but it's not like they've all been given equal billing and Twilight is suddenly the special one.  She's always been set apart from the others.
<p></p>Concerning this:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Twilight was never working to become a princess. She was surprised by this. It would be like rewarding my studying of Science by making mepresident. There is no logical relationship there at all. Hard work is rewarded by giving what the person was working for. Not some other gift with no relationship. </div>
<p></p>I don't think that's quite an apt comparison because Twilight is specifically studying to learn about traits that would make her a good leader.  She proves herself honest,  generous,  loyal,  etc.,  and gets the position because those are good traits for a leader to have.  It might not be specifically what she thought she was getting,  but it's understandable that Celestia would consider her to be a good candidate.

            So,  a random thought led to some new headcanon regarding the Starswirl's completed spell. It's the first spell we've ever seen (as far as I can remember) that has an incantation as a casting requirement. Watching Twilight when she casts the spell,  it really doesn't show the typical signs of unicorn spellcasting,  namely an increase in the glow of the horn or a flashing effect or anything like that. Instead,  the incantation reacts with the Elements of Harmony themselves. That leads me to believe that this spell isn't one that can only be cast by a unicorn. Any pony could have recited the incantation and cast the spell,  so long as the requirements were met (i.e. bearing the Element of Magic and sharing the friendship and qualities of the other bearers.)

            @Perpetual: Definitely agree with that. It's a <em>magic</em> spell,  not a <em>unicorn magic</em> spell. That's why Twilight didn't realize it had done anything. It's not the same kind of magic she usually uses.
<p></p>Fits quite nicely with <a class="urllink" href="../wa/page-13611.html#post-340252">my own headcanon about what the spell does.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>  It was intended to create alicorns,  but Star Swirl never figured out that the elements are required for it to work. He narrowed it down to something with friendship,  but didn't get it completely.

            <div class="quoteblock">The other thing is let's face it: Twilight has been the de facto protagonist from day one. Yes,  she's equal to the cast on a social level,  but in terms of narrative she's always gotten the lion's share of the attention. Every two-part episode up to this point has been focused more on her than the other ponies. In the premiere,  she's the spark that allows all the elements to work. In the Discord episodes,  she's the one who recovers from Discord's Mind Rape and restores her friends. In the wedding episodes,  she's the only one who realizes something is wrong and finds the real Cadance. In the S3 premiere,  she's the one actively pursuing the heart while the rest serve as the distraction. I have no doubt that she views the rest of the cast as peers rather than underlings,  but it's not like they've all been given equal billing and Twilight is suddenly the special one. She's always been set apart from the others.</div>
<p></p>If there was one thing that I did like about Lesson Zero was the implication that they would move away from Twilight as the primary protagonist and let it be more of an ensemble cast. While that did happen in the normal episode it didn't quite pan out to the more storyline focused ones,  and for that I'm honestly disappointed.

<p></p>We know it isn't. See: Platinum.
<p></p>As for the spell. It gave me the impression that that <em>all</em> spells have incantations. But once you know the words,  you can merely <em>think</em> them. Possibly. Maybe. It would make spell books make more sense.
<p></p>Twilight of course,  can work out how to cast a spell just from watching without ever hearing the words.
