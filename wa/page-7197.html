            @Crowfall: The creepiness is simply accentuated by the sheer number of freaky faces crammed onto many things in the game,  plus the darker tone of the dungeons and the generally gloomier and bleaker looks and tone of Termina,  the land that was terminally doomed.
<p></p>Majora's Mask had some pretty creepy analysis done on it,  like the idea that the inhabitants of Termina had blasphemed against Naryu,  Farore,  and Din by worshipping the Guardian Giants over them,  and commited some pretty nasty sins building the Upside-down Temple. One of the nasty bits was the Goddesses punishing the cult that did this by twisting the universe so the Temple's tower led into Hell instead of the Heavens,  and allowed Majora to come into the world of Termina.

            I guess?  It only takes three days,  so it worked out pretty well,  he just didn't count on Link showing up and being able to time travel.  He might also be going for the sadistic pleasure in making people fully aware of their coming doom and inability to do anything.

            @Ginger: it would have been enough to wreck human civilisation seeing that Clock Town was the only major city/town left. The Gorons had lost their champion and were being frozen to death,  the Zora merfolk had their eggs stolen,  and the swamps were being polluted and rapidly becoming uninhabitable.
<p></p>I've beaten Ocarina 3DS twice,  and it has been fun both times. People who say Nintendo does all-kiddy stuff are seriously lolwrong. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">
<p></p>@Orion: I hope you're not too frightened by our weaponry now,  we ourselves are terrified of our own capacity for destructiveness at times and have sealed away such overly-destructive weapons (although we might need them if we need to divert the course of asteroids that are on a collision course with the world).

            Majora is a sociopathic Demon (argued to be demon<em>ess</em> by some of the wmg proponents due to the symbolism they analysed from the game) that see the destruction as a game. I wonder how effect the Elements of Harmony would have been against it?

            Well,  he basically sits in the clock tower for the whole game waiting for you to show up and stop him.  Remember,  the whole game is a three day loop,  so from his perspective you just show up out of nowhere,  somehow fix everything instantly,  then charge the tower to kick his ass.

            @Ginger: Competant enough that unless you really know what to do and where to go,  you'll need to make more than one three-day run (by liberal abuse of the Song of Time and the Bomber Boy's Notebook) to fix most of the mayhem wreaked by it. Also regardless of what happens,  the moon will come down at the end of the third day.

            Hi. Yeah,  that CYOA story is really funny. I think that I found all the endings. The author also writes The Legend of Star Swirl the Bearded,  which I also like.
<p></p>For my own experiences on literary analysis,  someone thought that my fanfic was anti-transsexuals,  which it really wasn't.
