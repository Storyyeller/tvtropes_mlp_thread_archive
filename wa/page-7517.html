            @Story Well,  what you were doing was more or less just a summary of what you had read,  what you found interesting,  or predictions of what you thought was going to happen. It's still live blogging (as far as I know),  but it wasn't what I wanted to do if I were to do it. I want to do something a little more constructive and post small opinion pieces on what I'm reading,  as opposed to summaries. I'm still not sure if I'm going to do it,  either,  as no one really expressed interest in me doing it,  and I'm not convinced it's worth the effort to do.

            It is serious sometimes. And it gets more serious as it goes on,  though it still has comedic strips.

            I don't know who suggested the first battle with Xykon as a good place for ginger to start.  He just farts around for the whole battle and gets tossed into the gate.
