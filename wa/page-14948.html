            Hmm,  the trailer for Equestria Girls looks interesting,  and the leaked screenshots even more so. It might be enough to overcome my inherent dislike of the basic premise.

            @CDRW:  Not necessarily.
<p></p>Let's say that the Equestria Girls movie ends with mankind learning about the existence of magic,  the multiverse,  and colorful talking ponies.  (Big crazy magic fight at a major dance with tons of witnesses.  Hard to cover that up.)  One of the ongoing plots in the Equestria Girls series is dealing with the fallout of that: human governments trying to harness that power,  magical creatures coming into the public spotlight,  how the general public reacts to all this,  all viewed from the lens of six teens who started the whole thing.

I could see them doing it as a minor subplot or the plot of a two-parter,  but probably not a main story thing.  Unless they took a much more light-hearted approach then what we usually see.

            @story:  I don't think the ponies already know about humans.  Celestia says in the first trailer that she doesn't know anything about the world on the other side of the portal.  So at the very most Celestia is vaguely aware that humans exist.

            What I have gathered and then processed (Hottiped):
<p></p><span class="tiptag" onclick="toggleinline(this);"><u>Incident SCP-2001-34</u><div class="inlinefolder" style="display:none;">  There is an SCP object within Equestria. One night,  some mysterious anomaly emerges and steals the Element of Magic tiara,  without which Equestrian national defence is rendered useless. With no other recourse,  Twilight Sparkle must enter the SCP and retrieve the crown by any means necessary,  up to and including completely destroying the world beyond. While further gaining her bearings,  she finds alternate universe clones of her friends,  as well as some mysterious girl who looks like her target...</div></span>
<p></p>I think this should be the tagline:  <br>No weapons. No back up. No magic. No problem.
<p></p>I'm looking forwards to watching it.

<p></p>Depends.  Fanon varies wildly when speculating how much a changeling feeding affects a pony ‚Äî like,  reasonably,  not sticking somepony in a cocoon and draining them to a husk on the spot.  Without the show revisiting the idea,  it could be anything from long-term psychological issues <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/18256/this-platinum-crown">Alpha Brass's<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> induced sociopathy),  to short-term physical malady (Shining's headaches),  to pretty much <em>nothing</em> as long as they don't overdo it all at once (like in True Blood).  I've seen fanfiction play both extremes and everything in between very well depending on what they were going for.  The thing is,  the only official examples we ever saw were Chrysalis,  who isn't necessarily representative of the species or prone to feeding reasonably,  and a flashback in IDW that's not necessarily canon or an example of feeding reasonably (they were gorging themselves after a crushing defeat).
<p></p>Ultimately though,  it feels like a show this idealistic would be okay with saying "you're not going to run out of love" ‚Äî at least,  provided you know what to expect.  Still,  there would be some delicious drama in getting the sociopolitical situation far enough to say that,  even if Chrysalis is dealt with.  Psycho queen aside,  their culture and breadth are <em>also</em> a complete unknown.  They could be anything from Chrysalis's hive being the crazy odd ones out that screwed all the others by attacking the ponies and drawing ire (Geth),  to a tragic punch-drinking army (North Korea),  to an actually evil collective of sociopaths (Zerg).  I've seen all of <em>those</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/22618/flitter">played<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/52953/without-a-hive">very<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset">well<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in fanfiction too.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">@Pykrete You mean something like blood donations for Vampires? </div>
<p></p>No,  like changelings <em>working</em> in charity.  They feed off love,  so put them somewhere they're likely to earn it.

            Personally,  when it comes to changelings,  I like to think that they don't have to actually drain love from other ponies as much as it is just them feeding off them without any major repreccusions {Especially if your one of those people who goes by the "Bonbon is a reformed changeling" fanon like me}. Chrysalis and her minions are just impatiant assholes who would rather drain the love out of their victims {And,  going by the comics,  also draining the life from them as well}.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
