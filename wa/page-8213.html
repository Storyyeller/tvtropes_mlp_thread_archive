            @Apple I should hope that they don't introduce a love interest in a movie. That would just reek of forced romance. It would need to be a slowly developed thing if they do it ever,  which I doubt.

            I cannot see a mane 6 romantic plot doing well.  No matter how you do it,  it throws off the character dynamics.  It's either within the mane 6,  (which would never fly with moral guardians and would severely hamper the way the group functions) or with an outside character (which is even worse because it drags the cast member in question away from everyone else).
<p></p>@Moe: Mainly because I wanted to keep the mane cast involved somehow.  Although it might work even <em>better</em> if <em>Scootaloo</em> is the one with the crush.  That was both Sweetie and Apple Bloom could help her,  and they could still drag their sisters into it.  Not to mention that Scootaloo's the least likely to want to show any interest in romance,  so that's like +5 hilarity right there.

<p></p>Well,  she wasn't around anymore when Hearts and hooves day came out,  yet her "No romance" rule was probably one of the reasons why none of the mane 6 appeared in that episode {Except for a short appearance from Twilight}.

            @JT It could work if they make the whole "dragging them away" part a plot point,  making it a lesson in jealousy or commitments (or both!),  depending on which side ends up going too far.

            I could take the romance as long as it isn't in the mane cast.  Like if H&H had ended with Big Mac and Cheerilee hooking up,  I wouldn't have minded.

I one time thing is doable,  although it would probably be forced.  Not to mention that it would be a forgone conclusion that it wouldn't go anywhere.

            Now,  a running gag with a background pony who keeps trying to impress one of the mane six over the season but keeps getting shut down,  that would be kinda funny,  in a cruel way.

Sort of like what Rarity had to do in "Sweet and Elite".
<p></p>Anyway,  the big question of the CMC crush plot: Who would Scootaloo get a crush on?  Do we go the obvious route and have her crush on Rumble,  because he's a proto-Rainbow Dash,  or does she have affection for Truffle Shuffle?

            @JT I personally would find it to be quite refreshing if they did an episode about romance,  and the romance causes the conflict,  but the resolution <em>doesn't</em> end the romance. It wouldn't have to be brought up all the time,  but it would be a great piece of characterization and continuity,  like the Cake Twins or the cast's pets.

            Eh,  I don't think that it would work well.  For me at least,  Romance tends to be an all or nothing sort of thing.  Unless you're going to make it a constant element of the work,  you're better off not bringing it in.  I mean,  your options are either have the relationship change how the cast functions,  which I think would be a bad thing,  or you have the relationship have no effect on the ponies most of the time,  which is also weird.  It would be like "Okay,  Rarity has a boyfriend now,  but absolutely nothing else has changed".  Which is problematic because people <em>do</em> change when they're in a relationship.  Inserting a major romantic element in a show that's not at all about romance would feel gratuitous.  It's theoretically possible,  but if the effects are so negligible that it doesn't really influence 95% of the show,  I'd kinda have to question why you'd bother setting it up.
<p></p>I'm also not sure that the analogies of the pets or the Cake twins work.  In the Cake's case,  they've actually changed a lot,  we just don't see it because they're offscreen most of the time.  As for the pets,  a pet doesn't have <em>nearly</em> the same amount of social implication that a romantic partner would.

            @JT Really? I don't think being in a relationship changes how you interact with your friends (so long as you've solved the commitment problem,  which I'm assuming has already been done at this point). Having a significant other shouldn't warp their character like some sort of relationship black hole.

<p></p>Big Mac's lifelong best friend returns to town from,  I don't know...the Equestrian Marines.
<p></p>AJ has always had a crush on the guy,  but <em>RD</em> takes a shine to him as well.  Cue both fighting over him.
<p></p>In the end,  he explains that he could never go with AJ because she's like a sister to him,  and he won't go with RD because she's just not his type.  The girls reconcile,  lessons learnt etc.
