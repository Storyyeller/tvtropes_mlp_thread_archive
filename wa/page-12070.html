            Let's face it  - Sombra wasn't exactly high on the 'dangerous bad guy' list. He had Shining <em>at his mercy</em> and all he did was prevent him from using his magic?

            It seems I might be viewed in Equestria as a political dissident,  seeing as I think Luna should have go at being in charge and I think Cadence is a better soldier than Shiny.

They're both pink. Clearly that is evidence of a connection.

            @Enlong,  regarding your post a few pages back: Bear in mind that the crystaline aspect doesn't seem to be 'unique' to the Crystal ponies,  since the rest of the cast had it at the end as well. In fact,  it seems to be an aspect of the heart - it's possible that their connection to the heart was simply made so strong by generations of being near it that they developed an inborn line to the heart. So while the girls had to be exposed to 'heart' radiation,  the crystal ponies are born naturally irradiated.
<p></p>I can't say for sure that the heart is tied to the specific tribe. After all,  the magic seems to work for all of them. To be honest though,  Considering Fluttershy's basically got EP magic going on and seems to put animals at ease,  and Pinkie's skill at making people... happy... not to mention AJ's motherliness. It wouldn't surprise me if an element of the Earth Ponies 'connection to the earth' was also a connection to the things <em>of</em> the earth - ponies included. In other words,  'mood magic'.
<p></p>What I'm getting at is,  I think the EP's may be the cause and not the effect. I think it's possible that their presence,  the concentrated presence of nothing but Earth Ponies,  forged the heart itself. A concentrated gem of mood magic.
<p></p>Or,  in reverse,  the huge amount of EP magic coming from the stone could have altered the ponies around it,  eventually mutating all of them into EP's over several generations. Which is probably more likely,  since it explains their connection to the stone in a way that also explaions why then Pinkie and AJ and fluttershy didn't get connected to it instantly as well.
<p></p>In short? I don't think Sombra has anything to do with it. Whether it's the cause orthe effect,  the Heart Stone <em>is</em> connected to the citizens on a very intrinsic level. It's magic is a part of them,  and considering how deeply a pony's magic seems to be tied to their species(Barring a few oddities),  I don't think it's an accident that they're all of the same species.
<p></p>

            @Meta: It's more than that. Cadance having the Crystal Heart for her cutie mark suggests she is descended from the old deposed Royal Family of the Crystal Kingdom. Pinkie's family are <strike>rock</strike> <em>crystal</em> farmers,  and her grandmother taught her how to use happy memories to deal with trauma (Giggle at the Ghosties) - On top of that,  note how cheerful her parents become after she learns her ancestral power to bring good cheer. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">The Pies are descended from one of the former nobles who helped Cadance's ancestors flee Sombra when he took over the Crystal Kingdom,  and they got naturalized to Equestria.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/tinfoilsmall.gif" height="17" width="17" alt="wild mass guess" title="wild mass guess">

            So,  I've come to a conclusion on Sombra. He's underdeveloped and in the background on purpose. Compare these episodes to A Canterlot Wedding and Raturn of Harmony. The villains in those got a lot of focus and screen time,  and both suffered from pacing issues in the second half. With The Crystal Empire,  keeping Sombra firmly in the background allowed the characters to be themselves and get focus on their actions as well as allowing the plot to develop at a more natural pace. The climax actually had proper build up with the escalating challenges Twilight and Spike faced. Overall,  despite the fact that it messed with people's expectations of the episode,  I think that keeping Sombra as a relative non-character fixed a lot of the pacing and focus issued that the other two-parters had.

            The former and latter I meant are the moon-nuking and the Watatsukis.
<p></p>So,  Ace,  did I inspire that post of yours in that RPG.net thread?
<p></p>As to you,  Kegisak... Yeah,  there could be a number of reasons for there being nothing but Earth Ponies in the Empire. But I think it is still significant that  the Heart seemed to be inaccessible to Earth Ponies in particular.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> I still think that Luna's corruption was her own doing, rather than an infection. She channeled a dark and terrible power,  with the goal of surpassing Celestia and making her subjects fear her (if they would not love her),  and that screwed with her head.
