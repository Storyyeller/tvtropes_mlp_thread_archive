            I don't think any of the bosses in Psychonauts lasted longer than a few minutes for me.  The only ones I had any trouble with at all were the milkman boss (glitchy hit detection on the TK bombs) and the second-to last thing you fight in the game (went much faster when I used the bacon and Cruller told me the unintuitive part).
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> That one was explicitly grandfathered in by the mods.  The C&amp;D message made it sound like they didn't know what was going on or something,  but Blueshift's response to his sporking was within,  like,  hours.  I'd bet bits to baklava he was following the story himself.

            Bind TK to right-click instead of Q/E (waaay easier to aim when you're using a button that isn't supposed to be on WASD),  and abuse the piss out of your dodging gymnastics because you can fire Psi Blast in the middle of your flip to keep moving.  The last couple bosses in the game hit pretty hard,  but most of the rest aren't that bad.

            Oh I've been using levitation,  punching,  and pyschoblasts exclusively. I never found a use for TK besides picking up people to see what they say? How do you use TK in combat anyway? I know you can pick up and throw boxes,  but it takes a while to aim and rarely works in practice.
<p></p>Also,  where the heck does everyone go at night. The only person in the entire camp is Ford and Lilly,  (plus the cinematic with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zilch</span> on the beach before he disappears.

            You'll find out what happened to the campers pretty soon.  Suffice to say you hit the Oh Shit moment of the game.
<p></p>TK is used to chuck stuff at several bosses,  including most of the last string of them,  and they all have pretty egregious openings where you're supposed to do it.  Again,  if you see something to throw,  bind TK to right-click because it aims <em>so</em> much faster and less awkwardly.  Try to avoid punching things unless you've triggered an obvious knockdown where you're supposed to wail on them — even with generic mooks you're usually better off using an upgraded Psi Blast that ricochets all over the place.
<p></p>Anyway,  ponies.  Finished <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/14777">Contraptionology.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>  One of my favorites since joining the fandom.

            Even with lockon,  my psiblasts usually miss,  hence why I try to run up and punch. But I guess that's not a very effective tactic. Even against the bears and wolves around camp at night I often get hurt. Is there any way to aim the psiblasts?
<p></p>Also,  I found it a bit distrubing to hear Raz cheerfully tell a squirrel 'See you in hell!'.
<p></p>Also also,  is there anything you can do with the beehives in the recreation area? There's one that glows green when I approach but nothing I tried had any effect on it.

            They...shouldn't be missing all that often if you're locking on.  Like,  hardly ever.  Hell,  after you get the first ricochet upgrade it singlehandedly demolishes entire crowds with just a few shots,  and with the second one it's one of the most crazily overpowered things ever.
<p></p>I guess if you haven't been using it that explains why your bosses are taking so long.

            They usually seem to go somewhere vaguely in the direction you're facing regardless of where you click. That's part of what makes the Brain Tank so frustrating and marathony. You have to happen to be facing the tank during the brief moment it stands up to even have a chance at hurting it.
<p></p>Also,  I got the richocet upgrade after the tank fight,  but I haven't gotten a chance to see it in action yet,  since there haven't been any places with multiple blastable enemies as far as I can tell.
<p></p>Also,  does Incinerate do anything ever? It takes too long and is too short range to be useful in combat and it doesn't work on bosses anyway.

            Yeah,  you should be locking onto it through the whole fight.  I mean,  there's not really any reason not to.  I forget which of its attacks makes it rear back,  but the moment it does just flip sideways out of cover and nail it.

            How does the lockon mechanic work exactly? Do you just hold lshift and point at the target? Also as I mentioned before,  I still miss with lockon quite a bit. It seems like it doesn't have any effect if you're too far away or at the wrong angle or something like that.

            Yeah,  you just hold it while facing in the general direction of something and keep holding until you don't need to.  You might need to close to mid-range before it gets a grip,  but it'll hold about as far back as you'll ever need it.
<p></p>IIRC you use Incinerate on a grand total of one boss,  and he's covered in something rather obviously burnable.  Other than that it's mostly there for use on objects for reasons and monsters for lulz.

            Seeing a bunch of Zelda/Pony crossover pics on Derpibooru reminds me of one of the most amusing things about the brony fandom.
<p></p>Thanks to ponies,  and the tendency to ponify everything,  Zelda fans can finally ship Link with Epona without it being Squicky.
<p></p>I've yet to decide if that's a good thing or not.
