            Just as long as her time in the sun,  so to speak.

            Just as well. I've always though of it that way,  myself. She didn't <em>turn</em> evil,  she was <em>turned</em> evil: she was jealous of her sister and something took advantage of that.

            We know why Twilight moved to Ponyville,  Rarity and AJ are natives. Pinkie Pie was raised on a "cock farm" and moved away to meet new people,  presumabley ending up in Ponyville at some point. Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash are originally from Cloudsdale. Obviously Fluttershy moved to a surface dwelling town after she got her cutie mark and knew she wanted to spend time with animals. The question is: why did Rainbow Dash move to Ponyville? She wants to be the greatest,  fastest flyer in Equestria,  but she moves to Ponyville. Why?

<p></p>Her job appears to be cleaning up the clouds,  maybe she was "posted" there. Maybe she went there because Fluttershy did; they're friends after all.

            @Storyyeller Yea,  I think you're right.  I was going for a high level of bravado,  but I may have gone a bit off track.
<p></p>@Anemoi Sorry about that,  the comic format is new to me as far as drawing goes and I'm kind of winging it.  There's more than a few things I'd like to go back and fix.  Could you points you found most confusing?

<p></p>Wow,  that's a cutie mark I don't need to see.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">why did Rainbow Dash move to Ponyville? She wants to be the greatest,  fastest flyer in Equestria,  but she moves to Ponyville. Why? </div>
The bullies in Sonic Rainboom say that she got kicked out of flight school.  If that's true it could have been a serious hindrance to her goals,  and she got stuck doing menial cloud maintenance in a small village.
<p></p>Edit:  Man,  ninja'd on that one.

            Probably something to do.
<p></p>I hope Luna gets a better role next season. I really don't find her that appealing of a character because she's had so little screen time. She's just boring.

            Yeah,  but to be fair she's had something like ten seconds of screen time and most of that was apologising to her sister.

            The fandom seems to attach itself a LOT to minor characters,  though. The latest being that music pony. I guess I just don't feel particularly sorry for Luna or think of her as a woobie,  but it's just a cartoon.
