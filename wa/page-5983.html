            <em>(sigh)</em> I hope you guys enjoy the season finale. My friend wants to go to the city for her birthday to see the Cherry Blossom festival and it just so happened to be 21st. Now I definitely don't want to pass up this opportunity,  but it's never same watching the episode after it's initial broadcast. I had to do the same thing with Lesson Zero when I went to Comic Con.

            Sucks that you'll miss the episode.  But on the other hand I would love to see a cherry blossom festival.  There are worst things to distract you.

<p></p>@Storyyeller: We have our show in a dome where we project the night sky. Afterwards,  if the sky is clear,  we view stars through a telescope. Now,  since I'm a pegasus you might be thinking,  "Orion,  why don't you move the clouds out of the way so you can see the stars?" Well,  the pegasii that control the weather don't like it when other pegasii move the clouds around for non-weather reasons.

            So,  I guess I missed the big discussion of characters being smug earlier. I think a lot of people are confusing "self-confidence" with "smugness". You're allowed to act as if you did a good job without it coming off as arrogance. If you weren't,  then there would only be two types of people: egotistical jerks and people with no self-esteem.

            I still don't see that at all.  She's just happy to see that she's contributing something to the situation.  She's confident in the fact that she knows the proper way to approach the matter at hand,  and in this case,  she's entirely right.  It's not like she belittles Pinkie or anything,  she just points out that Pinkie's assumptions are unfounded.

<p></p>Good night stevebat.
<p></p>As for villains ginger,  my taste is very picky. I tend to prefer sympathetic comedic villains,  however if they become too pitiful I start to lose empathy for the heroes or feel they are 'bullying' them,  so having them surprise them with a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmless" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmless">Not So Harmless</a> moment whenever it seems they're becoming too much of a laughing stock. Basically a balance of karma and sympathy,  a villain that's menacing enough to be cheered against,  but charming enough to be liked as a character. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSillyOnes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSillyOnes">Beware the Silly Ones</a> through and through.
<p></p>A LOT of it plays into the sympathy of the heroes however,  part of the reason I'm not big on <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist">Hero Antagonist</a> setups. I NEED to root for the heroes to some degree (this maybe where this 'smugness' problem comes in,  especially against a sympathetic villain).
<p></p>The more I think about it,  the more Discord fits this territory perfectly really.

You always feel like you're missing something that could make the scenario a lot more complex.
<p></p>A media with a normal hero can have the hero be the protagonist but still have an expanded and depthful universe as well as a sympathetic villain at times. A <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> show on the other hand tends to skew everything so you get the villain is the sympathetic character and you don't root for anyone else.
<p></p>It's a <em>huge</em> reason I think <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreamstone" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreamstone">The Dreamstone</a></em> was a waste of potential for example. The pilot had Rufus as the protagonist and utilized a more balanced wholesome development of it's universe similar to FIM. The show afterwards was about the Urpneys however so everything else was <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> or drained of character. Akin to the previous analysis I also felt the Urpneys were <em>too</em> pitiful without the heroes getting proper <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticPOV" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticPOV">Sympathetic P.O.V.</a>.
