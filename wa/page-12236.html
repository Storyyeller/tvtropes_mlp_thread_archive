I am no expert in aerodynamics or physics (is anyone here one? correct me if I am wrong),  but from what I observed in many species' of birds,  pegasi would have to beat their wings at least several times more to generate their average speed. </div>

            @JT - I don't know,  I really have no problem with pegasi's interaction with cloud,  but their casual defiance of aerodynamics comes off to me as odd.

            @Ed: I think the idea was that the cloud had condensed so much it lost it's buoyancy.  Smacking the cloud would puff it up a bit so it could float back up.

<p></p>Well,  there is at least <em>partial</em> truth in it. I mean,  there was a time when there wasn't even the concept of the First Law of Thermodynamics. It was actually discovered not <em>too</em> long ago; it was first stated by Rudolf Clausius in 1850,  which is pretty recent where scientific history goes.

            @Kegisak: There <em>is</em> a concept out there related to fallibility that basically says "It might be the case that everything we think know about physics is actually bunk,  we just have discovered it yet",  but that's less "physics doesn't exist" and more "we just don't understand it as well as we think we do".  Not sure if that's what this guy was talking about,  though.

            Say,  I was just wondering...there are all these spell books out there...presuming that unicorns can learn the spells within them...yet...they can only do a little bit of magic related to their CM.  And I'm assuming that only Twilight has 'Magic' as a special skill so...how does it work?
<p></p>I have an idea of course.  I just want to hear others thoughts.

            My personal theory is this:
<p></p>Each unicorn has a few spells that they can perform innately,  that are usually related to their special talent.  Rarity's gem-finding spell and Shining Armor's uber-shield are examples.  However,  any unicorn can learn any spell,  it just takes a lot of work to do so.  Twilight's special skill is that she can learn other unicorn's spells faster than most can.
<p></p>Take Rarity's gemfinding spell for example:
<p></p><ul><li>Rarity innately knows how to do it,  so she doesn't need to learn how to do it.
</li><li>J. Random Unicorn doesn't have it is his special skill,  so he has to learn how to do it from a book.  Let's say it takes 100 hours of study for him to get it to the same point that Rarity can naturally perform.
</li><li>Twilight's special skill isn't related to this,  so she can't perform it innately.  However,  her special magic talent allows her to learn it faster than J. Random Unicorn.  Like it only takes her 40 hours of study to imitate it.
</li></ul><p></p>It's basically the same deal with other spells; any unicorn can learn them,  but it comes easier to Twilight than it does for most ponies.
