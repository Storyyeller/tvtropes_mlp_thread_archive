            A pet peeve of mine is games that don't let you change the difficulty once you start a game. So if normal turns out to be too easy,  you're screwed.

            Though I admit that it's kinda a bummer when you got one game where the challenge is part of the fun,  and then the sequel is a lot easier.
<p></p>Like the transition from <em>Jedi Outcast</em> to <em>Jedi Academy.</em>
<p></p>I think I'm gonna buy again <em>Jedi Outcast</em> if it goes on sale. Seriously,  that game has the best lightsaber combat ever.

And while the Kingdom Hearts games usually don't let you switch it up,  re:coded <em>did</em>.
<p></p>Though,  I've started to notice that the Kingdom Hearts games have started downshifting their difficulty some. Like,  re:coded's Critical doesn't feel quite as hard as the first game's Expert mode.

            The only games I've ever started on the hardest difficulty from the start are the Halo series,  because Legendary difficulty is a blast,  and I hate stepping down in difficulty after the previous game when they play so similarly.
<p></p>I never played Jedi Outcast,  but I played the original <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkForces" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkForces">Dark Forces</a>,  and I played Academy. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkForces" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkForces">Dark Forces</a> was such a great FPS for its time,  and I <em>loved</em> the combat in Academy. So much. The lightsaber styles there put Force Unleashed to <em>shame</em> in terms of depth.

<p></p>That is not my point. No one in this conversation is trying to make you feel bad. We (well,  <em>they</em>,  anyway) are just trying to talk about what makes games fun,  and what you are doing by making yourself feel insulted is discouraging people from talking. Your habit of taking everything personally is strangling the conversation.
<p></p>And that is making me feel so frustrated that I have abandoned the use of contractions in my sentences so that you can see <strike>that I am being a silly overexaggerating doodlehead</strike> how serious this is.

            I've been playing <em>Thief</em> on the highest difficulty because I love the added objectives. For example,  in the third level,  at the base difficulty you're supposed to break into a tomb and steal this fancy horn. But on the higher difficulties you also have to locate two gemstones,  and getting to those gemstones and solving the puzzles and avoiding the traps were so much fun.

            @Bad: Well that might explain my distaste for the series,  reach being the only one I've played. It was... alright,  just overall pretty meh in my opinion.

            @Ginger: No. Certainly not. Definitely not a major favorite overall,  or within the work itself. Even <em>within</em> the work,  Simon was a better character overall,  with more development and a stronger character arc.
<p></p>I couldn't tell you who my favorite character of all time is,  but it's not him. Certainly not.
<p></p>That being said,  I didn't hate him,  so I think I should stop this train of conversation because it can't be reconciled and I don't want you to get the impression that I am or am trying to be against you.

            <em>Halo</em> is a pretty prime example of something suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a>. For myself,  I played the original and liked it plenty,  though I <em>did</em> notice the common criticism of the lackluster interior level designs.
<p></p>Music's awesome,  though.

            Well I read Fall Of Reach when it first came out and Bungie makes all these claims that the storyline was really important. Then they released Reach and basically said that yeah those books that they released didn't really happen,  were pointless and were a waste of my money. So I don't care about Halo anymore since they evidently don't.

            @Death: Nope. Well,  barely,  but it's really hard to find pony versions of the RVB cast,  or at least it's hard to find GOOD pony versions of them. Although I did find a neat image with Caboose cheering upon seeing Derpy Hooves pop out of a box {It was drawn by Johnjoseco}.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            Yeah,  if you put things on a pedestal before you even get to pay them ,  then of course they're going to be disappointing. Each game has some pretty glaring flaws,  though I'm really good at ignoring flaws,  so I'm a bit weird.
<p></p>@Bad I read Fall Of Reach,  and the game really didn't retcon very much. At all. In any case,  novelizations are always a "canon,  unless shown otherwise" situation in <em>any</em> game. This is nothing new.
