            @ Kegi: Possibly,  but then why does AJ know about her being bullied. From what we see she doesn't have any one on one time with Babs for her to tell her and she seems like she'd be pretty reluctant to talk about it. The most logical reason for me is that Bab's parents told her when they asked her to look after her for a couple of weeks.

            @Kegi In real life,  the relative positions of the Sun,  Moon,  and Earth cause the cycle as the moon passes in and out of the Earth's shadow. With the way Equestrian cosmology may or may not work,  there's no telling how it could be outside of the fact that we very rarely,  if at all,  see the moon not be full.

            I think if anything it'd hold more true. Since the seasons and years are handled manually maybe they've even got a nifty easy metric system for it. Make it easier to keep track of.

            Japnese Teeth: I noticed each character sort of has a defining scenario that brings out a distinct characteristic and some of their better plots:
<p></p>Twilight is neuroses based. Just put her in a situation she isn't 100% in control of and she'll slowly crack trying to remedy it.
<p></p>RD is ego driven. She just needs to be placed in front of a plausible (and sometimes unwilling) audience and she'll become intent on getting their full attention.
<p></p>Fluttershy is meek so just needs a somewhat intimidating or oppressive crowd.
<p></p>AJ,  in early episodes at least,  was tempremental and had a tendancy to hold a grudge. Her setup is similar to Twilight's in that she just needs an environment that doesn't co operate with her,  however where Twilight would endlessly continue in vain to 'educate',  AJ would more likely have an 'eye for an eye' treatment and quickly resort to her enemies own level in an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscalatingWar" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscalatingWar">Escalating War</a>.
<p></p>I suppose the episode may worked better if as said,  the Apples were more than just slightly befuddled and began to conflict with her,  provoking her defensive temper.

            @Psi: I mostly agree,  although I'd say that AJ's situation is more about her stubbornness; she gets herself convinced that she has to do something,  and she sticks to that course of action long past the point that she should know better.  Although I do agree that the episode would have been better if the rest of the family had butted heads with her a bit more.

            <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">It's harder to classify stubborness,  since a large majority of the whole cast's dilemmas are caused by being completely bull headed about something. As said,  Twilight's situations are often caused because she refuses to understand why others aren't the exact same level as her ("WHY WON'T ANYPONY LISTEN TO ME?!?") while RD <em>won't</em> have others not thinking she's awesome. Ever.
<p></p>I use temprement for AJ because it seems a more distinct reason for her stubborness,  because someone offends or aggrivates her which makes her refuse to back down. Her two duo episodes with another pony are basically another pony pissing her off and starting an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscalatingWar" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscalatingWar">Escalating War</a>. Even in Applebuck Season,  she seems slightly motivated to spite Twilight for indirectly belittling her by saying she is incapable,  while she steals the show in Bridle Gossip due to becoming <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon">The Napoleon</a>. Even looking at 'stubborn AJ' episodes like The Last Roundup and Fall Weather Friends,  I tend to notice they are still cases of another character mostly holding up the story until AJ's defensive temper is set off,  then it becomes her spotlight again.
<p></p>I think her more laid back attitude after Season One may be a reason they struggle to make more roles for her in this case,  since a big drive in her personality was being a bit of a hot head.

            <div class="quoteblock">Some people have posited a moon is a lunar cycle,  so about a month(Meaning the gap is about 8 years,  someone worked out),  other say it could mean a day,  which would mean they have them three times a year,  give or take. Personally I'm inclined towards month. Which would mean Moon is their term for month and they clearly don't have a concept of a year as a thing,  which is... interesting. </div>
<p></p>I've never heard the term moon used to refer to anything other than a month (or lunar cycle,  close enough). It's just standard fantasy talk.
