            I really can't wrap my head around that concept,  for some reason,  but I resign myself to the realization that it's probably the most reasonable explanation there is currently.
<p></p>(Which,  by the way,  is the kind of thing Twilight should have learned in the episode in question.)

<p></p>well yeah,  but clouds and weather are already in the sky. And walking on clouds is a totally acceptable break. But this is,  by all appearances,  a bog standard a cart! The unicorns at least have a sort of energy field thing going when they use telekinesis!

<p></p>It was a <em>chariot</em> that had some wing themed decoration going. It was a lot more believable than the wooden cart take straight from Applejacks farm!

            @Ginger It depends on the purpose of the product. Those dresses were for the Gala,  not for entertainment. I don't care for how a tuxedo looks,  but it's considered improper to wear a wacky variant to a formal occasion just because I think it looks cool. The same deal applies to the dresses. They're formal-wear,  which none of the other five knew anything about.
<p></p>Movies,  on the other hand,  are meant to entertain. The screenings are to ensure that they can even do that before they release them.

            Accepting criticism from people who know nothing about the topic is the problem. None of them,  except for maybe Fluttershy know anything about fashion,  style,  or anything of the sort and were designing based entirely on preferences. She should have listened to their opinions,  but not bend to their will entirely over the design. Input should have gone both ways. <br> <br>I think what Blissey mentioned is why I never got the controversy thing most people got upset over the episode about. Twilight was just as wrong about it. She believed it wasn't true at all from the start,  despite the proof that there might be something to the Pinkie Sense. <br> <br>I don't know if any of this is relevant,  but I'm in the mood for ranting in walls today. <br> <br>How does it mean they can negate weight? It's not like Fluttershy couldn't pull it if it were on the ground. <br>Lurker,  stop ninja-ing me.

            Prettymuch what Lurker said
<p></p>A pegasus pony can only pull as much as their personal magic would allow... wingpower=str I would imagine.  The more wingpower you got the heavier cart you can pull through the air?

            @Lurker that's what I mean. It was just you gave the general vibe that you didn't think rarity should've strayed from her vision at all,  and that her friend's input didn't mean shit.

            Thats kind of the point of being a fashion designer.  You can look at someone and make them the perfect outfit because you have an eye for color,  drape of fabric,  how its going to look based on that person's body shape and skin tone...
<p></p>Sure they could ask for subtle alterations but in general the fashion designer is going to know whats best.  If someone who was good at that would design an outfit for me I wouldnt fuss over it at all I'd be greatful that they were takin the time to make me something that would be perfect for me.
