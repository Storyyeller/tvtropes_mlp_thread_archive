<p></p>Faust's statement,  to me,  heavily implies that the ponies either don't have booze or they highly disapprove of it. So I go with that. Apparently I'm the only one that does so.

            @JT I don't think he means anything <em>that</em> extreme (unless he does,  in which case I disagree). But,  when I hear "disapprove of drunkenness",  it doesn't make me think "oh,  exactly like us." Really,  we <em>don't</em> disapprove of drunkenness. We just advocate being careful and then laugh at how silly drunk people can be.

            I guess it could be that in Equestria,  alcohol does not have a "rite of passage" aspect to it like it often does here. In that case alcoholic drinks would be considered very niche and drunkiness would have a greater stigma attached to it.

            @Perpetual: Well,  yeah.  I'm not saying that drunkenness is treated the same way in Equestria as it is in reality (it almost certainly isn't),  but that doesn't necessarily imply that ponies don't have alcohol or that they don't get drunk at all,  just that it carries a bit more of a stigma.  Which actually makes the whole Berry Punch thing a bit more interesting; like she's considered an alcoholic by pony standards,  but by human standards she'd be considered a moderate drinker.  Or that she's never been what we'd consider drunk,  but simply drinks enough to be tipsy.  But because it's Equestria,  the ponies treat getting tipsy the same way we'd treat getting completely smashed.

And it usually shows the person in question getting a monster hangover the next day anyway.

This is demonstrated by how she needs to ask Fluttershy what is bothering her so much when if they were old friends she would have known.
<p></p>On the subject of drunkiness,  I think we do tend to glorify it in the sense that it is seen as a fun,  if dangerous thing to do. Not to mention drunkiness is seen as a very normal thing,  so any stigma attached to it is weakened.

            There's a certain culture - usually young adults - that glorifies drunkenness,  but on the whole we look down on it as a culture. Because it's incredibly obnoxious to a sober person,  generally.
<p></p>For my own part,  when I use alcohol in my writing I generally only use it in a context that makes it obvious the character getting drunk is doing something idiotic because of it,  so I feel as though that DOES stay within the confines of the rules set by the show.

            @ Mio: I thought that with Fluttershy's memory of being shoved to her death and having thousands of eyes surrounding her that her memory of the events was a lot more traumatic than it actually was. So nobody who was there would have known she'd had issues especially since she isn't the type to talk about them.
