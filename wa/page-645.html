Wasn't it based on episode 12,  "Call of the Cutie"?
<p></p>(But the funny thing is that it led to a flood of jokes about Pinkie Pie's breakdown in episode 25,  "Party of One",  and now that episode is associated with that story despite any similarities being coincidental.)

            @Mister Always: If it were well-written and gave a creepy reason for Pinkie's antics,  then I'd suggest reading it (after the series,  of course; you have to know the characters,  after all,  right?).  There are several fics out there that reinterpret Pinkie as disturbed or damaged,  and from what I've heard - since it's not my cup of tea - there are some that are well-written and thought-provoking.  However,  Cupcakes is nothing but pointlessly gory trash.  It has no redeeming value whatsoever.

            Well now that I think about it some more,  episode 5 kind of set up both of them,  in that it starts with Pinkie Pie luring Rainbow Dash into her trust,  but later Pinkie Pie appears to be losing her own trust in others and wanting to "get serious" about it.

            That's probably it; they want plausible deniability in case a fan accuses them of stealing their idea.  There's also the issue that there are ideas that are ubiquitous in the fandom,  and they don't want fanon leeching into the show itself.  As for Cupcakes,  I'm going to assume that they're aware of it's nature,  but probably haven't read it.

            Most writers  won't read fanfiction for legal reasons.  If an idea in the fic is similar to something that ends up happening in canon,  the writer could get sued,  even if it was something planned out before the fic was written.

            I can't think of anything aside from Derpy's eyes.  And anyway,  taking something from the general fandom is different,  since who gets to claim you're stealing from them?

            You don't need a copyright on something to accuse someone of plagiarism.  I think the laws are a bit vague,  but its still better to avoid the accusation.

            I was re-watching Sonic Rainboom,  and I realized that I LOVED those bullies from Cloudsdale (in the same way I love Blueblood) Two things about their scenes fascinate me:
<p></p>1.) Why did Rainbow Dash land right in front of them? She must have known that they were the same bullies from her childhood,  and why were they standing there like they knew she was going to arrive that way?
<p></p>2.) Why did they say that the Sonic Rainboom was impossible? The only time it´s ever been performed was during a race THEY WERE HAVING against Rainbow Dash. What the hell did they think happened all those years ago? Not to mention all the destruction it caused.
