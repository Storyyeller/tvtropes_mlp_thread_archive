<p></p>But I also like Pinkie as Pinkie,  eccentric but not Toon-ish,  as long as her Looney Tune powers are only used for jokes not to effect the plot,  and Pinkie,  personality wise,  stays consistent,  I'm all for it.

            When Pinkie (eventually) shows up in my fic,  I'm going to strive to write her like Merriwether Williams does - eccentric,  but not Looney Tunes powered.  I actually <em>adore</em> Williams' Pinkie.

            If everypony could do it would just get way to old for something that's supposed to be more realistic. Long as Pinkie's unique in it,  then they can just ignore it when needed for seriousness and invoke it for humor.

I personally feel that we already have plenty of that in other shows,  and in this show she feels shoehorned in just so the animators can have someone to play with all those fancy animation bits they remember from the Golden Age.
<p></p>But that's just my opinion.

            @ Mio except Pinkie is the first one I've seen since the 90's WB cartoons that actually had the same feel as the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooneyTunes" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a>. The perfect combination of humor,  zaniness,  relatability,  that still manages to make a twisted,  yet consistent type of sense. Yeah there are tons of cartoons that relay on zaniness,  but few if any of them feel like they've actually captured the spirit of the classics,  they are just aping them,  playing <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">Follow the Leader</a> without really understanding what made the leader so great to begin with,  the FIM crew DOES.
<p></p>taht being said I also love Pinkie as a character,  not a toon. And really don't see why she has to be one or the other when she can be both as needed and still work.

            I totally agree that Spike needs to be incorporated into the main cast more,  which is why I really really hope this episode focuses at least a little on his relationships with the cast rather than isolating him the whole time.  Both of his previous episodes had that issue; Spike didn't have much interaction.  In "Owl's Well" he was alone most of the time,  and in "Secret of my Excess" he wasn't exactly himself for most of the episode.  Really,  I think he was at his best in Lesson Zero because he had a function there; he was a foil to Twilight and help balance her character out rather than just being a plot device.
<p></p>As far as Pinkie goes,  I very much prefer it when her wackiness is primarily a product of her personality rather than her ability to bust the fourth wall or defy the laws of physics.  That's why I think she was actually handled pretty well in "It's about Time",  she was just as random as she always is,  but aside from the Pinkie Sense appearing once,  she didn't really do anything that the other ponies wouldn't be able to.  "Eh,  it's Pinkie" is a much better excuse when the weirdness is just her personality rather than her ignoring the rules of the setting.
<p></p>@Bluespade: I think what he means is that Pinkie breaks the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">Magic A is Magic A</a> rules of the setting on a regular basis.  If it were established that the universe of MLP runs first and foremost on <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>,  I'd have no problem with Pinkie.  The issue is that <em>she</em> runs on <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> while none of the other ponies do,  at least not to such an extent that they can buck the laws of the universe.
