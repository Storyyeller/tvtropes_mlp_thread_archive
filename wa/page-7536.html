            <span class="blue">@Kegisak:I agree with pretty much everything you said,  Loki was a much more interesting character in Thor...on paper.  But he just wasn't very entertaining,  regardless of his depth,  while in The Avengers he was consistently entertaining to me.  He had a lot of presence,  and his actions drove the plot in a way that kept the story consistently moving in an interesting direction.  I think it comes down to the writing: Thor was pretty poorly written and rather dull aside from it's special effects,  whereas in the Avengers Loki was a generic villain but was still written well enough to make him more interesting.  I certainly see where you're coming from though.</span>

<p></p>Also @ J teeth,  and I guess Lurker,  yes the chapters in ponyville are rather gory,  but that's it,  after you get out of town the story gets much MUCH better about that. It's only raiders that do shit like that and after Ponyville they dont really have a big presence.

            @Seraphem: Yeah,  if chapter 3 is the worst one,  I doubt it'll be too much of a problem from here on out.  I just finished chapter 4.  I can't help but feel that most of the factory stuff was kinda pointless,  outside of finding 'Lil Macintosh,  but who knows?  It's early enough that there might be a macguffin in there someplace.  I still think Pip is way more competent than she has any right to be,  but it's a video game based story,  so I guess I shouldn't be too hard on it.  Sometimes it's tough to differentiate between what's actually a problem and what's just a matter of personal preference.  I can already think of a couple things that I'd do differently if I were writing the story,  but that doesn't mean that my version would be better,  just that I focus on different aspects of it.
<p></p>As for the car thing,  I'm just glad that it held out until after school was done. The last thing I need is to pay for a rental on top of repairs.  And for the record the repairs in question are brake pad replacements and a broken blinker.  I'm just glad it's not engine trouble.

<p></p>but on a few thing you and J teeth pointd out. Yeah she does seem a bit hyper-compotent for a pony fresh from the stables,  but her actual combat ability plunges dramatically anytime she's not able to bring up SATS for awhile. And yeah there are some things that if taken on there own result in a "wha? huh?" like the auto map thing. pretty much all of those are just attempts at working in gameplay elements from the Fallout Games. And they never really get much worse then SATS,  auto-mapping,  and the inventory controls.

            Yeah,  that's one of those "personal preference" vs. "real problem" things.  I really like getting inside a character's head,  so if I were writing the story,  I'd probably give a lot more time to her coming to terms with the fact that she now has to kill a lot of the ponies she comes across.
<p></p>Also,  I really need to get around to picking up Fallout3.  I've been meaning to for like a year now.

            @Blue: Mm... yeah,  I guess I can see that. I'll admit that the writing in Thor wasn't the <em>most</em> stellar of any of the marvel movies. It was still high up there among my favourites though,  just because of the setting and,  admittedly,  the effects. Perhaps that just made me a bit more forgiving of some of the worse pieces of writing,  or more accepting... But you're right that Loki was hella fun to watch in the Avengers.

            @ J teeth,  well brake pads aren't that hard to change on your own if you a friend or two that can help and some idea about that stuff. and yeah there's a lot of seemingly pointless stuff that ends up coming back in a big way later. factory,  well Pip got two important items out of it,  and her trip there results in something else much later. glad you two are liking it.

            <span class="blue">@JT: It's a really common mistake amongst new writers (one I used to make quite frequently) to have their peaceful,  never before tested protagonists just straight up start killing people with little provocation and with no mental trauma from the experience.  A lot of writers don't seem to realize this makes their protagonist come across as a psychopath.  I've read published books by fully established authors who STILL fall into this issue.</span>
<p></p><span class="blue">@Kegisak:I think Thor was one of those Sci-fi movies that focused way too much on the setting and way too little on compelling characters and plot.  It wasn't <em>bad, </em> though,  just not up to the standards set by the other Marvel movies.</span>

<p></p>As for FOE,  yeah,  it's made clear that she's getting by on SATS,  not to mention the fact that she's specialised in telekinesis which is very useful in combat. As for coming to terms with killing and stuff,  that does come up a bit later,  though more in response to certain major events.

            @Blue: True. I think it was one of those things that I liked for the <em>potential</em> it held. It gave us little snippets of characters that could have been really compelling,  like the warriors three(Who I hear might be getting their own movie),  and some pretty cool stuff,  so that was enough to sell it for me. In terms of actual <em>content</em>,  my favourite marvel movie would likely be the second Hulk movie,  or the first Iron Man.

            @Blue: Same here.  It's not so much her ability to fight (given the S.A.T.S and video game mechanics I can understand that),  it's that she doesn't have much of an emotional response to doing so.
