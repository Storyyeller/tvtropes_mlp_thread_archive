<p></p>I'm doing nothing of the sort. That is literally exactly what it looked like to me. And I don't care if they were magical constructs or had very shallow personalities. The fact that they had <em>any personality at all</em> means that they deserve rights! Remember,  I think <em>plants</em> deserve rights! You can't seriously believe that they were less capable of thought than <em>plants</em>.

            I understand that it's an unpopular opinion. I'm just illistrating why it was completely horrifying to me.
<p></p>Switzerland actually takes things further than I do. They declared that plants have the right to <em>dignity</em>. I think that's taking things a bit far,  but I read the report and agree that it makes good points.
<p></p>EDIT: They were capable of holding conversations,  expressing emotion,  experiencing indescision and regret. They certainly seemed sapient to me. And as I said,  <em>even if they weren't sapient,  sentient would have been bad enough by far</em>.

            @Sereg: Do you think that say,  a computer AI deserves rights?  Because that's basically what I view the clones as; they weren't really <em>alive</em> in any meaningful sense.  I see them as a sort of magical computer being that had a given set of responses pre-programmed into it,  but no potential for existence past that.

            The thought occurred to me. I largely just shuffled it away under "cartoon" and "sure,  magical construct. And not so much actually killed as just sent back to the pond."

            TL;DR the episode is horrifying if you think the clones are persons,  and not so much if you think they aren't.
<p></p>@Sereg: They were capable of <em>emulating those responses</em>.  There's no evidence that they were actual experiencing regret rather than the magic just going "Pinkie would probably be sad here so that's what the clone will look like". You can write a computer program that looks and sounds like it might be sad,  but that doesn't mean that it actually is.  To me at least,  the conflict of the episode was kind of comparable to a friend creating a bunch of bots that imitated them so they'd be able to chat online with multiple people at once,  and then realizing that the bots can only imitate the basic aspects of their conversation style rather than actually acting like them.  The thing at the end was the equivalent of deleting the bots.  The only difference being that the clones were physical entities rather than abstractions.

            Well,  the "work on the real Pinkie" part...My best guess is that because she used the pond,  she was saturated with the magical energy of it,  enough that the spell would react and do...unpleasant things,  trying to get her to go back.

            @JT: If the AI was advanced enough,  yes! As for emulating the responses goes,  why would they need to? It has nothing to do with the purpose Pinkie created them for. And how do you know they were emulated rather than real? So,  yeah,  I never once saw the clones as non-people.
<p></p>Maybe another bit of perspective. My country has the third highest murder rate in the world.  Most of the population sees no value in human life whatsoever and will casually murder you so that you can't report that they stole your cell phone. As such,  these things are quite important to me.

            That's a pretty big leap from valuing human life to holding all quasi-lifeforms as sacred. Then again,  the mind can be pretty irrational in extreme cases.
