<p></p>Yeah it'll be pretty silly.  Acting Sheriff Creme's first day in charge is mostly spent trying to retreive his badge from Fred,  the real Sheriff's basset hound,  who ran off with it.  Of course,  a certain passing Pegasus pony who's good with animals helps him out,  and this is what gives him the idea to deputise the mane cast.
<p></p>And I love that idea of Pinkie doing the interogations,  playing good cop/bad cop at the same time!  Pity the poor perp who's wondering how the hell she's suddenly poping up behind them,  threating to keep them in the cell <em>forever!!!</em>,  even though she's clearly been sat in front of them the whole time.  Some other ideas could be Rarity hating her 'ugly' uniform,  and deciding to sprouse it up a bit.
<p></p>It's all very WIP atm,  but I'm confident that I'll have something soon.  Thanks for all the ideas guys! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">

            What is everyone thoughts on a Evil Rainbow Dash,  the idea i'm tinkering with for the script for FIM: Light And Dark is the first enemy the Mane 5 have to fight is a corrupted Rainbow Dash,  thus making finind the cause of the corruption very personal,  besides the physics raping of the sonic Rainboom is a good duex ex machina for bridging the 2 worlds.
<p></p>Additional thoughts:
A lightsiders (and ponies) can devolve into monsters but they can also evlove to a mor powerful form: Some of those forms seem easy,  others not so much:
<p></p>RD: Devo: Gryphon,  what better way to show dash's fall then to have her become a even bigger jerkass then Gilda? Evo: Super Dash - think super sonic,  gold coat,  super speed boost,  invunerability,  i'm thinking to prevent being a game breaker the invunerability is a sort of ablatic rainbow aura,  if it takes to much dammange it pops and then she would go down with one hit so <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe">Luckily My Shield Will Protect Me</a>
<p></p>Twilight: Devo - Alicorn sort of becoming a mini nightmare moon,  Evo - maybe a sort of mini celestia?
<p></p>Applejack - Devo - golem,  a mindless giant iron pony. Evo - ??
<p></p>And uh that's about all I can think of

Yeah,  I get that,  I just wonder if that's what the ponies are supposed to be doing,  and if it's supposed to be some kind of stealth environmental message about power and responsibility or whatever.

            was also pondering the idea of making Applejack have a abserdly high weight,  str,  and endurace...cause you know...she's made of dark matter.
<p></p>Alternativly her str and endurace are so high because her horseshoes are...well you get the meme.

            Started thinking about combat mechanics for the mane 6
<p></p>i can see apple jack,  twilight,  and dash all doing normal combat but Rarity? Fluttershy? Pinkie Pie?
<p></p>For fluttershy though i had a idea,  for most of the fight you would see a pop up 'fluttershy is to afraid to act' but as her friends are damaged eventually it switched over to 'Fluttershy charges the enemy! The Enemy is paralyzed into in action by Fltershy's words' eventually leading to 'The Enemy has flead from Fluttershy'
<p></p>Basically Fluttershy would be a sort of berserker,  you can't control her directly and in fact you could only control what items she would use like say a healing potion or some such.

Not sure if that helps or not.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16"> As the idea stand,  I think that would sort of make Fluttershy overniche IMO,  since the party would need to be getting thrashed before she even start contributing.  I'm not sure what your party count is,  but if it's less than six,  I'd probably leave her benched.  What if she started out in a support role (buffs or something like that) instead of just constantly being afraid to act?  Going off of episodes 2 and 19,  I'd see Rarity as something of a speed fighter (although strictly inferior to Dash in that respect),  but with the added ability to apply severe debuffs through her whining,  er,  I mean,  complaining,  complaining (please,  make it stop!)!  As and Earth Pony,  I could see Pinkie Pie actually being pretty good in a physical confrontation,  the trick being to differentiate her from Applejack.  Maybe you could have her abilities have lots of random,  wacky effects?

            It sort of depends on the overall combat mechanic you're going for. I could see Applejack as your tank,  Rainbow Dash as a quick-hitter,  and Twilight as the magic nuke - if such a thing is in the world,  Fluttershy would probably be the medic. Rarity and Pinkie are a little bit trickier - one of them would be a debuffer...oh! Alternatively,  Rarity could be the healer(since her magic specializes in putting things together,  so it's not a far stretch) Pinkie a debuffer with pranks,  and Fluttershy a beast-tamer.

            I think the funniest thing about the idea of a MLP:FIM fighting game is,  that it pretty much goes against the overall Aesop of FIM. With <em>Fighting is Magic</em> it's even in the title.
