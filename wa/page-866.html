            In the Youtube captions,  someone decided to put 'Dan' while Tom was onscreen. Why,  I don't know,  but clearly they jumped the gun on that one. Anyway,  I think the image then got passed around and vioala,  Rarities Rock was named 'Dan'. And now it's named Tom.

            Well,  I just finished drafting a blog entry about this episode.  It seems like Wordpress is being slow as eff today,  so I'm going to post my thoughts here first:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"><strong>The Conclusion of "The Return of Harmony"</strong>
<p></p>Well,  here it is,  the long-awaited conclusion to the Discord story arc.
<p></p>When the episode began,  I was just about to say "Wow,  this totally redeems part one."  I liked the craziness early on,  and I especially liked that Discord's turning Pinkie had actually turned back on him for a bit.  Toward the midpoint though,  I kinda mellowed out.
<p></p>The humor in this episode goes a little way towards making up for the episode's main flaw,  which is that... it really didn't do anything unexpected,  plot-wise.  Sorry,  fans:  all your theories,  predictions,  and even your hope that Luna would have some part in the story,  they were all for naught.  All that happens is Discord mucks around a bit,  turns Twilight who... stays turned for like five seconds before Spike's stomach problems turn her back around.   Then Twilight goes around using an extended metaphor for rape to turn the rest of the ponies into good girls again (I'm sure getting to see Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash tied up—complete with struggling and grunting in Fluttershy's case—is going to inspire <em>so many</em> clopfics).  Once everypony has lost their virginity they confront Discord and turn him into a statue again.
<p></p>Keep in mind I may have re-interpreted a few things to make it sound better than it was.  "Spike's stomach problems" may,  for example,  have been "Celestia saves the day by proxy" and "extended rape metaphor" may have been "Twilight Sparkle just conveniently and inexplicably happens to know a spell that undoes Discord's mind control."  Yeah,  that's right—the whole effing time she could've just tapped them and they'd be normal again.  But then we wouldn't have gotten Flutterbondage.
<p></p>It gets me to think,  though,  that I may have overestimated Discord's power level though—between the two parts,  he really doesn't come off as all that powerful or effective.  So perhaps Nightmare Moon <em>is</em> on a higher tier than Discord,  which absolves one of my complaints about him.
<p></p>The episode ends with an extended <em>Star Wars</em> reference,  including even transitioning to the credits the same way those movies do.  I suppose that counts for... something,  but to be honest I tend to see homages as a sign that a show is losing its own identity and hope this doesn't become a regular thing.  The credits seemed to have new ending music this time,  but of course since that was interrupted by Hub commercials I couldn't freaking hear it.
<p></p>So anyway,  with this episode "The Return of Harmony" went from being a turkey to being... mildly enjoyable.  Pretty much all the good parts are in part 2 though.  And Discord is still a lame villain,  even moreso now since the story paints him as being basically ineffective,  dangerous only in the sense that he's annoying to pick up after.  Which I guess is really all the villain this show needs,  but it just highlights what I've been saying:  MLP doesn't <em>need</em> villains!
<p></p>So let's sweep this whole thing under the rug and go back to having hijinks in Equestria.  Can I get a "yay?"</div>

            I'm also glad that Spike had more to do in this episode.
<p></p>and Twilight was all shades of awesome,  especially in the library scene. "This is MAH BOOK! AND I'M GONNA READ!!"

            Well,  we troper bronies did predict ONE thing: Discord intentionally did not mindrape Twilight himself because he knew mindraping her friends would eventually be enough to break her,  since the power of the Elements of Harmony are controlled by their friendship.
<p></p>Also,  we DID NOT predict that yes,  Twilight and the others CAN SEE that the other 5 are gray.  It's not just for the audience to understand what's going on.

<p></p>Now now,  we established that the head wasn't the part she was "tapping" :D
<p></p>EDIT:  Also,  keep in mind that I said this episode was "mildly enjoyable" and partially redeems part one.  Just that it doesn't absolve all the flaws nor do much to counter my previous criticisms on certain matters.

            I enjoyed the episode,  I just thought the ending was heavily lacking. The best parts of the episode were all up until Rainbow Dash was cured with the anti-ponies (with an exception of a callback to Pinkie and her Chocolate Rain),  after which the episode kind of went downhill to 'meh'. The biggest disappointment was that Discord wasn't defeated in a matter at least a little more fitting for a character of his caliber.
<p></p>I blame it as much on overbuilt hype and the constraints of time as on the writing.
