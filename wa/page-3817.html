            @Kegisak: do you write anything other than fanfiction?  I <em>know</em> that sounds condescending,  but I really just can't get into fanfic and I was just wondering...

            @Applelight,  The ship is going into "Submarine Mode" and they didn't turn off the sauna so while the ship is covered in walls it's being filled up with steam. This is going to be covered in the update I'm working on as we speak.

            @Blue: I'm afraid that I don't. I'd <em>like</em> to - The Colour You Bleed was pretty far removed and I had a grand time of it - but fanfiction is simply convenient. It's easy to get people to look at it,  I guess,  so it's attractive to write.
<p></p>I did recent have an idea for a sort of short story based on a flash game. A robot is built to protect a clone,  but as he upgrades the facility with defenses he becomes obsolete,  and he starts to slip into existential dread. The story takes the form of his diary. Some entries are long,  detailed prose full of navel gazing and sadness,  others are almost painfully short - something to the effect of "Dear Diary: Today I learned robots can scream".

            Oh yes. Valentines day,  and all the nonsense inherit.
<p></p>I honestly don't mind valentines day. I like the <em>theory</em> of it more than the practice,  but even the practice I don't mind,  in spite of having no significant other to speak of. I imagine I'm going to be spending this afternoon making 'cards' of my personal pet ships,  in fact. Need to do one for the blog,  at the very least. It is a couple blog,  after all.

            Kegisak: In a way,  that's happened to me too.  There's a bunch of stuff already published where I thought "Hey,  maybe I should take a look at this." and then I push it all aside because the stuff I'm proofing/critiquing need to be done right this moment and by the time I'm done with those,  I don't really feel like reading other stuff.
<p></p>I think I'd be on board with the 4 kings thing.
<p></p>I don't know if I really like the idea of Unity's treasure being fake as it would totally undermine the remainder of the outline I came up with to fit with the Xanatos Gambit entry.
