            and the "experiments" for the most part didn't cause any real issues,  only one we know for sure went to hell solely because of it was [[Stable 34 (i think..the AI one))]] and unlike Vault Tec Stable Tec mad it CLEAR that the safety of the ponies came first,  if the experiment started threatening the main purpose of the Stables they were to be ended IMMEDIATELY!
<p></p>ginger just hates her because of Stable 1,  which yeah that was petty.
