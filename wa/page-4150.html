            @Red: Nope.  I can go into the system set up though,  so I might be able to figure something out.  I usually manage to fix computer problems by just screwing around and seeing what works.  Maybe I can fix this too.  The really weird thing is the virus clearly came from a completely innocuous site I've been using regularly for days (a manga reading site).
<p></p>@Ginger: Everyone goes to sleep when I get on here too.  And every morning when I wake up I find the thread has a bunch of pages from when all the Europeans wake up and start posting.

<p></p>Well,  if you've got a system restore or a backup you should be able to get it in from the setup stage.  Alternately,  if worse comes to worst you can just restore to factory default,  though that's obviously a last-ditch effort.  Had to do that to my laptop at one point,  actually.

<p></p>She totally would.  I think Fluttershy could really get into it too,  if someone could explain it to her.  I think she'd be like one of those middle-aged women who only know how to use Facebook and play little browser games,  who is completely mystified by the rest of the internet.

<p></p>@Ginger: I see no need for Facebook except as a great way to play detective and dox people too irresponsible to make themselves Anonymous when doing stupid things on the Internet. I don't even have an account there!

            I'm off the grid when it comes to social networks.
<p></p>I like it that way. I did design a pony avatar for my mom's Facebook account. (My mum is understanding,  if amused,  about my pony addiction.)

            I have facebook because of artists. It's just the easiest way to keep up with what my classmates are doing and stuff. Makes it easy to communicate en-masse. Beyond that I rarely use it for anything.
