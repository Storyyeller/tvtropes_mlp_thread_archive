            Being a gag doesn't mean that it didn't happen.
<p></p>And not affecting the plot doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. That's completely Doylist thought.
<p></p>Let's use an example. In the original story I'm currently writing,  there is a character capable of creating fires which glow with ultra-violet black-body radiation. I haven't checked yet <em>exactly</em> how hot that is yet (I intend to) but I'm pretty sure that it would easily put him at least at life-wiper level power seeing as though I don't think stars get that hot. Now,  he doesn't <em>use</em> that level of power much because that has it's disadvantages. But it doesn't change the fact that he <em>can</em>.

Or nanotechnology. According to fiction,  nanotechnology (or <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerryPratchett" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerryPratchett">Quantum</a>) can do pretty much everything,  no matter how outrageous.
<p></p>Or the whole setting is in virtual reality,  and "magic" is just another way to interact with the machine code.

<p></p>I'm not saying that it doesn't exist,  I'm saying that she <em>can't</em> do things like be in two places at once because her powers don't work that way. While your theory is that she can only do those things if she is unaware of it,  my theory is that she can only do those things if <em>reality itself</em> is unaware of it. She can be silly and jump around like that precisely because it doesn't matter whether she does or not. Things turn out the same either way.

<p></p>That's cool. Um. I'm a bit surprised. Did I even discuss photosynth-oh,  yes I did.  Right. Not that it or Sweetie Belle are particularly prominant there. And I only use the word "toy" in the author's notes. Oh well.
<p></p>EDIT: @Perpetual Lurker: Now <em>that</em> is a possibility. An admittedly odd one. Especially because... no wait. That doesn't fit with canon. Pinkie has used hammerspace to fetch her party canon and use it while in Canterlot. If she couldn't use hammerspace,  she wouldn't be able to use the party canon and the plot would change.

            @Perpetual: That's kind of how I see it as well.  She can only pull that stuff when it doesn't have any ramifications on the outcome.  Sereg's idea of it is very similar,  but even then I find it really hard to believe that she wouldn't use it on occasions where it would be really important.  I mean,  yes,  Pinkie has been shown being in two places at once,  but I'm pretty sure that if it actually happened in an episode for a non-gag purpose without proper explanation most people would call BS.
<p></p>Although admittedly part of it is the fact that I find Pinkie much more amusing when her quirks are more limited to her personality and the weird way her brain works.  Like the "I have balls and eyepatches stashed all over Ponyville" gag; I find it much more amusing to think that Pinkie is <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> and sets up her gags ahead of time rather that just spontaneously breaking the laws of physics.  It's funnier for me to imagine that all of her seemingly spur-of-the-moment weirdness was actually prepared ahead of time because she's nuts like that.
<p></p>Also this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_down.png" alt="[down]" title="[down]" height="16" width="16"> Hammerspace isn't a Pinkie-specific ability.  I know for a fact Twilight has seemingly pulled stuff out of her ass at least once,  and I'm pretty sure other ponies have revealed themselves to have items that they logically couldn't have been carrying.  While I'm all for Watsonian interpretation,  I <em>do</em> think it hits point where you have to accept that the animators obviously didn't animate every little thing exactly as it happened,  and that visual shorthand gets used that isn't meant to be taken literally.

            @Sereg Hammerspace isn't a Pinkie Pie specific thing. It's a general cartoon thing that almost all of the characters have demonstrated at one point or another,  and I don't consider it to be worth much thought.

<p></p>What would Celestia do when she gets bored?
<p></p>Maybe she would try to invent children's card games.

<p></p>Plays ping-pong. I dunno,  it honestly seems like something she'd do. Tia is quite eccentric,  really.

            <div class="quoteblock">Although admittedly part of it is the fact that I find Pinkie much more amusing when her quirks are more limited to her personality and the weird way her brain works. Like the "I have balls and eyepatches stashed all over Ponyville" gag; I find it much more amusing to think that Pinkie is Crazy-Prepared and sets up her gags ahead of time rather that just spontaneously breaking the laws of physics. It's funnier for me to imagine that all of her seemingly spur-of-the-moment weirdness was actually prepared ahead of time because she's nuts like that. </div>
<p></p>I actually agree. But if the show does something,  then I'll accept it as canon. I'm <em>very,  very,  very,  very</em> Watsonian.

            But then you'd think that stuff like her appearing in mirrors would be brought up in a situation like Feeling Pinkie Keen,  in which a particular strange thing she does is being actively questioned. As in,  you'd think someone would bring up some of the other "magic" she tends to do.

            @Sereg: True,  but I tended to just read that in "Griffon the Brush Off" as visual shorthand for "RD can't get away from Pinkie and relax".  You could get the scene to play out the same way without the teleportation,  it just wouldn't be so manic.  I.e. RD tries to take a nap in a tree,  Pinkie wakes her up. RD goes to get lunch,  Pinkie pops out of the fridge.  RD tries to go home,  Pinkie arrives in the whirligig.  The chase scene is more of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PepeLePew" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PepeLePew">Pepe Le Pew</a> shout out than anything else.
<p></p>"Party of One" is a bit tougher,  though.  Pinkie really did keep up with RD rather well,  but even then I tend to file it under <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>.  It could easily have been played as "RD tries to sneak to the barn" rather than just trying to outrun Pinkie.  But that wouldn't have been as amusing.

            @Sereg: Strictly speaking,  the explanation of Pinkie setting up stuff in prior IS a watsonian explanation. Almost more so that her just straight-out breaking physics,  since it's applicable realistically.
