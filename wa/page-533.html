            Hm. Started thread about show on musical theatre forum. One of  the members (who's a little bit of a pretentious know-it-all) said this:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">I can't say that I'm particularly impressed with any of these reboots of 1980s cartoon franchises. Like My Little Pony,  The Care Bears and Strawberry Shortcake were also much better in their earlier incarnations. The new shows are drenched in political correctness and while everything is much more streamlined,  from the visuals to the storytelling,  I find them far less expressive and adventurous. I suppose someone will try to reboot Rainbow Brite next,  and I hope the new Thundercats doesn't blow.</div>

            I find it hard to believe <em>anything</em> from the 80's was as expressive as this. And what situations,  exactly,  have their been that warrant political correctness?
<p></p>I suppose he was probably talking about the reboots in general,  though. I can't say I've given the others a shot. Though I have been wanting to check out the new thundercats one.

            I wonder if he's actually seen the show or if he's lumping it in with all the other reboots.  Because in general I'd agree that reboots aren't that great,  but MLP is definately one of the exceptions.
<p></p>Man,  ninja'd.  And yeah,  the ponies on this show are insanely expressive.

            From what I understand the original was to busy throwing marketable new characters at you to bother developing any of them.

            I only saw one ep of the original. It's second best MLP but not even close to FIM.
<p></p>The writting on FIM is brilliant while on g1 was average at it's best.

            Friendship is Magic has 6 mane characters,  Futurama has 6 main characters. Which of the characters match up with each other?
<p></p>Twilight - Leela. Both are the take charge,  no nonsense,  organized leaders of the group. And Leela's hair color is the same as Twilight's
<p></p>Applejack - Farnsworth. Mostly because I couldn't think of anyone else that fit her
<p></p>Rainbow Dash - Bender. Both are the jerkiest,  most competitive characters of the group
<p></p>Fluttershy - Fry. Both are the nicest of their groups (debatable with Fry,  but whatever). And because Flutterfry is funny
<p></p>Pinkie Pie - Zoidberg. Both are the most bizarre and random of their groups,  both obsessed with eating food,  and are similar colors
<p></p>Rarity - Amy. Both very fashionable and the most girly of the groups
<p></p>We can go even deeper:
<p></p>Spike - Nibbler. Both are the team pet/extra character that shows up in the series every few episodes
<p></p>Scootaloo - Cubert. Both are kind of jerks
<p></p>Sweetie Belle - Tinny Tim. Both are the nicest and cutest of the kid characters
<p></p>Applebloom - Dwight. Cause they're both laid back,  smart kids

            I think Rainbow Dash would actually match up better with Leela,  since they're both so quick to jump in and kick ass.  Other than that I agree with Pinkie Pie as Zoidberg and Rarity as Amy,  although she also has a bit of Twilight,  if you take her scientific studies into account.  Not that we ever see that on the show,  but whatever.  I'd probably say Farnsworth is closer to Twilight,  again because of the science and because I can't really see what he has in common with Applejack.

That was Amy he said that to. Still,  I demand someone to make a fan edit of that scene

I think Leela has more in common with Twilight than Dash. The asskicking aspect is only one side of her. Besides,  if Dashie wasn't Twilight,  then Bender wouldn't really have anypony to match up against
<p></p>As for Applejack,  I matched her up last,  so there really wasn't anypony left (since I forgot about Hermes)
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">... there are SEVEN main Futurama characters. </div>
Yes,  I realized that after I posted it
<p></p>Also,  Brannigan is a perfect match for Trixie
