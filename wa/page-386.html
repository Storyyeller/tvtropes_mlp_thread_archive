Especially not in a merchandise-driven show.  Especially if that show's aimed at 8-year-olds.  It's distressing and unfair that straight romance can be implied and shown (the Cakes,  not Blueblood and Rarity; none of that was romantic at all),  but gay romance can't.  That's not really Hasbro's fault,  though,  it's an issue with society.
<p></p>Still,  regardless of where the problem lies... even if the writers did want to make a canonically gay character (or "out" an existing character,  like Dash or Caramel),  they would likely be shut down by higher-ups before they could say 'But Appledash would be so cute!'.

            ^^^^I'm... not actually sure who Caramel is.  But I hear he gets 'shipped with Big Mac a lot.
<p></p>As for why Hasbro would object... are you from the US,  Gingerninja?  Statistically speaking,  the folks with the power still have trouble admitting that gays and bisexuals are even people,  let alone allowing a well-adjusted,  likeable character who happens to be gay.  If such a character were introduced,  even if the higher-ups at Hasbro and the Hub were okay with it,  all it would take would be one overreactive parent to start screeching about how the gays were feeding her baby propaganda to cause a national shitstorm.
<p></p>I present to you <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kami_(Takalani_Sesame_character)">Kami<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,  a character from the South African and Kenyan version of the show.  Relevant lines:
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Kami was originally presented by Joel Schneider at the 14th International AIDS Conference in Barcelona,  Spain in 2002. Media reports at that time gave many the impression that this character was proposed for the American version of the program; some conservatives vigorously opposed the idea.[2]
<p></p>Republican congressmen Billy Tauzin,  Chip Pickering,  Fred Upton,  Joe Barton,  Richard Burr and Cliff Stearns also cautioned PBS against introducing similarly-affected Muppets to an American audience,  reminding PBS that Congress could withhold funding.[3]</div>
<p></p>I'm sorry to get so worked up about this,  but it's a damn shame,  for many reasons,  that we can't hear officially if any of the mane cast (or even the background ponies!) are gay.
<p></p><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">Also,  that would mean the show would have to deal with pony reproduction,  even if tangentally.</a>
<p></p>^Caramel doesn't have an apple,  so he's probably not related to Applejack.

<p></p>Not exactly. Plenty of shows have (straight) romance without delving into the dreaded S word.
<p></p>and when I asked what rreason they would give,  I meant more "How would they word that on the letter to the development team?" I highly doubt it would say: <em>"Please remove the homosexual overtones,  we ALL know that the queers ain't people"</em>

            I'm guessing it would be something along the lines of "this sort of content could have a negative affect on toy sales" or something of that nature.  Which is a pity,  but it's understandable.  There would be a huge upset over gay characters in a show targeted at elementary schoolers,  and I'd kinda like the show to remain controversy-free.  At least they got away with Steven Magnet.

            She also probably had time to cool off. Otherwise,  Celestia could have done what Twilight and company did—blow up Nightmare Moon,  receive a Luna. Hell,  maybe she subconsciously wanted Twilight to beat her (or Nightmare Moon).

Do you have a solid quote for that?  Because the one that I always saw people reference seemed to be more answering that Nightmare Moon is not a "true form" of Luna,  but something she turned into with magic that she's not supposed to be,  whereas Celestia really did grow into her current form.

            Oh right,  the Luna free will question.  I'm thinking that the "other force" was something sort of parasitic in nature.  It didn't completely control Luna,  but it influenced her decision,  maybe by amplifying her feelings of jealousy or somesuch.  It's the other way I can think of that allows her to be turned evil by something else,  but still have feelings of guilt over what happened.  She's guilty that she didn't resist,  or didn't seek help,  or something like that.

The exact quote is "According to Lauren Faust,  the show's creator,  Luna was possessed by some outside force which made her into Nightmare Moon." It doesn't say she was an unwilling participant. Most likely she made a deal with someone or something saying they'd do something to make the night more popular than the day,  or something along those lines.

<p></p>I like the focus on slice of life plots,  but I would like just one two-part episode next season that manages to be epic and have the Mane cast save the world again. This seems likely if we ever learn who or what was responsible for Luna's transformation.
