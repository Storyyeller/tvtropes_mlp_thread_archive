            Yeah,  it'd be a bit weird if they were wild,  but I mean,  I don't think wild horse were native to North America. It's possible the dutch brought them over and they just kinda hung around.
<p></p>Assuming the dutch even had horses. I know very little about Dutch history. OR south african for that matter,  considering I think of it as a dutch colony but I'm pretty sure english is one of it's national languages

            Horses were brought to America by settlers,  and eventually they integrated themselves into the landscape. I think there are still wild horses out in Nevada or Utah.

            @Kegi: The Cape Colony was a Dutch colony at first. But they brought a significant number of German mercenaries and French refugees with them. Later,  th English arrived and took overand the then Afrikaaners moved into the rest of the country whereupon they had wars with each other. Eventually the country was integrated from four countries into four provinces of one country. As there are more Afrikaaners than English-South Africans,  they were in charge during Apartheid. Also,  English and Afrikaans were our official languages. After the end of Apartheid,  the provinces were reasigned so we had nine and the official languages expanded to include Ndebele,  Northern Sotho,  Sotho,  Swazi,  Tswana,  Tsonga,  Venda,  Xhosa and Zulu. Though our motto is in Xam. Other languages commonly spoken here are Fanagalo,  Lobedu (Khilobedu),  Northern Ndebele (Sindebele),  Phuthi (Siphuthi),  Greek,  Gujarati,  Hindi,  Portuguese,  Tamil,  Urdu,  Yiddish,  Dutch,  French and German. Though Fanagalo is actually a pidgin. It's the official mining language.

            @Sereg: Yeah,  how does anything ever get done with all those languages?
<p></p>I kid,  of course. There's probably just one 'practical' official language,  like how Canada has french and english but most people know english. Though many jobs are required to know them both. It's actually kinda cool there's that many. I love languages,  though I'm sadly not much for learning them... then again,  nobody is but toddlers.
<p></p>Though,  I do wanna ask about Apartheid,  because you made it sound like the afrikaaners were in charge... I thought the point of Apartheid was that the whites were in charge,  <em>despite</em> being the minority?

            I suck at language. I was <em>okay</em> at Spanish,  mainly because I had about four years to pick up vocabulary and some sense of the grammar.  Then in college I tried to learn Greek from scratch and my head just about exploded.

<p></p>I <em>suck</em> with languages. French was the first subject I ever failed and I ended up with a D (second lowest passing grade) in Afrikaans. I find linguistics interesting though. And I was pretty good at Zulu back when I was learning it.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Though,  I do wanna ask about Apartheid,  because you made it sound like the afrikaaners were in charge... I thought the point of Apartheid was that the whites were in charge,  despite being the minority?</div>
<p></p>No,  you're right. But Afrikaaners are the largest tribe of whites here. English-South Africans are the second largest tribe of whites. That said,  one of the many ways of enforcing Apartheid was ruling all whites as a single tribe for most purposes while other tribes couldn't join forces. Even the Zulus were smaller than all the whites <em>combined</em>.

            Wait... Afrikaans are whites? I figured they'd be... well,  native Africans. For some reason I had assumed that was just a term for an amalgamation of different tribes. Like First Nations to refer to various Canadian native tribes,  basically.
<p></p>With this law,  is it really lenient on the definition of 'knowing'? Or is it one of those laws that's on the books but not enforced unless it really matters? Like,  we have mandatory french classes in Canada until eighth grade,  but they'[re useless,  so that's kind of an 'official' measure without being an actual one.
