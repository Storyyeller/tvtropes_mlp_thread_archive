            That said,  I doubt Fluttershy has real repressed anger issues.  She just doesn't legitimately get angry very often,  so when she does (see: Flutterrage) she just sucks at holding it in.
<p></p>And yeah,  Angel was being a jerk.  If somebody goes to the trouble of making a big fancy dish,  you don't throw it out the door because they don't have the cherry on top.  I very very rarely wish harm on characters in shows I watch,  but when he did that I wanted to smack him.

            <em>but I saw this image and realized that seeing eye ponies are a thing. </em>
<p></p>I remember reading an article by a blind person once saying that seeing eye ponies were a terrible idea. The problem is that ponies restrict you since you can't really take them on airplanes or indoors for any sizeable amount of time.

            @Teeth: My thoughts on Fluttershy,  and the resulting Flutterrage,  are less that she has repressed anger and more... well,  she's just not forward enough to actually bring up her concerns. So they just kind of sit and stew and swell until she can't handle it anymore,  and she just breaks. She simply doesn't know what to <em>do</em> with her anger. So I suppose similar to what you're thinking.
<p></p>Still,  it's been made fairly clear by this point that she has a definite dark side,  or at least potential one. And she certainly seems to recognize that she's capable of going to far ("Fluttershy,  you're such a loudmouth."). It's possible she flipped her nut at some point,  got scared of it (A gift like the scare is a powerful thing,  and any kind of decent person would go out of their way to not abuse it too much),  and sort of shut down from there. She repressed what she should have learned to deal with,  and as a result she developed a sort of internal dichotomy. Where she should have become a very even and stable person,  she instead became a very timid person with a potential to flip out hardcore,  instead of letting it out bit by bit over time.
