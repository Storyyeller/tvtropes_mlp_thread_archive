            Nope.
<p></p>I really want Applejack to either 1: spectacularly fail at her basic goals in a humiliating way or 2: actually manage to accomplish the absolutely huge goals she sets for herself.
<p></p>Applejack is a perfectionist like myself,  and I hate myself,  so seeing someone who reminds me of myself fail shamefully at something she really should be able to do is very satisfying.  But,  as a perfectionist,  I know that there is no creature happier than a perfectionist that has found perfection,  and seeing Applejack do the impossible would be just as satisfying.  Take <em>that</em>,  practicality!  We can actually succeed.  So there.
<p></p>Seriously,  poor AJ can't even buck trees right,  and that's what she's done her whole life.  That's as pathetic as Twilight Sparkle becoming illiterate.

            Well,  she was upset that she didn't win any blue ribbons in <em>The Last Roundup</em>,  but she wasn't looking to win <em>every</em> blue ribbon.  She just tried too hard and ended up doing only respectably in everything as opposed to amazingly in two or three categories.
<p></p>When does she fail at bucking trees right?  After three days of no sleep and intense physical labor,  you mean?

            Wanting to buck <em>all</em> the trees <em>all by herself</em>,  getting <em>every</em> apple on <em>every</em> tree,  and still doing <em>all</em> her other tasks for <em>all</em> her friends.

            My own points:
<p></p>1) On the medals,  the reason she was upset was because she'd promised to bring prize money back to Ponyville,  and hadn't done that. It wasn't that she didn't win,  it's that she hadn't fulfilled her promise,  hence her working in Dodge Junction until she had enough money.
<p></p>2) I agree on the 3 days with no sleep point. There it wasn't perfectionism,  it was pride and her being stubborn in addition to wanting to still help everyone at the same time.

            Dude,  if you're going to argue,  at least <em>try</em>.
<p></p>Also,  yeah,  Applejack isn't really a perfectionist. Her issues were less due to perfectionism and more due to wanting to be helpful.  If she was a perfectionist,  in Applebuck Season she wouldn't have screwed up RD's stunt,  made Baked Bads,  etc.  As for Last Roundup,  she wasn't upset about losing,  she was upset about not making the money she said she would provide.

            Her other problem is that she's severely strict about being a mare of her word. That plus overconfidence led to <em>Applebuck Season</em>. Possibly also the same combination of faults led to <em>The Last Roundup</em>.
