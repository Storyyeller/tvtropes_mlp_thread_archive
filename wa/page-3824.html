            @Teeth: I'm sorry. I'm running on very little sleep,  so I'm a bit irritable. Yeah it's not fair to take that out on Ginger,  and we've moved past the issue so I won't linger on it,  but let's be fair: I'm not the only one who's getting tired of doing this dance.

            Ginger,  I'm sorry.  I know I'm not helping very much.  I know shouting at you doesn't help your persecution complex at all,  It's just that it can be insanely frustrating sometimes.  Add the fact that trying to get you to try something new is like pulling teeth and I get needlessly angry.  But that's my problem.

<p></p>Weirdly enough,  I think the thing that isolates him more than anything else is that he keeps talking about how nobody agrees with him.  If he didn't bring that up so often I probably wouldn't even notice the stuff we disagree on.
<p></p>@Ginger: For the record,  I don't want you to go anywhere.  But you really do need to realize this: just because people disagree with you about favorite characters,  or plot points,  or whatever <em>doesn't mean that they dislike you personally and you should stop assuming that that's the case</em>.  In all probability,  the people who are annoyed at you are annoyed that you keep complaining about how everyone disagrees more than anything else.

If someone disagrees with you on something,  it <em>does not</em> mean that everyone else disagrees with you on the same thing. If your opinion is unpopular,  it doesn't matter,  because it's <em>an opinion.</em>

And you may be right that being less sympathetic isn't going to be any better,  but what else are we supposed to do? I've tried to talk him down every time this happens,  but it always comes back to the same place. Hell,  if anything it's gotten worse. Maybe it's time to try a different approach.

            Ok. My issue isn't that I can't enjoy villain-less things (my two favourite shows are House and MLP for instance) It's that villains are the ONLY criteria I can quantify in any solid way. I also know that protagonists are usually the characters I like the least.
<p></p>I can't ask if a show is the sort of thing I'd enjoy because other than the villain meeting my standards,  my standards don't exist (at least not in a way I can express verbally) I don't KNOW what I'll enjoy. but I KNOW what villains I enjoy,  so I lead with that.
<p></p>I hope that made sense <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">

            So here's a thought,  then: Try a show and see. Someone recommended you something? Oh,  give it a shot. Don't like it? Oh well,  you don't need to finish. Do like it? Great,  keep going! Eventually you'll have sampled enough to be able to at least make comparisons to what you like and don;t like,  and articulating your preferences come from there.

            Sooo. . .new topic.
<p></p>Pony crossovers. What franchises do you think would be great if crossover with ponies?
<p></p>I actually considered writing an <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a>/Persona crossover during the summer,  though that never came to fruition. I think that the atmosphere and themes of the last two games actually fit well in the world of ponies.

            @Freeman: I prefer Apple Twi myself.  I'm not even sure why.  I just like the way the character interact.
<p></p>@Ginger: Yeah,  my only advice there is to spread out your horizons a bit and just try some random stuff and see if you can pick out other things that you like.  Yeah,  some of them are going to be wastes of time,  but that's a possibility no matter what you pick up.  No point in narrowing things down even more.

            Thing to remember is that we're not qualified professionals (at least,  I assume most of us aren't),  and even if we were,  this isn't the place to fix whatever personal issue he has.
<p></p>So,  really,  if things continue as they are,  with people getting riled up at regular intervals,  then the problem will have to be dealt with. With mod action,  if need be.

            There are two options,  basically: there's the blunt,  "Stop whining about it" option,  which has potential to make it worse but may also shake him out of it faster,  and there's the option of just ignoring it when it comes up,  which is gentler but at the same time doesn't necessarily tell him he's wrong.  Of course I'm honestly working under the admittedly somewhat offensive assumption that he's playing it up,  because if he genuinely believes everyone is against him then there's nothing we can do short of suggesting therapy. Because that is not a healthy attitude to apply to <em>anything</em>,  and needs to be taken care of by a professional.
<p></p>Yes,  Ginger,  we are going to continue to talk about you like you aren't here.
<p></p>Anyways,  if you've seen a lot of stuff,  then go back to what you didn't like and watch it with a really critical eye to find out <em>why</em> you didn't like it. What about it made you feel bad? you're a film student,  you should be able to rip stuff apart.

            @Ginger: I edited in some more comments to you. As for whether or not your comments on story preference make sense,  yes they do. It means that you like different things from different shows. <em>This is normal.</em> You can say what you liked or didn't like and what you liked or disliked most about those individual things without generalising. Your generilisations make it look like there's exactly one story ever that you would like because your peaking as though all the things you like are necessary.

            @ Ginger,  I'm with you on that,  I know what I like,  but not WHY I liked it,  all I can do is if something looks interesting or someone suggests it,  try and see.

            @Ginger: There are basically 2 pieces of advice that should make this easier for everybody:
<p></p>1. Be willing to give things a try even if they don't fit your objective criteria.  I know there have been lots of times I thought I would hate something and ended up enjoying it when I gave it a try.
<p></p>2. Don't assume that people don't like you because they disagree with you on something,  or that they're specifically targeting you when they make a blanket statement about some sort of abstract issue.  I.e. if the new guy says he thinks Applejack is boring,  he's probably not doing it just to bug you and you shouldn't hold it against him,  or assume he'll hold it against you for liking her.
