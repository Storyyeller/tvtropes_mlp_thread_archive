            Every time I imagine the ponies humanized,  I imagine them keeping their fur/hair colors.  Yeah,  they're not real human colors... but they're not real pony colors either (except debatably Applejack) so there ya go.
<p></p>It's like... what's the point of having a white Rainbow Dash with hair that's merely dyed?  She's not Rainbow Dash anymore if she's not blue,  and Fluttershy isn't Fluttershy anymore if she's not yellow... in fact,  to be honest its hard to imagine the ponies as humans,  period.  Being ponies is just too big a part of them.

            I tend to leave the hair the same,  and transfer the fur colors to their clothes.  Moving their fur color to their skin just looks too inhuman.

            ^There's a very subtle point on the anthropomorphization spectrum where I start to feel a bit odd about them.  Slugbox's humanizations are probably the closest I've found (on the bearable side) to that point - he uses the same fur-to-skin convention,  which I'm not really fond of.  I generally tend to prefer John Joseco's humanization style,  which keeps the hair color/style and adapts fur to clothes in most cases.

            Humanization is a polarising subject amongst the Bronies,  isn't it?  It isn't everyone's cupof tea.  I myself am fascinated by it though.
<p></p>I too would use clothes to get their fur colours across:
<p></p>Twi in a purple nerd sweater and darker purple cloak (think of a 'civie' version of the Hogworts uniform)
<p></p>AJ in an orange shirt and blue jeans.
<p></p>Rainbow Dash in a blue....something.
<p></p>Rarity in a one of those sweaters that only covers one shoulder.  White of course.
<p></p>FS in a baggy yellow turtle neck.
<p></p>Pinkie in a pink...erm...t shirt?  Tube top?  I don't know...

            ^Those seem to be the conventions.  Twilight gets a sweater vest,  Applejack in jeans (sometimes jean shorts) and a tied orange shirt... Dash usually gets a sports bra and shorts,  I think.

<p></p>Not as much as it could be.  After all... they could canonize it.  And then the fandom would go <em>berserk!</em>
<p></p>I seem to recall some cartoon almost a decade ago where something like that <em>did</em> happen,  and absolutely none of the fans liked the canon alternate forms.  Can't remember what cartoon it was though.
<p></p>My biggest problem with humanization though,  is just as I said:  half the appeal is that they're ponies.  It's like,  pony-Pinkie is huggable,  pettable,  <span class="strike">kissable</span> but human-Pinkie... just,  she'd have a completely different feel to her,  even if she was technically the same character.

            Moe: I think that's because the team has done quite a bit of research and there's little pony mannerisms tied into what they do,  so being a pony is very much a part of their character.  Humanized ponies would somehow have to transfer those mannerisms and I think that would be nigh impossible.
<p></p>Also,  Twilight is my favourite if no one's managed to guess yet. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

I remember there were some raised eyebrows at how Grim,  from The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy,  talked in a Jamaican accent,  but in an episode where he got turned "alive",  he was a white guy.

            Yeah,  I don't want any humans in the canon; I just think it's interesting to see how different artists capture the ponies' personalities in human forms.  But in canon,  yeah,  the show just wouldn't work as well if were human.

<p></p>For it's artistic merits.  It is interesting to see what different artists come up with in their interpretations of the characters BUT;
<p></p>I'm only interested in tasteful pics that stay true to the feel of the show.  No pointlessly smutty garbage,  no matter how well drawn it is.

            I'll admit,  in my latest fanfic efforts I introduced a human and got at least one critic wondering why I did so... and I've kind of started to agree with him.  The problem with introducing a human is that they're inherent show-stealers,  even if you try your best to downplay them.
<p></p>And part of what makes this world unique is the lack of humans,  so I'm not entirely sure humankind is a good idea even in a non-canon fanfic.
<p></p>And I still have never decided who my favorite mane cast member is.  This week,  it's Pinkie.  But tune in next week when I suddenly decide I'd rather kiss Twilight.
<p></p>.. What's with me and kissing ponies lately?
<p></p>EDIT:  And honestly,  I've never seen a "humanized pony" pic that I've liked,  though I'm not inherently against the idea.

            Here's a thought;
<p></p>what if the size between humans and the my <em><strong>little</strong></em> ponies was the same as in real life?  In other words;
<p></p>if a human turned up in Equestria,  they'd be as big as some of the monsters in the show,  and could hold a pony in the palm of their hand.
<p></p>Scary,  huh?
