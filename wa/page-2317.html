            This episode really made me like Rarity. I mean,  despite how badly every single part of the second dresses offended her artistic sensibilities,  she didn't back away from doing just what her friends wanted. She was rather heartbroken that they didn't appreciate the first dresses she made them,  but she was willing to do anything to make sure that her friends had dresses <em>they</em> liked. It was only when the second batch of <span class="strike">messes</span> dresses were shown to one of the most influential ponies in the fashion world that she finally had a meltdown.
<p></p>When she goes the extra mile,  she really freaking goes the extra mile.

            No,  because the dresses were made specifically FOR them. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> involves the tampering of ones art with the intention of making it more appealing to a target audience that's seperate from the party doing the meddling. Normally for the sake of profit. Rarity FAILED to appeal to her ONLY audience. (Hoity Toity wasn't even a FACTOR at that point I believe) She'd FAILED at her goal.

            But she didn't fail,  as evidenced by the fashion show. Rarity knew what she was doing,  and all the other ponies were doing were meddling to try and make something THEY would think is better,  which is,  as I just said,  meddling.

            K so I just finished with episode 14 and damn this show is going to give me a heart attack. Thats a good feeling by the way,  since the last show to give me it was <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glee" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glee">Glee</a> and I'm still eternally devoted to it.
<p></p>Thoughts: The Gala story line reappears at long last,  good. Rarity is awesome,  there is no doubt she has skipped right past Applebloom and regained her slot as my favriote. Those first dresses where cool,  the second batch where so horribly I could feel my eyes bleeding to look at them,  the only one that was even barely passable was TS.
<p></p>So yeah....corner time for the rest of the Mane Six while I huggle Rarity. Red is right this whiplash of emotions cant be healthy.

            Yeah,  when she made the dresses to their <em>exact</em> specifications,  it didn't take them very long to actually <em>look</em> at the completed products and realize "Wait. This is <em>stupid</em>. The previous dresses were much less ridiculous."

            @Ginger: Here's the thing though; they didn't just want dresses,  they wanted dresses <em>for the Gala</em>.  Rarity made dresses that were appropriate for that occasion.  The second set may be closer to what they wanted,  but it didn't fit the occasion at all.  It's like someone asking you to make them a prom dress and then complaining when they didn't get something that's a better fit for Lady Gaga.
<p></p>Twilight's 2nd dress actually makes a pretty sweet wizard's robe.  And Rainbow Dash's 2nd dress is actually kinda badass.

<p></p>At first blush,  and only at that. Again,  they realized soon enough that the first dresses were much better suited for them,  and that their own ideas for dresses were,  frankly,  hideous,  and ended up loving the first batch.

            ^Rarity's dresses were perfectly designed to each and every one of her friends; they just weren't what they <em>thought</em> they wanted.  I really doubt that any of them would actually have chosen their self-designed dress over the one Rarity made for them for the Gala,  because they were just <em>bad</em>.  They wanted too many symbolic representations included at the expense of coherence (Fluttershy),  focused too much on nitpicking details (Twilight),  and asked for too many broad-purpose elements (Applejack's galoshes and Pinkie's balloons).  Aside from Dash's dress (which was the <em>only</em> one that worked at all,  and was entirely unsuitable for the Gala even then),  they were all nightmares simply because the girls didn't trust in Rarity's expertise.

<p></p>@ Chuckles: Prance is generally used as the expy for France. Although recently there has been a shift towards Fancy. Magical field works well. Makes sense for Earth Ponies with the least overt magic to be the most receptive to other forms of it. Pinkie can predict the future. Chuckles manipulates the Present.

<p></p>Rainbow's was....meh. TS second dress was the only one of that batch that was even close to passable,  the first ones however outstrided any of the second ones by far.
<p></p>Up next: Episode 15,  where there is Pinkie Pie (I assume),  and aparently controversy.
