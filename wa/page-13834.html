            @Applelight: Yes,  it <em>is</em> good. And has an earth pony filling the role of Bilbo,  pegasi as the dwarves and Star Swirl as Gandalf. There are some differences from The Hobbit,  but the general idea is that it's <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHobbit" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a>,  but with ponies.

            @Apple: Yes,  it's very good. To be honest,  I don't recall if the story delved into the <em>powers</em> of the pony races at all.

            Their powers weren't important. Their <em>cultures</em> were. Like the equivalent to the time that the party was in goblin territory,  the pegasi are claustrophobic,  because being underground isn't something that is natural to them. The pegasi are also very obviously a warrior culture while Humble Pie is a rock farmer and they don't understand each others priorities.

            It occurs to me just now that the ending of <em>The Final Quest</em> actually fits rather well with the information about Star Swirl in "Magical Mystery Cure". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Star Swirl organizes an epic quest in hopes of uniting the three pony tribes. He fails,  but Clover the Clever takes up the task and succeeds. Star Swirl tries to create some kind of uberspell involving destiny and friendship. He fails,  but Twilight Sparkle takes up the task and succeeds.</span>

            This 'true strength and heart' of an EP...I'm keen to explore this.  OK,  so we can say that they're stronger than other ponies...this is possibly both in physical strength and character...and someone said resistant to evil.  I'm guessing this isn't evil magic though (AJ and Pinkie fell to Discord just as easily as the others).  Maybe it's evil in the sense that we would understand 'temptation and sin'.  And of course,  they have super planet growing skills too.

            I personally wouldn't say that it's a matter of <em>moral</em> strength; that starts getting into race superiority issues.  I think it's more along the lines of mental stability.  As weird as that sounds with Pinkie,  it kinda fits.  AJ is by far the most stable cast member,  and while Pinkie isn't exactly what you'd call <em>stable</em>,  it seems to take more to break her spirit than for most others.  So basically it would mean that <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs">E Ps</a> are a bit less susceptible to anxiety attacks and such,  not that they're better friends or nicer or anything.

            Not to mention that Pinkie's "instability" <em>is</em> her strength. Her focus on the happiness of others rather than herself is strong,  pure,  and unwavering. Sometimes a little <em>too</em> unwavering.

<p></p>That's how <em>I</em> did it (well,  that and a wisdom bonus). And JT's arguments are basically the reason why.
<p></p>@Seraph: Humans are the best LA 0 race. Ponies have abilities that simply do not fit with a LA 0 race in <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DnD" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DnD">Dn D</a>. Of course,  as long as they are balanced <em>to each other</em>,  it doesn't mater. Of course,  if you give pegasi delayed flight like raptorans,  it does have some amusing connotations. Also means that most ponies we see are way higher than level 5,  which would explain why they are so much more powerful than we are.
<p></p>@Red: Indeed.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue"> But this is Flutters. She has different rules. Besides. She has a lot of experience with mind affecting abilities anway. Not only does she <em>have</em> one,  she works with animals that have them too.

            That makes total sense to me.  AJ is of course the most stable of the mane six,  and Pinkie is very very strong in her convictions.

            The way I see it,  Ponies are at Level 0 until they get their cutie marks. That gets them their first level in their class/profession. Essentially,  by D&D standards,  adult ponies have had quite a while to hone their skills. Being Level 5 by default makes sense. Of course,  the whole world kinda scales around them. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

I think it's less an issue of power,  and more an issue of Discord not grasping what makes Fluttershy tick. He tried to appeal to her pride over an issue doesn't care about and isn't afraid to admit her own shortcomings. "Your friends all think you're weak and helpless." "Oh,  that's okay. I <em>am</em> weak and helpless."
<p></p>Contrast that with the Grand Galloping Gala. The animals there had no motive whatsoever,  but they made Flutters flip the hell out—because they caused her to question a skill that she considers a fundamental part of herself.

            Yeah,  if Discord had tried to mess with Fluttershy's ability to care for others,  problems could have happened.
