            Season Finale:
<p></p>•	The very blatant Remember the New Guy. Normally,  I'm okay with this if it's someone who the character knows but isn't really important to them. When it involves two characters who are VERY important to one of the established characters and there is no readily available excuse good enough to explain why we haven't heard of them before,  then I draw the line.
<p></p>Kind of true,  but I actually can believe that it’s never come up. Where in previous episodes would discussing them have been appropriate.
<p></p>•	The Mane Six are reduced to mere supporting rolls. None of them are lead characters in it and that just simple doesn't do. Instead,  the protagonists are two characters we've never heard of and thus don't really care about.
<p></p>Now this is simply untrue. Everything is from Twilight’s perspective.It couldn’t be much more about her.
<p></p>•	Celestia was hit with The Worf Effect a little too hard. While I can buy her being defeated by the villain,  it would have been so nice if she had actually put up a decent fight and didn't fall in a few seconds. Really,  that happens so often in poorly written fan fiction that I didn't want to see it happen in canon.
<p></p>Real fights are usually quick. Chrysalis was more powerful. Let’s move on with the plot.
<p></p>•	The way the villain was defeated was BS. I mean,  seriously. The series is called Friendship is Magic. Not Love is Magic. Sure,  having the Mane Six defeat the villain with the Elements of Harmony would have been predictable but at least it would have followed the theme of the show as well as per-established canon.
<p></p>She wasn’t defeated by love,  she was defeated by Shining’s shield. Which was powerful enough because of love. The fact that they used something different was interesting and they did try to use the elements which was good.
<p></p>•	Celestia plays no role in defeating the villain. In the two season openers,  Celestia played a major roll in the downfall of the villain. Against Nightmare Moon,  she sent Twilight off to Ponyville so she could make friends and thus gain access to the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EoH" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EoH">Eo H</a>. Against Discord,  she sent Twilight's friendship reports back to her to snap her out of her Heroic BSOD. Here,  she does nothing.
<p></p>Irrelevant. She’d already tried. The show’s not about her anyway.
<p></p>•	None of the events were foreshadowed. The Gala from the first season had two episodes dedicated to building up to it. Everything here came out of left field.
<p></p>This was a plot point.
<p></p>Season Two as a whole:
<p></p>•	The personalities of the Mane Six aren't as consistent and character growth isn't the cause of it.
<p></p>There were a couple of issues,  but mostly it’s character rounding.
<p></p>•	That damn echo from the "new" opening kills my ears.
<p></p>Don’t have a problem with that,  but okay.
<p></p>•	The plots of the individual episodes just aren't as exciting or captivating as S1.
<p></p>Here I believe the exact opposite.
<p></p>Really,  the best thing about S2 past the first four episodes is the improved animation.
<p></p>And I believe that Season 1 pales in comparison to 2. I merely liked season 1. Season 2 got me addicted.

            @Death Cloud:  After years of traveling,  the wandering author Runic Quill finds himself in Ponyville on the last leg of his journey. What was supposed to be a week's stay for the Summer Sun Celebration quickly leads to him moving there permanently as he discovers his muse.
<p></p>The story is a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> in which I attempt to capture what we loved about S1 with my own twist to things. There will be a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> that gets steadily <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> but the episodic chapters stay mostly light. I also several min-arcs planned like the story taking a break for a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> which is a play that Runic wrote.
<p></p>Though Runic is frequently the viewpoint character,  he isn't the sole protagonist. It is entirely possible that he won't even show up in several chapters.
