            pretty much what ginger said,  it's one thing to do it from a snipers nest,  knwoing that it would save many ponies lives. it's another to do it up close,  deliberately,  close enough to feel there heart stop as you kill them to a pony that is no threat to anypony.

            I imagine sniping someone in cold blood would be a lot more difficult than killing someone who's directly attacking you.

            Well,  if I remember correctly,  Pip didn't have an opportunity to ask Velvet because she'd improvised the plan in front of Deadeyes. Pip has a habit of putting together stream of consciousness plans while not thinking about the individual parts that make it up until after the fact
<p></p>Velvet's special talent is singing,  she also wants to help without killing. Yes,  she had qualms and voiced them,  but ultimately she was tempted to do it for the reasons I just mentioned

            Hard to say. The argument could be made that sniping is detached enough that you don't have to think about what you're doing.
<p></p>Killing someone unarmed to their face would be the hard thing,  I'd think.

            <em>The story doesn't give us that.</em> All the story gives us is Velvet objecting,  and then after Littlepip cows her she's all "what am I going to wear?"

            And that's it,  the raider WASN'T attacking her anymore. She was pitiable,  defenceless and of no threat to Pip. Pip also didn't have the battle high going anymore.
<p></p>That raider had ceased being an anonymous aggressor in Pip's eyes. It was an individual with a sympathetic personality

            And objecting would've gotten Velvet nothing. She mentioned it because that's who she is,  but she knew that what Pip was doing was ultimately for the best.
<p></p>The story is told from Pip's POV. She can't magically know Velvet's thought process and know how she comes to her decisions... ESPECIALLY with Mint-als degrading her mind at that moment

            I'm just saying it might've been nice to have Velvet not be a weak-willed bitch,  or to have Littlepip not treat her friends like shit.
<p></p>Goddammit I fucking hate the POV. And I'm going to be stuck with this shitty narrator for the entire fucking story and the only way to stop is to not read the damn thing,  which would probably do wonders for my temper.

            I don't see how that's supposed to make it any more bearable when she launches into another monologue about how <strong>OUTRAGED</strong> she is or when she has a moment of hypocritical angst.

            Velvet wasn't being weak-willed. She was putting up a token resistance because that's who she is. She knew that Pip was right,  she just didn't like it. Her being persistant in not helping would've lead nowhere.
<p></p>and also,  Pip being a dick is the POINT at the moment. Mint-als are skewing her perception.
<p></p>and in this particular case she wasn't doing it consciously. As I said,  her method of concocting plans is very improvosational and stream of conciousness-like. She came up with a plan without thinking all of it through first. She was putting the ultimate result ahead of her friends. That comes back to bite her.
<p></p>The only issue is that you don't seem to see ANY likeable traits in her,  which is unfortunate <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_unhappy.png" height="16" width="16" alt="sad" title="sad">
