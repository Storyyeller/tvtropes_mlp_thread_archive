            @Kyler that's partly it. I do think that making someone the absolute best is incredibly restrictive writing wise,  but it's also because I can't relate with a character who is the absolute,  100%,  born with the potential to be better than anyone else best at something.
<p></p>Maybe it's just me (I know it's just me),  but my ability to empaphize with them just plummets when that happens

Hm... that raises a question. How do you feel about an otherwise ordinary (or possibly even disadvantaged) character who had to work their butt off to become good at what they do,  eventually becoming the <em>best</em> at what they do by sheer determination?

            I can see why it could be a problem (due to the whole "lack of growth" thing),  but I don't see any issue with a pony being at the top of their skill set if they have other flaws to offset it.
<p></p>That said,  I really don't think any of the ponies are <em>the best</em> at what they do.  Sure,  Twilight is a skilled unicorn,  but she screwed up her spells as often as she gets them right,  and as awesome as RD is,  I really don't think she's hit Wonderbolt level yet because she's just too unreliable and wouldn't really make a good team player.  I could go on at length why I think she isn't cut out for the Wonderbolts yet,  but I have a paper to write.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            So,  town destroyed again. You now,  my first thought when Spike destroyed Sugar Cube Corner was,  "Meh they live with Pinkie,  I'm sure they have VERY extensive insurance coverage"
<p></p>@ ginger what about Twilight being the best at magic? Cesestia herself said Twi had more magical potential then any other unicorn she's ever seen. Yet Twi works her flank off to constently be better at it.
<p></p>also as to Rainbow being the best,  lets face it,  pretty much the whole "best flyer ever" is her stroking her ego. Sure she's the fastest Pegasus we've seen,  and she does have skill. But speed is just one facet of flying,  especially as a Wonderbolt. She's lazy,  a poor team player,  and fairly poorly disciplened. Yes she's got speed but that's all she's got.

            @Kyler I still wouldn't like it. As much as I LOVE Jack Rakan (who's pretty much exactly like you described) there were still several other people who were stronger than him.

<p></p>@Ginger: Lyra &amp; Bon Bon + Derpy were right at the start of Spike walking through Ponyville,  before Cheerilee,  I think.
<p></p>Also,  I agree with Ginger,  a character working to improve is always better than one who is the best,  also avoids any Mary Sue accusations.

            Remember the part where Spike says he's been ageing his gem for months,  and how it was almost ripe? We now have solid evidence that in Equestria gems are grown in the ground like vegetables,  which means Pinkie probably grew up on a gem farm after all.
<p></p>When Dash heard Fluttershy scream I could have sworn it was Pinkie. Of course since they have the same VA I guess htat's not surprising.
<p></p>I also noticed Spike never grew wings. Maybe size is the only thing affected by hoarding and other things like wings come later after a certain amont of time has passed?

            So apparently none of the wonderbolts from this ep were Soarin or Spitfire. What about Rapidfire and Fleetfoot? What was the gender ratio of the three anyway?

Nobody's obsessed withgiving him wings,  they just noticed that he didn't get wings,  while the two dragons seen thius far have had wings. It's an interesting observation

            Different species of Dragons? Absolutely! That's a part of all dragon mythologies,  isn't it? At least in Tolkien-lore it is. Also,  the more I think about it,  but I really love the greed-growing in size-spiraling out of control idea,  it so perfectly explains dragon hoards.
<p></p>Also loved the Continuity nods to Dragonshy,  with Fluttershy being scared and the mountain Spike flees to being the same one (or is it? I think so).

            Well,  given that the other two dragons are palette swaps of each other,  it makes sense that they both have wings.  Spike is a totally different body type,  so there's no real reason to assumed he'd end up looking the same.
