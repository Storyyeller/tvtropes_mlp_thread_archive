            A South Park episode would go one of two ways.
<p></p>One way would be like the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfWarcraft" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a> episode,  an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a> made in collaboration with the game's creators. It was quite funny.
<p></p>Or it will be shit and make bronies look bad,  and since South Park is pretty mainstream... *shudder*
<p></p>Good thing it was fake.

            Was it really necessary for the Royal Canterlot Voice to have a 'visible loudness' effect? That seemed to be a bit overdone. Otherwise,  I for one welcome our new Lunar Overmare.
<p></p>Still,  it reinforces the notion that Nightmare Moon was an external force. A far more up-to-date external force.

<p></p>I just read a fic where ........IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE COMEDY!!!!!!!!!!!!! The first few chapters were comedy,  but then it got weird,  and I couldn't back out because I kept telling myself things would get funny again,  just simply skip the dirty parts,  I thought......but it still is feeling like it scarred my brain. What fic am I speaking of? A 'mature' fic that involved Applebloom X Spike. I came for the comedy,  but by gosh the lolicon literally had me whisper-screaming no over and over. I really could use some brain bleach right now. &gt;.&lt;

<p></p>EDIT: A south park episode of us? I actually was thinking about that a week ago. Thought it would be cool,  but I never actually thought it would happen! O.o

<p></p>I mean,  she showed up at the tail end of each scene with Luna. But in none of them did she show up in time to see Luna talking about her real intentions. She wasn't even there for her second <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEntrance" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEntrance">Big Entrance</a>,  I don't think.

            I think what he meant is that Pinkie,  despite being the major source of Luna's problems here,  was sort of given leave for blame by also being the ultimate solution - which she did <em>through</em> being,  lets be honest,  a bit of a jerk. If that is the case,  then I'm sort of inclined to agree. Pinkie was being really,  legitimately insensitive here,  I sort of thought. Granted,  it sort of fits with her inability to communicate,  but still.
<p></p>She really needs a character development episode to work on that,  I think. Granted she still needs flaws,  yeah,  but the fact that her's has caused like... 3 or 4 conflicts by this point sort of makes me think it could at least stand a <em>little</em> work.

            Hmmm. You are right at that.
<p></p>Swarm of the Century,  Party of One,  and now this.
<p></p>Though,  I wonder what kind of plot would even be attached to an episode focusing on her poor communication skills.

<p></p>Her absent minded jerkishness wouldn't bother me <strong>as</strong> much if she wasn't the one in the right almost all the goddamn time,  or if she was ever called out on her behaviour in any kind of significant way,  or if she ever seemed genuinely regretful for her actions.
<p></p>People point to her lack of communication skills and cite that as a character flaw,  but here's the thing: The show itself doesn't treat it as such. The moral of Swarm of the Century wasn't "You should always take the time to listen to your friends,  even if their ideas seem outlandish... <strong>but</strong> your friends should also make a conscious effort to articulate their arguments better" it was "You should always take the time to listen to your friends,  even if their ideas seem outlandish. period." Twilight and the others apologize to Pinkie for not listening to her,  but Pinkie never apologizes in kind for being so vague. It's stuff like that which irritates me.
<p></p>The other cast members have routinely shown how wrong they can be on occasion,  and ponies generally react to them accordingly afterwards. Outside of Bridle Gossip,  I don't think Pinkie has EVER suffered any repercussions for her actions. She almost DESTROYED Appleoosa in "Over A Barrel" Does anyone call her out on it? No. Like kegisak said,  her actions are supposedly balanced out by the fact that she's ultimately right.
<p></p>Oh,  and I lost all sympathy for her in Party Of One the second she started being insanely hypocritical. Do what you preach Pinkie. Don't chastise others for revealing secrets,  then get pissed when they actually start keeping them from you
<p></p>I'd call her <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWesley" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWesley">The Wesley</a>,  but EVERYONE seems to love her so I'm not allowed.
<p></p>sigh,  Pinkie,  why you make me so mad? <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16">

            I <em>like</em> Pinkie and I'm hoping that at some point she gets smacked upside the head and told to articulate her ideas rather than simply expect everyone to go along with it.

The definition of that trope is "characters who the audience loathe and the writers adore". Since most of the audience like Pinkie (sorry,  but that's the way it is),  she can't be the Wesley until her obnoxious habits outweigh her charisma for the majority of people watching.
