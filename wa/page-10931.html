            RD didn't seem to be in too much pain in Lesson Zero.
<p></p>Also,  I should note that the reason Twilight looks a little weird is because it's the first time that I: 1. Did a loose sketch of the basic shape before drawing the hard lines over it and 2. drew her without using any reference images.  Didn't turn out well some of my other drawings,  but at least I'm trying new stuff.

<p></p>@JT: What I did this time was to sketch in pencil,  and then just sketch again over that with a pen before taking an eraser to the whole thing. Previously,  I'd tried drawing solid lines over my pencils,  but I didn't like how they came out. The line typically weren't very clean,  and I like the sketchy look better,  anyway. Plus,  it gives me more range to shade with the pencil without losing line distinction.

<p></p>Agreed.  It seemed to be more an unspoken case of "Um,  Twilight?  Why are you holding me by my tail?"
<p></p>Besides,  we all know that grabbing RD's tail is Applejack's job. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_wink.png" height="16" width="16" alt="wink" title="wink">

            @JT: Uh,  probably? I'm honestly not 100% sure. I get these pens free from this government survey thing I'm part of. They're probably ballpoints. Man,  shows how much I know about my drawing utensils... I just use a .7 lead mechanical pencil,  if that's of any interest,  too. :P
<p></p>The inability to erase is a bit daunting,  but that's why you just have to get it right in pencil first. :P In fact,  since you're going to erase all the pencil anyway,  you don't need to worry about the quality of your pencils or erasing lines while you're working. Just get the shape you want defined with your pencil lines,  then only ink over the lines you want to keep.
<p></p>@ATC: Thanks! Uh,  tips... I really have no clue. :P I haven't taken an art class since high school,  I just kind of draw... uh,  I guess using a reference helps a lot. I usually have a pony up on my monitor while I'm drawing them for the first time or two. I used the pony creator on deviantart to design my OC crew before I ever drew them myself,  for example. Other than that,  uh,  yeah,  just practice,  I guess. :P I don't really know what to say beyond that.

<p></p>anyway,  finished reading <a class="urllink" href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/02/story-paradise.html">Paradise<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. A great story of Celestia and Luna growing up in pre-civilised equestria. perfect mix of seriousness,  touching,  and adorableness. Definitely will be keeping an eye on this one.

            @Wryte: Hmmm interesting. I use .5,  mainly because that's what I happened to have lying around the house.  Maybe I should upgrade to .7 so I don't keep snapping the lead when I try to do dark lines.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">

            I use .7 because it's more common and I'm used to it. Also it probably breaks less.
