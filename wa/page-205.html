            Personally,  Kuroi,  I think Bridle Gossip and Winter Wrapup are your best bets. Bridle Gossip's funny,  fairly introductory of the characters,  humorous with the curses,  and eventually ends with a good message. And Winter Wrapup has the giant musical number...

            Don't worry Moe,  I'll take a look at yours!
<p></p>In the mean time,  why don't I just leave <a class="urllink" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EI7COR_DotAE9OASQPBr3qHv8peWUJUyT0yvybMXsf4/edit?authkey=CJyIqpsI&amp;hl=en_US#">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> here...
<p></p>Alrighty,  well! I can honestly say I hadn't expected you to keep up the RPG elements in a story version if it. It's actually kinda funny to read,  and it's an interesting twist. I also like the idea of Spike being an <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>,  and I think you could stand to to a bit more with it. On that note,  you seem to have a pretty good handle for Spike's voice,  but you seem to be struggling a bit with the other ponies. Part of it is the language you choose,  which is something you really need to be careful with,  since the character personalities affect their speech patterns,  but I think there's also a bit of issue with narrating the dialog in general...But that might just be me,  I don't know.
<p></p>As it stands,  though,  I think your biggest issue is pacing. It's easy to tell,  right from the get-go,  that this story is BIG. Like,  really,  really big,  and it feels like you're rushing through it,  do the degree that it reads nealry frantically in spots. It's all extremely tight,  the character go,  do what they need to do to move the plot along,  and then just keep going. You need to add a little fluff in some spots,  like when Twilight is going around town gathering the other ponies. Yes,  she's moving as fast as she can,  but other ponies would try and stop her to ask her questions. Of course,  in that situation you could be forgiven for it feeling rushed,  since the issue would feel rushed to the narrator,  but I noticed a few spots in particular that it really,  really hurt the story. The first of these was explaining the black waters. This is your antagonist here,  take some time out to elaborate on it,  and make us feel threatened by it. Tell us what happened to Canterlot,  tell us how it felt to get infected,  weave the scene for us. The second issue was the legend of the Mother pony - you said you made a long story short there,  and I think that's a huge mistake. This is a serious piece of world building,  which is enormously important in an epic adventure story like this. I'd actually take some time to recount the legend in full - have one of the ponies not know about it,  or something,  to give you an excuse to exposit. The third issue,  though,  it think is even bigger than the first two combined,  and that's when they go to the human world. Even if we can ignore the fact that they just found a rock that has a portal on one side,  that they unceremoniously walked through,  they are now in a world populated by creatures they have never,  ever seen before. They would all be just as scared as the people. That would be a reasonable place for the quest to completely grind to halt for a good chapter or two,  even before the cops get called out on them.
<p></p>The pacing issue aside,  though,  it does show promise,  and it has quite a few funny moments. Just remember that despite how much people can complain about it,  there's nothing wrong with a little bit of padding - it's a wonderful place to develop the characters,  and their relationships with one another.

            Yeah,  there was a big discussion when the news came out,  but It turns out that she still had a good bit of say in the planning stages,  and it looks like she's handed the reigns to someone who she trusts a lot. No word on who it is,  for the time being my guess is Amy Keating Rogers,  since she worked on an episode or two with Faust,  but who knows? I guess all we can do is just wait and see how the new season turns out.

            Considering she still wrote most of the pre-production scripts and that most of her old coworkers (she didn't make the show amazing on her own) are still there I think season 2 will be safe.

            To add to the above (<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">x5):
<p></p><ul><li>I don't think there's many times in the show where Spike refers to Twilight by her full name and as such,  constantly seeing him call her Twilight Sparkle feels a bit jarring
</li><li><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The part where Rainbow falls down into the lab</span> feels a bit long winded.  I almost felt like I needed to take a deep breath after reading those sentences.
</li><li>Spike sure seems nonchalent about the humans.  It kind of feels like he's aware that the reader is human.  If he's supposed to be in universe narrating to a pony/ponies,  then he definitely needs to stop to elaborate to them.
</li><li>The RPG elements felt a little jarring at first,  even if they make me grin.  Toward the end,  it felt like the story was implying that the ponies had somehow been sucked into someone's RPG version of the real world.  If that's what you're going for,  then nevermind.  However,  if you're going for something closer to the actual real world,  I would advise reconsidering the RPG elements.
