<p></p>We know that there is going to be a TV movie of some kind eventually,  but there's no confirmation of what that might be just yet. Popular speculation is that it's going to be Equestria Girls.
<p></p>As for the comic,  I'm fairly sure that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.comixology.com">Comixology<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> sells international,  if you don't mind reading in digital format.

            My headcanon is that humans once existed in the world of Equestria,  but died out or mysteriously left a long time along,  leaving by relics of their society.

            I think the sad thing about MMC is that the big surprise was ruined due to the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise Driven</a> nature of the show. The only real surprise the episode had was the celestial plane which was pretty much the only thing that wasn't in promotional materials in any capacity. Even the fact Celestia was going to sing was spoiled a few days before.
<p></p>Compare the Season 2 finale,  which had a lot of hype and build up,  but there was still a big twist in the episode that no one really saw coming; the Changelings. There was like one news article that most of the fandom didn't notice that mentioned it,  but they didn't post a video or anything. All the focus in the promos was on Cadance &amp; Shining Armor and the wedding itself,  and in hindsight I realize why.
<p></p>There are no changelings in the Royal Wedding toyline. We're only <em>now</em> getting Queen Chrysalis toys,  most likely due to <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">popular demand</a>,  a year after her debut and long after the Wedding line ended.
<p></p>Granted there aren't really any new characters to make toys out of from MMC unless you count the blonde hoofmaidens that show up for one scene. Now that I think about it,  why isn't Hasbro making toys of them? Their one role is to sing how great the Twilight Princess is!
<p></p>What I'm trying to say is,  continuing this trend I think the only really big surprises from the show finales will be stuff Hasbro <em>doesn't</em> intend to make toys of (at least not right away during the appropriate toyline).
<p></p>Oh and for the record I liked the Season 3 finale. It was a musical! It had feels! Its hard for me to hate on it even if I think it should have been a two-parter.

            @Kayeka: They've had more obvious pranks in past years,  but too many people complained.  Like two years ago for instance,  everybody's avatar turned into a picture of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spartacus" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spartacus">Spartacus</a>,  and then every few hours,  the avatars would cycle through different pictures.  I personally thought it was amusing,  but a lot of people got really annoyed.
