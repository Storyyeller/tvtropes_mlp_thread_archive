<p></p>I know a bit,  but not all of of <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaVinci" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaVinci">Da Vinci</a>'s work focused on flight.  I couldn't imagine him as a Pegasus... unless he was trying to do it for the good of all ponykind.. giving the gift of flight to his brethren.

            Well,  try reading the Doctor Whooves: The Series fics. Second one involves the Doctor,  Twi and RD meat Leonardo de Hoovsie
<p></p>And even if concrete is there,  using it like that,  making a dam that looks like that.. it just.. felt.. so so out of place.
<p></p>That's my issue with all of it,  it all felt like they were simply tossing ion stuff without any thought about how it matched the setting.

            Yeah,  the series tech level is basically whatever it needs to be for a given gag. Though they have been good about <em>mostly</em> sticking to a vaguely renaissance-era setting.
<p></p>I also disliked Mare-Do-Well,  though it had a lot of good gags so I don't <em>hate</em> it by any means. I just felt that a lot of the pacing and characterization was rushed. And the girl's motivation was a bit confusing - their lauding Mare Do Well felt kind of like a 'isn't this annoying,  Dash?' thing,  but their behaviour <em>as</em> Mare-Do-Well felt more like they were trying to demonstrate that a hero should be humble and get shit done. Felt kind of like a 'have your cake and eat it to' issue,  there.

            Even AS MDW,  yeah most of it felt like that,  but,  Fluttershy doing that fly over,  why? Seriously,  that was pointless,  served no function other then shoehorning in Fluttershy into the outfit for a scene.
<p></p>Granted,  as much as gripe,  one of the scenes people complain the most about,  he one where they all praised MDW,  that one really.. I got no issue with.
<p></p>Hell I just hope we get more info about Starswirl.

            I don't think that one "Fancy" speaking Gryphon is enough to determine that the entirety of Europe is full of Gryphons.  We've seen two whole Gryphons (as I recall).  Gilda had a slightly New York sounding accent nobody is saying New York is full of Gryphons.

            @Seraphem: The the flyover was just to keep MMDW's identity a secret.  RD knew she had unicorn powers,  and showing her flying meant that RD had no chance of figuring out who it was.  It just makes the real identity more ambiguous,  which was kind of the point of the MMDW in the first place.

            Actually,  it makes it make even less sense and pretty much means that it's either Luna,  Celestia,  or multiple ponies. Prevents any chance of it being just one pony,  plus pretty much made it clear it was all the Mane 6 through that.

            @Turtle: No,  but it is something that people speculate about since Equestria is essentially a fantastical America (complete with punny city names) and Gryphon lands are to the east according to the map.
<p></p>I don't think they are the only things that are in what ever the world's equivalent to Europe is,  but I do like to think that they have a nation (or nations) there and I like to think that they speak Romance languages there.

Ever since reading The Sweetie Chronicles. I've come to the conclusion that Sweetie Belle is by far the most interesting CMC as well as the most likely to be an actual super hero.

            I get annoyed at Fanon sometimes.  Hah.
<p></p>I posted a picture of my Bat Pony plush and some guy started lecturing me about how inaccurate it was based on Fanon.
<p></p>Um... what?  They've only been officially recognized as canon within the last month.  And we've only seen TWO..  How do you know they don't have green hair?

            I seem to be the only person here who really dislikes Feeling Pinkie Keen. That,  and just about all the Spike episodes aside from Owl's Well that Ends Well and Secret of My Excess. I like the character,  but he's cursed with fairly bad episodes.

            Sweetie Belle <em>is</em> the most interesting of the CMC. She somehow manages to be ditzy <em>and</em> successfully devious,  seems to give absolutely zero fucks about her cutie mark situation compared to Applebloom,  and is pretty comfortable with herself when compared to Scootaloo. She wants her sister to like her a lot,  but knows well enough she isn't willing to give up who she is for that. She's clever,  happy,  self-confidant and sensitive. She's actually an amazingly well-adjusted kid,  and I have to admit it makes me <em>really</em> interested in her family situation,  given how weird her parents seem to be. Nice,  sure,  but also pretty funny.

I was once criticized because a story I wrote didn't follow a map someone had cobbled together. It's canonically inaccurate <em>now</em>,  but at the <em>time</em>...
<p></p>Seriously,  fanon is fanon. You can't be 'inaccurate' to fanon.

            Ok well maybe I'm more annoyed with the people who insist their Fanon is canon :P  There are quite a few that I've butted heads with,  two over the bat pony plush actually.  The one guy was more calling me out because I "made it to be cool" because of the recent quote from Faust.
<p></p>I've been literally working on that thing for half a year now because of my stupid schedule.

            Heh. Well either way,  I think it's awesome,  despite being divorced far and away from my personal fanon,  so there's that. 'to be cool' is a silly accusation. Like,  are they accusing you of jumping on a bandwagon? They don't really have any basis for that.
