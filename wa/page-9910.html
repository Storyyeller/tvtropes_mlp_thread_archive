            <div class="quoteblock"> @Sereg: He didn't seem to be a colt in "Over a Barrel",  he just had a different mane/tail style. Or are you using that fanon anyway?</div>
He looked like a colt to me. He was certainly short enough.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> @Sereg The problem here is that all of that sounds like the plot to a whole fic by itself,  rather than offhand background in your story about Star Swirl.</div>
<p></p>Why is this a problem? I’ve always been of the opinion that you should leave the audience with the impression that there’s plenty more going on in the background. I could write a fic like that,  but I’m not. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory">The fic isn’t about him</a> even if he plays an important role ie. Finally resolving the plot!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> @Sereg: Yeah,  I feel like you're overpowering him a bit. </div>
It’s not like this is unprecedented in Equestria. I’ve always been of the view that every pony is literally superhuman when it comes to their special talent.
<div class="quoteblock">The other thing is that I feel like you're starting to switch over from "analyzing the ponies' canon abilities" to just making stuff up. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing,  but one of the bits I really liked about it was how you explained everything while keeping it in the realm of actual possibility. Unless there's a serious nerf of some sort I think giving him a reusable time travel spell is a bit much.</div>
Well,  as I said,  he can’ do anything with travel to the past that hasn’t been done in the show before and for the future,  it isn’t predictive anyway. In his case,  I thought,  “What if the fanon about Doctor Whooves being a time traveller is right? If that were true,  Star Swirl would be interested. It would also explain certain things in the show,  like young Derpy in Cutie Pox.” Then I realised that t would be a waste for me not to run with the idea,  especially as it allows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Star Swirl the 147th to meet Star Swirl the Bearded and let me have some fun with the events of Hearth’s Warming Eve.</span>

            @Sereg: I guess this another one of those points where our interpretation of cutie marks differ; there's no way every pony has a superpower level talent.  That and you know how I am when it comes to sticking to canon. Doesn't help that I'm admittedly not a big fan of the whole Dr Whooves fanon anyway.

<p></p>EDIT:Normally I'd be with you on canon and I certainly don't like the fanon that he's THE Doctor,  but I'm fine with expies and those in charge of the show seem to like it,  plus time travel is canon and explains certain things.

            That's a bit closer,  but I still think you're overstating it a bit.  Typically,  I'd put a pony's special talent at a simple "noticeably above average" level rather than superhuman.  I.e. Rarity's special talent is fashion related stuff,  but it doesn't really give her the ability to do anything that a similarly talented human couldn't do.

            ^^Not at all,  but I'm not sure how that translates to her being able to outcompete "small human companies" - which I take to mean a group large enough to run their own functional farmstand selling apples/apple products/cider - alone.
<p></p>^Okay,  are we using 'superhuman' as in 'literally better than a human could do' or 'superhuman' as in 'superpony'? =P

            Yeah,  AJ can do a good chunk of the harvest herself,  but no way could she possibly run the farm without help from her family.
<p></p><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16">The way I'm using it is that "Superhuman" is to "Superpony" what "Human" is to "pony".  That is,  in this context it would mean that a pony's performance is so high above average that they'd have to have savant level skill to pull it off.  In other words,  having that level of skill in something would be highly unusual.  Which is why I don't think that's the case.  The Cutie Mark doesn't grant awesome abilities,  it just serves as a symbol that the pony in question likes and is good at a certain skill.
<p></p>I.e. If a pony's skill is "music",  it just means that they're better than the average pony at it,  and they enjoy it.  It doesn't mean that every pony with that CM is a Mozart level virtuoso.

            @Sereg I guess what I'm getting at is that Star Swirl's story has been treading thin line between developing a really cool character and being a mouthpiece for your fanon. It's a dangerous line to straddle,  and the more outlandish the fanon gets the more likely it becomes for the focus to be taken off of Star Swirl's character and put more on her explanations of the phenomena,  which was a major problem I had with the Pinkie Pie chapter.
<p></p>Now,  if you can do it well,  then nothing's stoping you. You just have to be <em>very</em> careful.

The first few chapters were basically "Star Swirl explains the mechanics behind what we see",  which works fine.  But it's starting to shift into "Star Swirl starts commenting on stuff that we've never seen before".  Like Perpetual said,  it looks like the story is starting to be less about her self-discovery and more about her simply expounding on various subjects.

            I take Cutie Pox as demonstration of how insanely powerful cutie marks are. It's generally agreed that Applebloom's talent will have something to do with repair/mechanics/making stuff. <em>Not</em> loop-de-hooping. This means that a cutie mark can take you from <em>not talented</em> to <em>breaking laws of physics</em>. That's what a cutie mark does. As for Rarity,  her talent is finding and creating beauty. She can detect gems from days travel away,  her best friend has the body of a model and she was able to present it as such,  she can create fabulous dresses in ridiculously short periods of time,  casually bumped into Fleur de Lis who's agreed by most to be a supermodel and knows art.
<p></p>EDIT: @Perpetual Lurker: My fanon is meant to be there mostly as a tool. The story is about Star Swirl. I'm <em>leaving out most of my fanon</em> and <em>adding things that I don't actualy believe</em> as I hink that it helps the story. Doctor Whooves is in the second case (sort of. I've become more attatched to it after the events of It's about Time).
