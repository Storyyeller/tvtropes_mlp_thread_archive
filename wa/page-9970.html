On the subject of ponies with surprisingly sexy voices,  I was led to a video of a Swedish dub of the original My Little Pony cartoon the other day,  and Shady's voice was... NOT what I was expecting.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_smile.png" height="16" width="16" alt="smile" title="smile">
<p></p>Okay,  so for next season they need to bring back: Sea Ponies with their singing,  Shady with her sunglasses,  Minty with her socks... What else?

            Yeah,  it was "The Glass Princess" on the MyLittlePonySwedish channel that had the Shady scenes.  She even got a song in the second part.  I also liked her solo in "Mish Mash Melee",  since the dubbed voice actually sang it,  while the English voice just kinda squeaks out the words.

<p></p>Well,  it's a little more B.S. than that.  Ginger knew he shouldn't have made that post and was actually on his way to self-thump it when he discovered he had been hammered.  So essentially he got banned for being slightly slower than a mod.
<p></p>I personally think Ginger should be allowed back in,  in light of that.  Guy knew he had made a mistake,  and he was going to fix it himself without anyone telling him to do so,  he just didn't get a chance.

<p></p>That would be like getting caught speeding and telling the officer "But I was just about to slow down!" No mod would buy it,  and even if it was true,  it doesn't excuse flying off the handle.

            Also it doesn't matter if you self thump a post before the mod reads it,  they can still read the post and I've seen at least one occasion where the person who self thumped got a worse sentence because they tried to hide their mistake.

            The other sexy voice I can recall from pre-FIM MLP was Star Catcher,  the first pegasus of G3,  in the original English.  I think fans disagree on whether she sounds really stoned all the time or really horny all the time,  but either way seems hilariously inappropriate for a children's cartoon.  <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_wink.png" height="16" width="16" alt="wink" title="wink">

<p></p>First off,  nobody speeds by accident unless they're inebriated.  Getting angry and making rants is surprisingly easy to do,  especially ever since the internet gave people an easy vent for it.
<p></p>Second,  speeding could actually hurt people.  Don't try to put it on the same level as ranting about a fanfic.
<p></p>Third,  it might not excuse flying off the handle,  but it does mean the punishment may be harsher than what was warranted.  Maybe a month-ban would be warranted,  but a permaban?  Because he dissed a fanfic?  That's bullshit.

<p></p>... WHAT?!
<p></p>Assuming you remember that instance correctly,  that kind of thing is just scary,  and basically implies that we all have to be perfect little Jesus robots who never do anything wrong or we might get punished even if we make amends.  That,  again,  is bullshit.

            I'd also like Ginger back as long as he wants to return here. His arguments (to me) were quite insightful at times.

            @Moe It wasn't just for that one rant. It was the culmination of months of warnings extra chances. It was a consistent problem that Ginger showed no signs of being able to fix,  and the mods were fed up with it. He blew it,  and that's that.
<p></p>Do I want him back? Only if he has learned to not take differing opinions as a personal attack,  and has learned to not take reading/watching something that he doesn't like as something so offensive or rage inducing that he ends up causing himself more mental anguish than any form of entertainment should ever reasonably cause before sharing that anguish with the rest of us. He was cool to talk to when he was reasonable,  but he just wasn't a lot of the time.

Well I already have G3 Pinkie Pie pegged as the alcoholic,  so,  yeah,  Star Catcher would be the latter.  You could make all sorts of jokes about what she was <em>really</em> doing with Skywishes in "Dancing in the Clouds" that had to be kept secret.

            In the example of mods bringing harsher judgement on those who make edits. The situation in question is usually a Ninja Troll,  who posts something that is Trollpost worthy and then blanks it after reactions start.

<p></p>I can deal with what looks to be an episode opener. I can't deal with mid episode spoilerations. Even if it looks like Mane Six in Canterlot.

<p></p>Hey,  you know who else isn't reasonable most of the time?  Yahtzee,  the Angry Video Game Nerd,  the Nostalgia Critic...
<p></p>And frankly,  I'm willing to bet that half the kerfluffles that get blamed on Ginger were really communication errors of some sort that got blown out of proportion.  This forum has a way of making you feel like you <em>have</em> to put extra umph into your reviews or opinions or you'll just get drowned out,  and I can't count how many times I said something that was perfectly clear and people still read it as something else entirely or else misunderstand the message.
<p></p>Yes,  Ginger had blowups.  Name me a single person here who hasn't.  Heck,  the guy who <em>founded</em> this website is known to go crazy at times.  It's not fair to Ginger.  In any way,  shape,  or form.
<p></p>EDIT:  Just to be clear here,  I'm <em>not</em> speaking on Ginger's behalf.  He has completely different feelings on the matter.  I'm only saying how <em>I</em> feel.
