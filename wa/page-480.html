            I'm so glad that's not what I thought it was.
<p></p>Incidentally,  I was listening to Art of the Dress again,  and I'm shocked I never noticed just how different Rarity's singing actress's voice is from her speaking actress's.  Chalk it up to a bad ear,  I suppose.

            So,  uh.  I may have mentioned at some point I was working on a fanfic,  which I'll probably upload to fanfiction.net or something where the expectations won't be too high.  I'm currently facing a bit of a dilemma on the first chapter.  See,  the story has two major plotlines,  but I can't decide whether or not it's a good idea to use the second.  There are two major problems with it that might cause people to reject it.  However,  if I drop it,  I run into a problem because that plotline is the key to a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a> I need to influence a character's behavior in the first plotline,  and I just can't think of a good replacement.
<p></p>And,  dagnabbit,  I can't even talk about it in open forum without being so vague it makes me angry just to read what I've typed.  If anyone's willing to listen and give me advice on this,  can you send me a message?
<p></p>...ah,  I somehow managed to spend fifteen minutes typing this... hope that doesn't count as an interruption...

            I know I already said this earlier,  but the sentence "Looking at her friend,  Twilight was less than pleased to see that Rainbow Dash wasn't taking notes as much as she was drawing Applejack all over one page." was the cutest thing in that fanfic

Same here.  Some fans are way too anxious to share every last good joke out of context,  but I think the show only has the proper effect when seen in full.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Flutterguy is one of the first clips I saw of the show,  and is pretty much what sold me on giving it a shot. </div>
I think what convinced me Friendship Is Magic was unusual was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftvZFUg4HPc">Night Of Pony<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.  It really gets across how hyper-kinetic the style is.  I just wasn't expecting that kind of physical comedy in a cute Little Pony show.  I must have been thinking things like,  "Aww,  they're gonna try a little springboard trick... HA HA WHAT,  did Applejack just MISS and go SPLAT on the ground?"  You might as well just <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG8rcJIgBiI">end the scene right there<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>; you can't top that kind of punchline!  Then there was "Wow,  that purple pony just smacked that pink pony away!  She couldn't just shove her aside a little,  she had to freakin SMACK the pink one all the way off screen,  wow.  And then she smacks herself off the screen a few more times,  ha ha,  nice editing."
<p></p>Later I found <a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7uWBHrhX3M">this poop<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.  Some of the edits were so good,  I didn't realize what was edited,  like I thought that sick bird really did just stay in the bowl of soup and almost drown.  Given what I knew of Pinkie Pie,  I thought she might have been so shocked that she did just freeze in the air for a while and then fall to the ground like a statue.  Also,  "Wow,  did Pinkie Pie really eat a raw bird?  That seems a little extreme for this kind of show,  but they did tell me Pinkie was deranged..."
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> I should probably watch Bridle Gossip again some time. I didn't like it that much the first time around </div>
There was a discussion a few pages back that kept making me think back to "Bridle Gossip".  First of all,  people were saying that Twilight Sparkle was a total pessimist who always leaped to conclusions,  but doesn't that sound like a bit of an over-generalization?  At least in the scenes with Twilight and Spike,  the dynamic tends to be reversed: Twilight approaches new challenges with a smile and an open mind,  while Spike is the panicky pessimist putting everyone down.  From what I remember,  Twilight only goes into panic mode when it really does look like the end of the world as we know it.  And in "Bridle Gossip",  Twilight took plenty of time to form her opinion of Zecora,  wrong as it may have been,  rather than buying into what everybody else said right away.  I think Twilight Sparkle's biggest problem is not being Genre Savvy enough to know not to dismiss things that look silly on the surface,  as they often turn out to be the key to everything—like the book with the stupid pun title from the same episode,  or Pinkie Pie's instruments,  or "Make some friends!"
<p></p>(Now I wish I could be a little less Genre Savvy,  because right away I thought "The zebra didn't do anything to you,  it's the blue leaves she mentioned,  dummies!")
<p></p>I also like how "Bridle Gossip" is the one other episode where Pinkie Pie is proven wrong and gets her comeuppance.  "Party of One" was definitely more epic,  though,  since it was basically Pinkie Pie getting a taste of her own medicine and revealing her fragile psyche.
<p></p>I remember someone wondered if many ponies aren't given names until they display some of their main interests,  to explain why their cutie marks coincide with their names so often.  Well,  to my surprise,  I think one episode of My Little Pony Tales provided a clue,  in that the youngest member of Bon Bon's family was referred to simply as "Baby".

            I think the main reason that Twilight approached Zecora differently is her academic approach to everything.  She doesn't like to form opinions on anything unless it has some sort of basis; she had never even heard of Zecora before,  so she didn't buy her friend's explanation until she had a reason to do so.
<p></p>It's another example of how a single character trait can be both a virtue and a flaw; it keeps Twilight from making unfounded assumptions,  but it also trips her up when she tries to use that approach on more socially oriented matters.
<p></p>Anyway,  I think the Flutterguy reveal was the point where my opinion of the show went from "This is pretty good" to "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYjpE1I7XbE">so AWESOME<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>".  I mean,  I really enjoyed a few of the earlier episodes,  but that particular joke almost made me fall out of my chair. I think the thing is that it's a joke that is completely unaffected by age range; anybody can laugh at it.  And that's the great thing about the humor in the show.  It doesn't require you to pick up pop culture references or regress into childishness to be funny.
