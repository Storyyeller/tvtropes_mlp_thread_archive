            Im trying to get my boyfriend to let me get another tortoise... I had one but I couldnt keep it in the apartment we moved into when I first came down here so I had to give her away.  Now that we own a house I want to build a pen in the backyard and get a new turtle but he keeps grumbling about it.

            Well Missie,  that's what we've taken to calling her,  she has a sort of air of... I don't want to say arrogance. She carries herself around like Rarity in a lot of ways. Anyway she lives in the house with four humans and a dog,  but she only ever sleeps in my bed. Course I'm the only one who'd let her.

            My dog got his head stuck in a cinderblock once.  We put a piece of plywood across the hallway to keep him in the kitchen and used the block to hold it in place.  He figured out that he could stick his nose in the hole and move the block and escape.  Worked for months until the block fell over one time and his head got lodged in there.

            Yeah,  when he was younger my dog could climb over the grate doors in the back storage area of my house and climb through an opening.
<p></p>Unfortunately,  he also use to be a bit aggressive and got into one or two vicious scraps with other dogs. He's way more mellow now though. The neutering helped a little.

            Before I moved away from home,  I had three pets(The current count is down to 2,  though 2 of the originals were gone,  one of them just got replaced)
<p></p>I had two cats,  and a dog. Of the cats,  The one remaining is an incredible surly old bastard,  to everyone but me. He's still a surly bastard to me,  but he doesn't ever really <em>act</em> on any of his threats,  and he generally comes to me when he needs a moment of peace. the other one,  who died a year or so ago,  just sort of... showed up. We found him in our porch in the dead of winter,  so we let him into the kitchen to keep warm and he would. not. leave.
<p></p>We also had a dog who was probably the most even tempered soul I've ever met,  if incredibly neurotic. He would let you do <em>anything</em> to him without getting mad,  but he had this perpetually worried expression on his face,  and he had a schedule that things needed to be done on,  or he'd pretty much flip. And his anxiety manifested itself through licking. Everything. Hands,  feet,  the fridge,  the stove,  the floor,  the couch... everything. He died as well,  a while after the cat,  and my parents then replaced him with a third cat,  whom I've not met,  but I've heard is... odd. When I called my parents last they opened by saying,  "Oliver has learned how to fly,  now."

            You know those vacuum sealed containers of raw meat you get at the grocery store? [[Like this?]] Well mom used to take our Dog,  Bandit shopping with her. She'd buy some chicken in those containers,  leave it in the van then go on to the next store. Well one time she came back and she found one of these opened and the meat inside partially eaten. Apparently Bandit had used one of his claws like a letter opener and had opened up the package enough to get at the chicken. It should be stated that chicken is far-and-away Bandit's avorite food. Though he never tried this stunt again,  probablly because the meat doesn't taste as good when it's still frozen.

            I'm inclined to agree that Angel adopted Fluttershy and not the other way around. All of the other animals with her probably only stay as long as they need to.

            There are two dogs that roam around on my street. A white one and a brown one.
<p></p>They're actually really mellow and gentle-natured. They don't attack anyone,  but they do get into people's trash. The brown one seems a little enamoured of my house. Sometimes we have to shoo him away when the gate is open.
