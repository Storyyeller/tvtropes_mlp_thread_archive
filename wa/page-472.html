            They would probably restrict Unicorns to their basic telekinesis. Even if you consider magic to be a physical quality,  they'd still have to introduce limiters to make sure they're all doing the same thing - more advanced magic would probably be viewed as the same doing tricks,  or bringing in other physical disciplines. Although introducing acrobatics into basketball would be hilarious to watch.
<p></p>Unless,  of course,  they had unicorn specific sports or leagues.

            Magic,   spell magic.  They could use telekinesis (just like Rarity used in Winter Wrap Up).

            I think she was just cheating for the sake of cheating.  She's such a cheating cheater she kept cheating <em>after her victory was already guaranteed by virtue of having won more than half the events</em>.

            It also bothers me that she was counted as having won certain events - like the last one.  She went past the edge of the mud hole,  she should've lost even if she didn't land in the mud.

            Ain't no rule against using your wings in an Iron Pony competition.
<p></p>Also,  there's no rule that says a dragon can't incinerate the competition either.
<p></p>Surprisingly,  there are ashes in the rule book.  That is probably not related.

            My thought would be that they'd have separate leagues for different pony races; like a magic allowed league and a non=magic league.  Or just restrict the use of magic to certain circumstances.  Like in pony baseball they could have a rule that pegasi aren't allowed to fly around the bases,  or that unicorns can't use telekinesis on the ball.

            My idea that there are separate disciplines for pegasi,  earth pony and unicorn,  but also there ones for everypony with special balanced rules so every race will have fair change (it may be team sports).  And maybe they have not balanced sports where everypony do their best and can use all race perks.

            Yeah RD in Fall weather friends was a cheater to the absolute highest degree,  I still don't think AJ did anything THAT wrong,  especially with all the egregious cheating RD was pulling out of her ass.
<p></p>Anyone care to list the ways AJ cheated vs the ways RD cheated

<p></p>Pony sports are an interesting concept.  For some,  like baseball,  I can imagine having exclusively unicorns as pitchers,  unless some earth ponies or pegasi want to give themselves whiplash.

<p></p>How do ponies play instruments if they're not unicorns? especially guitars or other instruments that involve the fine manipulation of strings (it struck me because you guys were talking about how hard it would be for ponies to play a lot of our sports)

            It might have been a good way to show off the implied class structure a little more though,  with unicorns being the only ponies who can do highly intricate tasks that require a lot of fine precision. I mean it's obvious that unicorns are the superior race in equestria compared to earth ponies (I'm not saying that because i prefer unicorns,  I personally think that AJ is the most badass of the mane cast,  it's just what seems to be implied given what we've seen of the different races)

            I remember a couple of Generation 1 episodes actually dealt with sports,  one where an Earth pony had trouble finding a game to play when all the other kinds of ponies were playing games that required their special abilities,  and one where a sport had a rule against using unicorn magic.

I can usually fall back on "They're very dextrous and can stick tape to their hooves when you aren't looking",  but playing the piano concerns me.  HOW ARE YOU HITTING MORE THAN TWO KEYS AT THE SAME TIME?
