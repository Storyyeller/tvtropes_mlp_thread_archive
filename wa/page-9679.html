<p></p>This is why it's merely unlikely rather than impossible. The Apple family are traditionally late bloomers. If Fluttershy is much older than Applejack (or even slightly older) it greatly increases the likelihood of other pony's being extremely late bloomers which in turn makes it very unlikely that all the Apples we know weren't in the same class as others who got their cutie marks later than them. It's the model mot likely to give the data we've ended up with.
<p></p>As for Fluttershy dating Pony!Steve Irwin,  that does fit which is amusing as one of the <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCs" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCs">NP Cs</a> in our Pony RPG is partially based on Steve Irwin (not heavily,  but still).

<p></p>I don't really believe in Fluttermac.  Two shy and silent types usually makes for a lot of awkward silences.  But shy mixed with boisterous is cute. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_waii.png" height="16" width="16" alt="waii" title="waii">

            I had a really creepy case of disorientation/not being fully awake early this morning.  I woke up and made a trip to the bathroom.  My mind,  however,  was somehow typing out my thoughts and posting them in a chat room.  It took a minute for me to snap out of it.  When I did,  I was like,  "WTF just happened?"

I ended up sketching a circle where a word was supposed to be.
