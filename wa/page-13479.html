<p></p>Yeah,  my question is why they waited like a year and a half into a very well-known and high profile project and gave them the C&amp;D when they were in,  like,  beta.  I mean,  Jesus,  the main game was almost <em>done</em>.  It was in the works and halfway playable since before I joined this fandom.
<p></p>The lesson here,  of course,  is to not publicize fangames until they're complete.  Which is a really,  really sad reflection of US trademark law.

            I actually hope they don't release what they have now. I'm pretty sure that leaking it after they received the C&D would land them in some <em>real</em> hot legal trouble.

            I'm guessing what happened is that whoever it was at Hasbro initially thought they could get away with letting the game under the radar. Yeah,  it's been in production for a while,  but it hasn't been until the past few months that it really started getting serious press. Basically once it got big enough that it was nearly featured at EVO and has serious gaming news sites reporting on it,  it was too big for Hasbro to pretend that they didn't know about it.
<p></p>In short,  Hasbro was turning a blind eye on it,  but it basically got too popular to the point where Hasbro couldn't get away with it anymore.

            The other thing that confuses me is that they pick out this,  and MLP Online (to date the only <em>good</em> RPG I've seen),  and a couple of the most promising ones,  but don't just C&amp;D everything on Equestria Gaming.  I mean,  they break trademark just as badly and also make no profit.

            You know,  I've been thinking on what Hasbro wants to accomplish with this "new IP" that's suppose to appeal to teenage girls and up.
<p></p>Some action shows,  which are normally targeted at teenage boys,  suffer because <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">they don't sell enough toys</a> (or just <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a>,  but that's a different thread). I know I stopped being interested in Star Wars,  Batman,  and Transformers toys by the time I hit High School,  but I still watched action shows at the time and am still interested in those franchises. I don't know how many teens,  particularly young teen girls (that's probably what Hasbro is aiming for),  are interested in buying toys unless they're on the path to becoming avid collectors. Surely a big toy company like Hasbro knows how hard it is to make a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise Driven</a> "teen" show.
<p></p>Consider this from the investor announcement.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">We did a tremendous amount of research,  and our consumer insights told us that girls want more ways to play with My Little Pony and more ways to experience My Little Pony,  so we’ve developed a brand new expression of My Little Pony—an entirely new IP—that will appeal to slightly older girls and give them an even “cooler” way to play with My Little Pony. </div>
<p></p>Hasbro is looking for <em>new</em> ways for people to experience ponies,  and they've apparently been doing research. What are they <em>not</em> doing now that they could do in the future to make money?
<p></p>I was thinking what Hasbro could do with My Little Pony that would still fit the franchise while appealing to teenagers,  and then there I was waiting for my order at Dairy Queen when it hit me.

The potential spin-off series would follow their various misadventures as traveling musicians. Sapphire Shores is <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor">The Mentor</a>. Lyra,  Octavia,  and Vinyl Scratch may or may not have minor roles (I don't see Hasbro giving background ponies their own spin-off...then again...). Maybe they fight villains with <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfRock" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfRock">The Power of Rock</a>,  and the first season finale is a Battle of the Bands with Discord. But wait,  there's more!
<p></p>You can buy their actual music CD's! Fake band with real music,  think <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz">Gorillaz</a> with ponies! They'll have music videos,  instruments,  and some token toys cause its Hasbro. The Equestria Girls toyline could even be music themed! Singing dolls &amp; playsets,  pony themed music players. And concerts! They'll go on tour coming to a city near YOU! Maybe they'll even open for other fake bands like <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz">Gorillaz</a>!
<p></p><em>Imagine it!</em> An entire music-themed sub-franchise for <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a>! <em>Friendship is Magic</em> already has <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMusic" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMusic">Awesome Music</a>,  why not take it a step further?

            @Pykrete: That's because all the smaller games aren't popular enough to justify a C&D.  The reason FIM and MLP Online got hammered is specifically due to the quality: the high quality means they got a <em>lot</em> of attention,  which in turn resulted in a the C&amp;D.  The crap games don't get hit because they don't threaten the trademark.
<p></p>@Calnos: That's an interesting idea,  but there's one <em>enormous</em> flaw: Teenage girls are <em>not</em> renowned for having good taste in music.  The odds of them going to the trouble of actually making <em>good</em> music is incredibly slim. If they do go that route it'll almost certainly be tween pop stuff.  You know,  the variety of music that pretty much everyone who isn't a girl in the 8-13 age group avoids like the plague. If they got some legit musicians together for a real artistic endeavor it could be good,  but the chance of that happening is almost nil.
<p></p>Anyway,  let's distract everyone from the drama with <a class="urllink" href="http://derpibooru.org/237407">this.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
