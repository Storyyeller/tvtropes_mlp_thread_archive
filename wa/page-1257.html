            <div class="quoteblock"> It probably won't happen,  but I really hope that the next episode includes a scene of Rarity coming out of her boutique in some absurdly elaborate costume only to realize that she's like a week late. </div>
Eh,  yeah,  if Rarity's scene was cut for time,  I doubt they'll find time in other episodes to <em>add</em> a scene just for a continuity gag.  This show doesn't really address continuity so much as it says "Well that thing from that one episode was neat,  let's throw it in one more time!"

            That's why I said it probably won't happen.  It would be hilarious,  but the show generally doesn't do those sorts of jokes.

            You know,  while watching the episode,  around the time that Luna said that Nightmare Night was cancelled forever and it showed all the other townsponies being upset I got to thinking that more than just Applejack and Rarity had siblings or kids in Ponyville. For instance,  I think the princess filly and Green Grapes (colt wearing a mustache,  toboggan hat,  and a shark attached to his rump) are related in some way,  like brother/sister,  father/daughter.

            Man... After waiting for it all day,  and the download borking <em>twice</em>,  I <em>finally</em> managed to watch the episode... and it was worth. The. Wait.
<p></p>Seriously. Fantastic. I love Hammy Luna,  and awkward/earnest Luna too. The last episode had some stuff I wasn't sure about,  but I think I loved every bit of this one. Well,  except for Pinkie cocking everything up - but hey,  it certainly balances her character out a bit more. They even brought Zecora back! I bet after being the object of fear for years,  she's rarin' to go for Nightmare Night. Her magic was pretty sweet,  too.
<p></p>I wonder if anyone's made a list of all the shout-out costumes in the background yet? I know that I saw at least one or two.

<p></p>They do show up (Applebloom is Frankenstien's bride,  Scootaloo is a wolf,  Sweetie Belle is cutest vampire),  they just never speak. They and Dinky only really show up in large crowd shots of the kids,  otherwise its Pipsqueak and the other three girls.

            For some reason I picture RD with a goldfish. But her pet would probably have to fly,  considering she lives in a house in the clouds. So some kind of bird? A bat?

            I like to think the reason Luna was socially clueless was because she spent 98% of her absence last season in a regenerative coma and just woke up before Nightmare Night.
<p></p>And after Luna cancelled Nightmare Night,  the Cutie Mark Crusaders were probably gearing up to become the CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS CANDY CHAMPIONS until Twilight <em>et al</em> resolved the problem.
