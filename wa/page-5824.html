            I generally prefer starting with a concept and building the character around it.
<p></p>Granted,  sometimes the concept is mechanics based,  like "a character of this race should not play this class,  but does",  which led me to the half-orc wizard.
<p></p>^ Someone would mind about slogging through something they don't feel like reading. Plus,  I think it's more organized to have a split thread for this.
