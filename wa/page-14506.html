            Whether or not Magic Kindergarten is a thing is kinda insubstantial.  There <em>must</em> be some sort of "intro to magic" class for unicorns,  it's just a question of what it's called.
<p></p>And I never went through all the stereotypical high school shenanigans either. Granted,  I went to a private school,  but it was pretty similar to a public school in most respects aside from the fact that the teachers weren't idiots.  Mostly.

            Okay,  sure,  I'll procrastinate on my high school English essay to talk about high school. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>Yeah,  high school is nowhere near as terrible as every cartoon makes it out to be. I guess a lot of writers/ animators were bullied or something?
<p></p>Although I also think it's because real high school is too "hardcore"/ too boring/ actually sorta complex for a child audience. Lots of sex,  mild drug use,  drinking,  tests,  relationships,  petty drama,  coming of age,  ect. When captured correctly,  it's actually can be pretty interesting— at least for someone like me,  who loves seeing how people tick.
<p></p>Really,  it's middle school that's the nightmarish one. No one prepared me for that hell hole.

            I've only been a direct witness/ heard second hand from my strange web of friends many of the things mentioned above. So I had many views on the same stories with varying embellishments and biases,  while I usually stayed quiet and neutral in the matter.

            @JT:  I await with bated breath whatever minor thing from season 4 will throw everyone into a huff.  Probably Gilda coming back or something,  because God forbid the writers reuse a character so they can build on them and make them deeper,  that would be pandering.

            @Crow: Even though I don't like Gilda much,  I'd be all for it. Then again,  if I had my way,  S4 wouldn't have <em>any</em> new characters and would focus more on developing existing secondary characters.
