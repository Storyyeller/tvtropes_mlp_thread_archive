            Whether or not Magic Kindergarten is a thing is kinda insubstantial.  There <em>must</em> be some sort of "intro to magic" class for unicorns,  it's just a question of what it's called.
<p></p>And I never went through all the stereotypical high school shenanigans either. Granted,  I went to a private school,  but it was pretty similar to a public school in most respects aside from the fact that the teachers weren't idiots.  Mostly.

            Okay,  sure,  I'll procrastinate on my high school English essay to talk about high school. <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">
<p></p>Yeah,  high school is nowhere near as terrible as every cartoon makes it out to be. I guess a lot of writers/ animators were bullied or something?
<p></p>Although I also think it's because real high school is too "hardcore"/ too boring/ actually sorta complex for a child audience. Lots of sex,  mild drug use,  drinking,  tests,  relationships,  petty drama,  coming of age,  ect. When captured correctly,  it's actually can be pretty interestingâ€” at least for someone like me,  who loves seeing how people tick.
<p></p>Really,  it's middle school that's the nightmarish one. No one prepared me for that hell hole.

            I've only been a direct witness/ heard second hand from my strange web of friends many of the things mentioned above. So I had many views on the same stories with varying embellishments and biases,  while I usually stayed quiet and neutral in the matter.

            @JT:  I await with bated breath whatever minor thing from season 4 will throw everyone into a huff.  Probably Gilda coming back or something,  because God forbid the writers reuse a character so they can build on them and make them deeper,  that would be pandering.

            @Crow: Even though I don't like Gilda much,  I'd be all for it. Then again,  if I had my way,  S4 wouldn't have <em>any</em> new characters and would focus more on developing existing secondary characters.
