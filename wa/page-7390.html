            that it's pretty much legendary as one of the most well known and read pony fanfics I guess.
<p></p>also Re: the mane 6's fate,  yeah AJ got the best one,  though you still haven't seen Fluttershy's and Rarity's yet,  and we never get a for sure scene where we fond out Dash's,  the last time we see anything with her it's more of a <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding">Bolivian Army Ending</a>,  but nothing for sure.
<p></p>Oh and while AJ got the best,  you know Rarity at least would consider hers a good death.

            -Shudder- Rarity's fate is the worst of all. And the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she did it willingly and happily</span> makes it even worse.
