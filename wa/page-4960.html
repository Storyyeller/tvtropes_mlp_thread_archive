            @Light: A bit of warning right now: I have that game on Virtual Console,  and I can tell you that it will try your patience greatly. Most of this game's faults are what happens when you give Bomberman poorly-implemented jump mechanics.

            @Ginger: That's because there's a difference between competent and broken.  I don't know anything about Schneizel and little about R2,  but if Light had had the Shinigami Eyes and a little less hubris,  there would have been no way for him to lose.  The villains have to have some flaws or they're not believable characters,  and getting outmaneuvered by someone who's <em>more</em> competent doesn't mean they're <em>not</em> competent.

            @Red You're right,  but a lot of the time,  the way a villain is defeated ends up undermining them and making them look pathetic. There has to be a balance

            Also,  Live A Live's stories are pretty nice romps through various settings. They're all tied together by the central villain,  but there's also good standalone stores as well.
<p></p>Osias. Save it to your computer,  resize it to at most 350 pixels in width,  and then [[tvtropes.org/pmwiki/uploadform.php upload]] it.

            @osias: In order to link an image right into the forum,  you have to upload it first with the Image Uploader.  If you just want to link an image,  use this format: [[http://www.linkgoeshere.com text you want to make a link]].  Be sure to leave a space between the end of the link and the start of the text.
