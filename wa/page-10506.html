            @Sereg So if this is their written language,  then why haven't we seen in anywhere else ever? What writing we have seen has either been A: perfectly legible English,  B: normal cartoon scribbles,  or C: slightly warped characters that can still be recognized as English.
<p></p>Also,  I seriously doubt that those stone forms of the Elements were <em>carved</em>. They were most likely simply their dormant state.

<p></p>That's the equivalent of demanding that words be carved in gothic font. On a rounded surface. In stone.

            @ Sereg: And? These are the most powerful artefacts in the world. I find it hard to believe that no effort was put into their making if they were in fact even carved. Judging by the intro they were originally in another form before turning into another form.

<p></p><em>Originally</em> they represented concepts. They'd eventually form a natural alphabet. This isn't uncommon.

            Question for you all. Name any episodes that you really liked but still think they could have used some improvement.
<p></p>For me,  I love the season two finale,  but I think that we should have gotten a scene after Chrysalis was defeated with the rest of the mane 4 apoligizing to Twilight {We only got AJ apoligizing to her on-screen}. Don't get me wrong,  they had every right to be mad at her after they thought she caused Candance to cry,  but after Twilight was proven to be right....... I'm sure they did apoligize,  it just would have been nice to see it happen. {That's not even getting into how ovbiously shoe-horned into the show Candance and Shinning Armor were,  but that's a diffrent compliant anyway <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_tongue.png" height="16" width="16" alt="tongue" title="tongue">}
<p></p>Also,  I liked It's About Time,  but I think they could have handled some parts better {I.E,  Not repeating the whole scene where Twilight meets her future self}.

If it weren't for the cutie mark,  I might have guessed that was a ponified Jasmine instead of a cosplaying Rarity.

<p></p>Um,  they do,  but I'm assuming that that's their original form.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">B: Rarity an unremarkable unicorn has a spell that can shape wood into sculptures,  it is not unlikely that a Unicorn who's special talent is carving or masonry would not have a spell that can carve,  that is the point I was getting at.

<p></p>A: <em>When did Rarity do this?</em>
<p></p>B: I'm not denying that magic was involved or that they may have been made by non-mortals. I'm just saying that them simplifying isn't a mark against them when not doing so would result in needless complication,  especially as simplification is often done for asthetic reasons (see minimalism). Not to mention the fact that the symbol relies on being multi-coloured means that they had to do some simplification anyway.

            her topiary spell. And there is just far to much variety for each CM to have been thought up at some point by one group of ponies and each one to be part of a hieroglyphic language. If that was true then nopony could have a CM based on something those ponies never thought of or encountered.

            @Sereg Here's another problem I have with a "marks = symbol" system. What about marks that depict objects that would logically be predated by said written language,  like telescopes?

            It's <em>purpose</em> isn't language. It just works <em>like</em> a language and cutie marks that represent certain things sometmes have that symbol used elsewhere. I believe that the <em>first</em> case of a specific talent has a symbol decided by the pony that earned it which is then standardised. It's pretty magical,  but we know that about cutie marks already.
<p></p>Cutie marks that have modern symbols just represent modern talents.

            With all this discussion on Cutie Marks,  it's going to be interesting to see what the Crusaders' Cutie Marks will look like when they finally get them!
<p></p>You know that old pony named Mr. Greenhooves? He doesn't have a Cutie Mark. He probably never discovered his purpose in life or his special talent. I bet the Crusaders look at him,  imagine themselves as old and not having any CM,  and then panic! <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_evilgrin.png" height="16" width="16" alt="evil grin" title="evil grin">

            Still far far to much variety in them for them to all conform to one system,  I'm sticking with the CM is based on what that pony best identified,  if even unconsciously,  as a symbol for their purpose once they discover what it is.

            I think it basically comes down to how you interpret what you see in the show.  I personally think the most logical way of interpreting it is simply that each CM is simply based on the pony who gets it and their interpretation thereof because it's the simplest explanation that's consistent with what we see in the show.  Not that Sereg's interpretation is <em>wrong</em> but I feel like it really overcomplicates the process for no real reason.  It's possible that each CM has a specific meaning,  but nothing in the show indicates that,  so I see no reason to assume it's the case.
