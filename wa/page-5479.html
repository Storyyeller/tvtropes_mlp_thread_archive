<p></p>I've found that this happens with every game. Actually,  I've even had dreams about this thread.
<p></p>By the way,  does anyone have tips on how to feel sleepy and fall asleep quickly?

            Best trick I've found is to find something really simple to focus on (bonus points if you can focus on nothing,  but it takes a bit to be able to do that). The key to falling asleep i just relaxation,  so anything that'll help you relax is good. Once you get that sort of fuzzy-headed feeling,  focus on that. OR maybe don't. I don't know,  by that point you're not really in a position to focus on anything.

            Yeah relaxation is the key. However,  my way of relaxing is to pretty much me shutting down my thought process and let my mind sink into oblivion. Sleep follows shortly afterwords.

            If that illustration for Cutie Pox was supposed to be Cadence,  it's not a very good likeness of her: The shape of her hair is different,  the shape of her face is different,  the shape of her eye is different—no corners!  So the side-by-side comparison actually makes me doubt it.

            So I finally got to watch "Hurricane Fluttershy."
<p></p>I was surprised.  Lately we've been getting a stream of clunkers,  with "Dragon Quest" being the worst episode since Discord.  And then "Hurricane Fluttershy" was actually GOOD.

            @Dantes: Not so much bad episodes as episodes that don't live up to our rising expectations,  I should think.
