            Discworld is one part light and one part dark. On the one hand,  Pterry loves his punes,  or plays on words,  a little too much. On the other hand,  the Disc is so fleshed-out and well-described you could practically find your way around once you got familiar with the place. Also it gets better. Death and City Watch arc books are excellent,  and the Moist arc introduced recently is pretty interesting because the protagonist is a shameless scoundrel and a confidence trickster and a fraud and a snappy dresser. The Tiffany arc books,  while a bit oriented to younger audiences,  has a dark side to it that makes it a great read.
<p></p>Overall,  I'd recommend the series.
<p></p>But enough Discworld,  we need more ponies! Especially the Scootalove episode!
<p></p>@Ginger: That's a reasonable view,  because sometimes the universe (or even multiverse!) is simply too vast for a single person to comprehend. Anyways if Twi insists that Unicorn Magic is practically a science,  I'm not gonna say otherwise because she probably has done papers to prove it and such.

<p></p>You were fine with Sisterhooves Social,  despite the fact that it involved Sweetie Belle and her sister.
<p></p>Your complaint was that you think the WRITERS need to give Scoots something to do outside of the crusaders and RD. All that had been established before Sisterhooves was that Sweetie hung out with the crusaders and idolized her sister. You didn't complain that they were going to be focusing on something already established about her back when they announced that episode.

In fact it was one of my favorite episodes.
<p></p>But this Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo to be honest I am just absolutely terrified at the prospect them being together in an episode. Mostly because the likelihood of Scootabuse being vindicated in someway is fairly high.

            Hm... if the contraption uses a "Divination-class spell" to detect good/bad apples,  then...
<p></p>Does that mean you can pre-program a spell on to stuff,  and you only need to supply it with raw magical energy to activate it? Except,  for it to work for more than a couple of seconds,  it'll need a steady stream of energy. But Flim and Flam only gave the contraption a short zap to get it started.
<p></p>They must be using some sort of magic-supplying reactor or engine,  and the zap they gave it is the starter that gets it running. But then,  where does the magic come from? A reactor/engine still needs fuel.
<p></p>The next logical step is... ... ...is beyond me.

            @Kyler:  The idea is that energy for Unicorn system spells is forced into a particular "shape"to get a specific spell. A perma-burned spell would be like an etched circuit ROM that casts the same spell as energy is fed into it.
<p></p>As to how it stays powered,  I think the Brothers pump a sizeable charge into it,  enough power to last a good long while.

Then we will never hear the end of it from fans
<p></p>On the other hoof Dash could just be plain dismissive of Scootaloo and that would probably be enough to. Maybe we will even get a cynical message on how we should put so much stock in our idols because they are not be who they seem.
<p></p>Look I know this is all pretty irrational but I can't get them out of my head.

            so,  odd question I've been wondering about but keep forgetting to ask,  assuming we're talking using American conventions where-by Cider =/= Inherently alcoholic,  what's the differnce between Apple Cider,  and Apple Juice?

            Yup,  that's what I thought. I'd seen a similar concept before,  in <em><a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalesOfTheQuestor" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalesOfTheQuestor">Tales of the Questor</a></em>.
<p></p>But... it's a huge machine. Even with the two of them,  I would imagine powering the contraption really ought to be a significant strain (especially if you mean for it to run for a full hour). But they hardly even broke a sweat!

            About the "Cutie Mark Crusader Babysitters" thing,  that would be a hilarious disaster,  even more than it was for Pinkie.  Also,  remember that since Apple Bloom was helping with the farm,  she wouldn't be there,  so it would just be Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle.  First of all,  Scootaloo probably would get into racing with Pound Cake and they would probably trash the store knocking things down.  Or she would just get angry at them as they didn't listen to her and played around.  However,  she'd probably be good at thinking up entertaining games for them to play,  even if said games also ended up trashing the store.
<p></p>Sweetie Belle,  on the other hand,  would try to bake something for the Cakes or for the babies and end up making as big a mess of that as she did in Sisterhooves Social.  Or else she would try to sing the babies to sleep but she'd sing her loud lullaby and it would just make them more active and want to dance to it.
<p></p>Basically,  I'd like to see that potential story! (considering I liked Baby Cakes so much,  it would probably be even funnier with the Cutie Mark Crusaders)
<p></p>Speaking of Sweetie Belle,  I was thinking of Rarity's kids (in relation to my next-gen fanfic idea) and thought that Rarity really would either need to babyproof her store or have an addition where the kids and potential spouse would live (or a separate house next door) so that the babies wouldn't be underhoof all the time.  Especially if they were unicorn babies and were at all like Pumpkin Cake.  Rarity had enough trouble keeping Sweetie Belle from accidentally messing things up,  and baby foals would be even more trouble,  if Pumpkin Cake was any indication.

            @Kyler: we never get to see the internals of the squeezy so for all I know they have a concealed mana battery inside it.
<p></p>Edit: I recently saw more work by that artist:rainbow guy who did the somewhat unsettling Gamma Delta pet_pony art,  and he's eased off on the creepy,  in the latest piece she's no longer frightened,  actually has had a manecut,  and is actually posing happily for a sketch.

            The jolt is an ignition charge to start the reaction,  I should think. The engine might run on something like thaumic combustion so it needs a bit of a kickstart.
