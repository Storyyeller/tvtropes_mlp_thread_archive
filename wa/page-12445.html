            was Magic Duel's use of the word "alicorn" the first use of that word
in the My Little Pony animated canon?
The first use in <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiM">Fi M</a>?
the first use at all? (toys, comics etc ?)
<p></p>also:
If the blasted thing is so dangerous,  how did a curio-shopkeeper get it? (a fair question about a lo of things of course)
<p></p>Is there only one ? Can more be made ?
(if the answer to either of these is "yes", then obviously it takes some of the conspiracy theory/hostile

<p></p>Finally:Age spells are more difficult than turning mice into horses? More difficult even than apple into oranges? I'm beginning to suspect that Twilight is like a lot of physics grad students who can do calculus in their heads but are a bit slow on the uptake for arithmetic.
Hmm. Mass of horse&gt;mass of mouse. Mass of apple~=mass of orange. Mass of young person &lt;=mass of older person (typically).
Maybe conjuring mass is easy,  but banishing it is hard?

<p></p>They made a point in TMPP of the orange conversion spell being at the <em>very edge</em> of Twilight's ability. She couldn't get it to work on an apple,  and the accidental uses on the animals were decidedly incomplete. The mice-&gt;horse abominations were noted to be completely temporary,  and even then they didn't turn out like she had planned. Age spells are a much more serious matter,  since they didn't appear to have drawbacks or time limits,  and can theoretically grant immortality as well as outright kill something.

            My guess about the amulet is simply that the shopkeeper knew it was <em>kinda</em> dangerous,  but didn't realize the degree. I mean,  he obviously never tried it himself. He just went "okay,  that looks ominous" and made an educated guess about its nature.
<p></p>As for the spells,  I have a few theories:
<p></p>1. Mice turning into horses is a common fairy-tale thing,  so maybe there was a pre-designed spell that Twilight was using for that.
<p></p>2. Casting spells on stuff like frogs and mice is easier than casting spells on ponies because ponies are naturally magical.  Animals and fruit are mundane,  but ponies have a magical aura that interferes with spells which change their biology.  Ponies could have a sort of built-in magical spell resistance to magic that physically modifies them.  I.e. age spells are difficult not due to modifying the target's biology,  but because when you're casting a spell on a pony,  they have their own magic that has to be accounted for to enable the spell to work,  and making that compensation is the hard part.  To de-age Snips and Snails,  you not only have to get the biology right,  but you'd have to accommodate their own magic on the fly as you're performing the spell.
