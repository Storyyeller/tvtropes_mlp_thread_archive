            @Lurker: They are good. So better then others,  but nothing to makes it stand out.  They are really good character pieces...when the moral isn't getting in the way. I didn't even know their would be a moral ep in ep 11 so I felt tacked on. I think it would be better as a whole with out the "today I learned X" bit at the end. Let the episode speak for its self instead of telling us war it was suppose to teach us (Show don't tell).

            @van The letters at the end are a result of the E/I rating the show had in its first season. It was more or less forced to spell things out like that. It starts mixing things up a bit in the second season,  though it doesn't do away with the letters entirely. I do agree that the letters are usually my least favorite part of the show when they're played perfectly straight. The fact that they're so routine and somewhat forced actually gets lampooned in an early fan-favorite season 2 episode.

            <span class="blue">@Vanthebaron: I kind of agree.  I don't think MLP does anything revolutionary,  it's just a good cartoon with above average writing and excellent characters.  I agree that the morals just get in the way much of the time,  but since the show no longer has the IE designation I have hopes that that will change.  It has already in season 2,  though not to the extent that I'd hoped.</span>

Though yeah there are some episodes that it gets shoehorned in awkwardly,  but more most it just feels right and natural to the plot.
