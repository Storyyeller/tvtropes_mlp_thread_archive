            If this show goes longer than 3 seasons,  I really hope they actually let RD join the Wonderbolts at some point.
<p></p><div class="quoteblock"> Where would Rainbow Dash's loyalty lie with if given the choice to join the Thunderbolts? The real ones I mean. </div>
<p></p>Assuming you meant Wonderbolts,  I don't see how it would be an issue.  She can still remain friends with the others and belong to the team.  Even if they live in Canterlot,  she flies fast enough she could visit Ponyville anytime she wanted.  Plus,  there's a train,  so the others can visit her too.  And Twilight is supposed to move back home eventually.

            @ Ginger,  RD is the <em>fastest</em> flier,  that's it,  speed. She's not the best flier,  any of the Wonderbolts could most likely fly rings around her.
<p></p>Everypony is the best at something,  or one of a small umber that would be the best.  It's not just the mane 6,  once a pony decides what there special talent is,  they basicly become a savant at it,  that goes for everypony,  not just the ones we see. RD is a great natural flier,  and the fastest pegasi alive.
<p></p>AJ is one of the best farmers in Equestria (which by the way makes her rodeo showing even more impressive since you gotta figure she was competing against at least a few ponies who's special talent WAS the rodeo events they were doing)
<p></p>It's not just a few,  every single pony pretty much has some skill they are a natural prodigy at,  something they can do better then any other pony pretty much. And more importantly,  what ever it is they are best at,  is also what they love doing the most,  so no reason to really be upset pony A is better at X then pony B when pony B wouldn't care about being able to do X in the first place cause they are happy being the best at Y

            Hmm... I just read an interesting WMG that Princess Cadence will make an appearance in this episode,  since (apparently),  Faust originally intended her to be a pegasus. It would kind of fit.... Hmmm...
<p></p>Oh,  I meant the whole Pony A,  Ability X thing. Sorry,  my brain is dead today. It's a Monday and I have a 5-6 page essay to write and only 3 pages down. Why did I take so many writing courses in one semester?

            @ apple It's under debate,  some sciency types argue she does,  mostly due to her forming a mach cone around herself BEFORE the boom,  they looked at the shape and size relative to her and a mach cone like that would mean she's traveling at about mach 5. Then they computed that her spedd before and after boom was doubled,  so..mach 10
<p></p>all depends on if the Mach Cone was real,  or <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule Of Cool</a> <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense">Artistic License</a>
