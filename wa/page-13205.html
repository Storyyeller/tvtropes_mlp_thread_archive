            "Green Isn't Your Color" doubles not only as one of the worst Fluttershy episodes, but also one of the worst Rarity episodes. I'm sorry but all the complaints about "Look Before You Sleep" apply better here. Namely "too girly", uninteresting premise, and very predictable, and I'm sorry but even Pinkie wasn't that funny.
<p></p>"Hurricane Fluttershy" was very relatable, had a good <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks">Hard Work Hardly Works</a> thing going for it and didn't sugarcoat it.It was in my top ten, until the Scootaloo episode proved to be even better.

            Rarity wasn't really any more girly in "Green Isn't Your Color" than in any other episode.  Just because the revolves around a stereotypically "girly" subject (fashion) doesn't really make the episode any worse on it's own.  Honestly,  I found the premise pretty interesting,  because it allowed for something of a four-way conflict between characters who all had each others' best interests in mind,  but were still butting heads. I really like the fact that it was a conflict based episode that didn't have to make any character a jerkass to get the plot to work.  Not to mention that Photo Finish was pretty much made of win.
<p></p>As for relatability,  I relate most to Twilight,  mainly because I handle stress only marginally better than she does.  I have a similar tendency to hold myself to higher standards than I actually need to,  which only compounds my stress.

            Seriously,  AJ? That's a really shoddy excuse,  all right. Who wrote this episode? -checks- Ooh,  this is going to be good,  all right.

            @Terl: I think GIYC shows a <em>lot</em> of character material.  Namely,  what Fluttershy and Rarity are willing to endure for their friends. Fluttershy <em>hates</em> being in the spotlight,  but she goes with the modelling job because she thinks Rarity wants it.  Rarity is hugely jealous of Fluttershy (and like Story points out,  she realizes it herself),  but actively fights those feelings because Fluttershy is more important to her than to her own success.  Yeah,  that particular element of her character doesn't get as much press is it does in Sisterhooves Social,  but it's also a vastly different set of circumstances.

            I don´t udnerstand where this notion of fashion as being "girl" comes from. Fashion industry its a sever male dominated world where women are seeing as nothing more as objects. The few female designers had to wrok really hard to get respect. If you have seen Ratatouille replace in Colette speech the word "cook" with "designer" and you get the idea.
<p></p>Spike at your Service its one of my favourite episode for how funny it was. All this talk about character derailment mankes no sense. Spike entire cahracter revolves around him tripping and falling all over the place. Being klumsy is part of his character.
<p></p>And Green Isn´t your color was a really funny episode altought I liked Fluttershy in Stare Master better.

<p></p>Damn it,  Spike,  at least snap her out of her reading and break the news. You have been her assistance for god knows how,  and you don't even know that? Damn it.
<p></p>I am honestly thinking of dropping this episode.
<p></p>Ah,  Rarity. Why you so kind.
