            <em>I wonder what Equestrian equivalent of Scandinavia would be.</em>
<p></p>Well,  I've worldbuilt for a few stories some other countries. One of them was Furheim,  which I've ostensibly developed as part Scandanavia,  part Germany. Also Acmippo,  an all-pegasi,  <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Proud Warrior Race</a> country that's part generic Barbarian and part Ancinet Greece. For Irony.
<p></p>I have been considering developing another country above Furheim that would be wholly Scandanavian(Leaving Furheim pure Germany),  but I'd be hardpressed to know what to call it(I prefer to avoid pony puns where I can) or what it's patron would be(All of the countries in my fanon have patron deities. Equestria are Celestia and Luna,  Acmippo has the goddess of the sky,  and her sons,  the Gods of Wind and Thunder and her daughter who's currently mortal but will eventually ascend to be the goddess of Lightning[my views on divinity are complicated],  etc).

            I'd imagine you could play it that way rather plausibly if the hate comes from the pony they're trying to feed off of.

            Mmm... Interesting notion. IT might be,  but since they still consciously take foo(I think) they could just choose not to 'eat' it.
<p></p>...although,  since they gain power from love,  and love and hate are ultimately very similar,  maybe Hate could unlock a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a>. They get extra power via extra obsession,  but it's poisonous,  so they can never eat too much of it or it'll rot them.
<p></p>Ooh,  there's a thought: What if Chrys's hive has eaten hate before in desperate times,  and that's why they look the way they do? Other changeling's might be kinder,  and so get love freely,  and look less evil? The Selgie to the Changeling's Unselgie.

            Well,  we <em>do</em> know that hate is just as much of a valid source of magical power as love. Who knows how the whole thing works biologically,  though.

            Oh. Hm. You may have a point...
<p></p>Still,  you could easily get around it by not having it correlate exactly to goodness,  but rather what the individual hives are willing to do. Like,  the Selgie changelings could all be absolute bastards,  but simply not <em>have</em> to resort to feeding on hate. They could be arrogant because they know everyone loves them,  or they could use a Glamour spell to <em>make</em> people love them. The Unselgie changelings,  meanwhile,  would have no choice to feed on hate because it's all that's given to them at times.
<p></p>Obviously,  this would ultimately be on a changeling-by-changeling basis. My own fanon is actually that it's the queen who acquires all the food(Although there are soldiers/workers that find food but send it to her),  and she distributes it via a connection ot the hive. So regardless of how each individual changeling is on a personal level,  their appearance comes down to their Queen and the public opinion of her.

<p></p>I'm of the opinion that it's a really inefficient food source compared to love. Like trying to live on bread and water. and it also doesn't taste that great.

            time for another fanfic report! and it's rather appropriate for the current discussion,  as it has some changeling fanon!
<p></p><div class="quoteblock">Dear Thread Manor...
<p></p>I have a few more changeling stories today! but this time,  it's about changeling who love ponies for real. Then we have kinda of a sad Pinkie fic,  and finally some sheer absurdity with RD.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/26192/mendacity">Mendacity<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Bon Bon and Lyra are two poines that love eachother very much and would do anything eachother. Well,  that's only kind of true,  as Bon Bon isn't a pony. She's a changeling. She's done her best these past 20 years to distance herself from other changelings,  the Unseelie Court,  and all things Fae,  just so that she can live peacefully with Lyra,  but it seems fate has other things in store for her. When she hears word of changelings preparing an invasion on Canterlot,  she goes to Canterlot to try and warn someone. However,  when she returns home,  she finds that Lyra's been taken by the changelings. Now it's up to her and a supremely snarky kelpie who Bon Bon wishes would just go away to go to Canterlot and do whatever they can to prevent this mess and save Lyra.
<p></p>This fic was notable in that it takes changelings and goes full on 100% <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> with them. Complete with vulnerabilities to iron and time being wonky in the <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfFaerie" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfFaerie">Land of Faerie</a>. I'd recommend it for that alone.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/22618/flitter">Flitter<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Morning Rain and Swift Star have lived in Canterlot for years,  married,  even raised a colt and saw him move out. But this peaceful existence is shattered when changelings invade Canterlot and Swift Star,  real name Flitter,  finds himself blasted out of Canterlot like all the other changelings,  the form he's held for so long dispelled and lost forever because you can't copy the form of a pony that's been dead for years. Fortunately,  their love proves true and Morning Rain stays with him. Now they have to decide what to do,  about Flitters own hive (which was not the one that attacked Canterlot),  about how they're going to break this to their son,  and finally,  about each other.
<p></p>This one was ok,  not as good as mendacity but it would be hard to beat that. Still has some pretty neat fanon for changelings.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/49829/what-is-a-name">What is a Name<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>- in progress. Pinkie Pie,  while in the Everfree,  is struck with a magical malady,  an aetheric amnesia that has caused to mind to revert to her state as she was back on the rock farm,  before the sonic rainboom. It's so severe she's even lost her cutie mark. Pinkamena Diane Pie knows nothing about Ponyville,  has no idea who these 5 other mares claiming to be her best friends are,  and certainly has no idea how to spread joy and laughter to others. Twilight and the others are going to do everything they can to help her out,  but since this magical disease was thought to be a myth until now,  it won't be easy.
<p></p>This is an interesting one. rock farm pinkie trying to amke friends again even though the only existence she's known dull and listless to the point of being unbearable.
<p></p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/47730/rainbow-dash-and-the-ultimate-showdown-of-ultimate-destiny">Rainbow Dash and the Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. I'd like to write a snappy synopsis for this one,  but it's just too crazy for that. Yes,  it's based on <em>that</em> Ultimate Showdown. Warning: Abandon all Hope of Anything Making Sense,  Ye Who Enter Here.
<p></p>I think Mendacity was probably my favorite one from this batch,  which was funny because it started out as my least favorite,  but really grew on me. See you next time all!

            My headcanon is that the titles "king" and "queen" can only be taken by those who rule an entire race. As such,  Chrysalis is the queen of everychangeling. Though,  that doesn't mean that nochangeling can disagree with her.

            @Apple: See there's the thing though,  hate isn't the opposite of love. In a way it's sort of similar. It's a strong,  obsessive emotion. I imagine they feed by having energy directed at them,  which hate would do as well.
<p></p>@Lurker: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Does it make it clear they're feeding directly? Because to elaborate I see the Changelings harvesting love,  which then flows to the Queen,  which she uses to power the hive. I view her as basically a corrupted goddess of love,  so she can no longer feed on ambient love but needs it given to her,  and she uses her goddess powers to keep the entire race alive.</span>

            Perhaps they can eat all kinds of emotions but they have different effects (or just flavors) on them. Love may just be the most beneficial to them (and/or delicious).
