            @ Seraph: "But not before he was able to put a curse upon the empire. A curse that caused it to vanish into thin air. If the empire is filled with hope and love,  those things are reflected across all of Equestria. If hatred and fear take hold... Which is why I need your help finding a way to protect it."
<p></p>She knows that the Crystal Empire needs protection from hatred and fear. She knows if it isn't protected Equestria will be failed with those emotions. She uses this as a test.

            Speaking of Man of Steel,  how would those of you that saw it compare it to the other Superman films (well,  assuming you watched them)?  I've only ever seen the original Superman (which I enjoyed,  even if I <em>really</em> didn't find Lex to be villain material) and Superman Returns (which I also liked,  but acknowledge it wasn't nearly as good as Superman I).

            Superman is faster than light. Celestia is dead before she realises anything is wrong. Unless you're reffering to one of the weaker versions of Superman,  in which case you need to specify.
<p></p>When I say Celestia was "holding back",  I don't mean she could have used a more powerful attack (I assume that it <em>was</em> her most powerful beam),  I mean that she just brute forced rather than using strategy,  like raising the temperature of the room several thousand degrees,  summoning a horde of tentacle beasts,  creating a rain of swords etc etc etc.
<p></p>Celestia's strength is in the octillian ton range,  but the more powerful version' of Superman have it at least three orders of magnitude higher. Celestia's only demonstrated quadruple digit mach speed,  rather than the billions of light years per second that the more powerful versions of Superman can achieve. Celestia's destructive capacity is a little over a hundred times what's needed to blow up the solar system,  but her durability isn't much higher. Superman has dealt with <em>far</em> more powerful beings.
<p></p>As for the silliness of Superman's powerlevels,  it's not the powerlevels that matter. It's what you <em>do</em> with them. (Admittedly,  I never liked how stupidly powerful Superman was compared to most of his foes.) <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedakaBox" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a> proves that ridiculous power levels can be fun (of course,  DC has higher power levels than <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedakaBox" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a> does).

            That reminds me,  I'll read anything ponifyed if you guys think it did the source material pretty well. For instance,  <a class="createlink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoE" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoE">Fo E</a>'s given me a good idea of the Fallout universe even if I can't play the games. It's not perfect,  and there's changes,  but still. So I think it could be a way to experience works I normally could not. Thus is the power of ponies.

Superman has dealt with far more powerful beings.</div>
<p></p>Not that I'm doubting you,  but when did Celestia demonstrate all of this?  I don't remember any of that from the show.  (If any of those are from the comic,  just say "Comic."  I don't want to be spoiled just yet.)

<p></p>It's required to move the Sun around the Earth once a day. (Unless you're using weird HAX.) (the durability comes from surviing a beam more powerful than her own in A Canterlot Wedding.) (Admittedly,  I should probably have said <em>telekinetic</em> strength,  but still). Her second best showing is in the comics,  though,  yes.

            All I'm going to say is that it's possible to interpret Celestia's power level as anything from godlike to not much more powerful than Twilight,  and leave it at that.
